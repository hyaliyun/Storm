This version of the program also incorporates a check to ensure minimal CPU usage by introducing a delay within the loop that's waiting for the \\"R\\" key press. Since we want to ensure the program doesn't put undue pressure on the CPU, the loop will include both a mechanism to detect specific key presses efficiently and a sleep period to reduce active polling. This approach helps in managing CPU usage. Here's how you could implement this: \`\`\`python import ctypes import keyboard import time # Constants MONITOR_OFF = 2 SC_MONITORPOWER = 0xF170 HWND_BROADCAST = 0xFFFF def turn_off_display(): \\"\\"\\"Turn off the display.\\"\\"\\" ctypes.windll.user32.SendMessageW(HWND_BROADCAST, 0x0112, SC_MONITORPOWER, MONITOR_OFF) def on_press_reaction(event): \\"\\"\\"Function to react to keypress events.\\"\\"\\" if event.name == 'r': # Display will turn on by any keypress including R, due to hardware default behavior # Placeholder for turning on display logic if needed print(\\"R pressed, display turns on by default behavior.\\") else: # Turn off the display again when other keys are pressed time.sleep(1) # Small delay to allow the display to react turn_off_display() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": print(\\"Press 'R' to keep the display on.

Just keep the program running. time.sleep(1) except KeyboardInterrupt: print(\\"Program exited gracefully.\\") \`\`\` **Key Points and Considerations:** 1. **Minimal CPU Usage:** This script achieves low CPU usage by implementing a sleep mechanism within the infinite loop, significantly reducing the need for active polling. 2. **Key Press Handling:** The \`keyboard.on_press\` function is utilized to listen for any keypress events efficiently. This approach is more CPU-friendly compared to actively polling the keyboard state in a tight loop. 3. **Turning on the Display:** Most modern displays will automatically wake from a power-saving mode when they detect a key press or mouse movement. This means we don't need specific code to turn the display back on—it’s handled by the hardware itself. The script implicitly takes advantage of this behavior by allowing any keypress, including \\"R\\", to wake the display. 4. **Dependencies:** This script requires the \`keyboard\` module, which can be installed using \`pip install keyboard\`. 5. **Privileges:** Note that listening for keyboard events globally may require administrative privileges. Make sure to run the script with appropriate permissions if you encounter permission errors. 6. **Platform Specificity:** This implementation is mainly intended for Windows, given the use of \`ctypes.windll\`. For cross-platform functionality, additional considerations or methods would be required."},{"prompt":"import ctypes import keyboard import time # Constants MONITOR_OFF = 2 SC_MONITORPOWER = 0xF170 HWND_BROADCAST = 0xFFFF def turn_off_display(): ctypes.windll.user32.SendMessageW(HWND_BROADCAST, 0x0112, SC_MONITORPOWER, MONITOR_OFF) def on_press_reaction(event): if event.name == 'r': print(\\"R pressed, display turns on by default behavior.\\") else: time.sleep(1) turn_off_display() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": print(\\"Press 'R' to keep the display on.

This will allow for specific actions based on whether \\"E\\" or \\"R\\" is pressed.

This function will print a message indicating the action taken. - The sleep in the main loop has been set to \`0.1\` seconds to balance between responsiveness and CPU usage. Feel free to adjust this value based on your needs. Remember, to run this script, you need administrative privileges because it listens for global keyboard events.

This delay is a trade-off to reduce CPU usage. If you need the script to respond even quicker, you could reduce the sleep time further, but be mindful that doing so might increase CPU usage. 2. **Preventing Mouse Movements or Other Keys from Waking the Screen**: Preventing any hardware (like the mouse or keyboard) from waking the screen after it has been turned off is more challenging because such behavior is typically controlled at the hardware level or via the operating system's power settings, not directly through simple software commands. For keyboards and mice, their ability to wake the system from a low-power state is often controlled by the device's properties in the operating system's device manager or within UEFI/BIOS settings. Disabling them through a Python script isn't straightforward or universally applicable, as it would require modifying system settings or device configurations that are not typically exposed to high-level programming interfaces for security and stability reasons. However, addressing the provided code and the intention behind disabling wake events from mouse and keyboards through pure Python scripting, keep in mind that: - The script cannot directly prevent hardware from waking the screen; this functionality is dependent on the operating system and hardware behavior. - Implementing a way to disable wake-up from mouse and keyboard events programmatically involves system configuration changes outside the scope of the script and might require administrative permissions, making it not practical to achieve through a simple Python script. **Given these considerations**, the script you have focuses on responding to specific keyboard events to turn the display off or on and cannot inherently control hardware or OS-level wake policies. For **detailed system configuration** to manage device wake-up capabilities, you would typically look into: - **Device Manager (Windows)**: Where you can access device properties (like for keyboards and mice) and sometimes disable the ability for these devices to wake the system from sleep. - **UEFI/BIOS settings**: Some systems allow control over USB and peripheral wake-up behavior at the BIOS/UEFI firmware level. - **Operating System Power Management Settings**: Both Windows and Linux offer power management configurations that can sometimes limit wake-up sources. These actions require manual intervention or administrative scripts/tools that are specific to each operating system and hardware configuration and are outside the direct purview of Python scripting for cross-platform application."},{"prompt":"import ctypes import keyboard import time # Constants for controlling the monitor power MONITOR_OFF = 2 SC_MONITORPOWER = 0xF170 HWND_BROADCAST = 0xFFFF def turn_off_display(): “”“Turn off the display.”“” ctypes.windll.user32.SendMessageW(HWND_BROADCAST, 0x0112, SC_MONITORPOWER, MONITOR_OFF) def turn_on_display(): “”“Placeholder for the code triggering the display to turn on.

This means the script checks for keypresses every 0.1 seconds. 2. **Preventing Mouse and Keyboard from Waking the Screen**: This requirement goes beyond what can be controlled through a simple Python script because it involves deep system-level configurations or behaviors related to how the operating system and hardware manage power states and wake events. However, if your primary goal is to control the screen power state in response to specific keyboard events and you wish for a simple, straightforward script for educational or personal use, the provided code already outlines a basic approach for turning off the display with the \\"E\\" key and reacting to the \\"R\\" key, though turning the screen back on is generally handled by the system.

Or if it's boring, regular classes with tests, with a frequent sparring sessions with professional, experienced superheroes to hone one's skills, superpowers or abilities. Even within the confines of the Academy of Extraordinary Children, normal life problems and worries are still part of everyday life. At least, this was the case for the 14-year-old Alex, who's superpowers involve to controlling and manipulating of elements, like fire, water, air, earth, wood, metal, electricity, light, darkness, stone, sand, you name it. One should know that he and four other 14-year-olds were a nearly inseparable group. Sharon, who's powers are super strength, flight and laser vision, Daniel, who was a normal human with a summoning ability that allows him to call forth superpowered animals, Kathy, the daughter of the famous superhero, Limitless Lightning (real name, Arthur Kenward), who can run faster than the speed of sound, and Neil, who possesses an incredible healing factor he can transfer to his friends due to him being the host of an ancient evil entity that he keeps suppressed by his own willpower alone. \\"Hey, uh, Ethan? I need you talk to you.\\", said Alex to his teacher, Ethan G. S. Marigold. Ethan G. S. Marigold was an interesting case for superhero standards. His control and manipulation of gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces, the four fundamental forces, made him seem like a nearly untouchable godlike figure in society. Coupled with him being a member of the prestigious Marigold superhero family, as well as is aloofness and cockiness, and his insistence of having no superhero name or costume, since, in his own words, \\"Why should I hide my identity, if I'm too untouchable?\\", made others think that he was too arrogant, and unfit to be a teacher in the Academy of Extraordinary Children. And yet, despite his power and wealth, he was rather approachable and down-to-earth with the students, especially with Alex, Sharon, Daniel, Kathy, and Neil. He was much an older brother figure to the five as he was their teacher. \\"Alex, my guy. What's up\\", replied Ethan to Alex, ditching his usual daily latte for an energy drink. \\"Hey, so I have a problem that I feel like I need to talk to you about?\\", asked back Alex. \\"If it's about the next assignment, you'll be fine, you and the others should be good.\\" \\"It's not that.\\" Ethan noted Alex's unusually long silence. And then he found out what's really wrong with Alex. \\"Oh, I see. Girl trouble.\\", teased Ethan. Alex could only smile a little, answering back, \\"That obvious, huh?\\" \\"I can see it in your face. So, I'm aware you don't have a girlfriend, so I'm guessing it's an awkward crush.\\" \\"Yeah, actually.\\" Ethan pieced it together too quickly. People tend to forget with his power and wealth, Ethan was exceptionally smart and strategic. \\"Oh, my goodness. It's Sharon, isn't it?\\" Alex could only ask, \\"I can't be that predictable?'\\" Ethan replied, \\"I'm only 29, but the old childhood friend developing into an awkward crush once teenagehood arrives scenario? Timeless. And you can't even tell her because of that friendship between you two and what might happen with the others. So, you came to me to either talk, get some advice, or both.\\"","completion":"Alex nodded, his gaze shifting to the floor, a mix of anticipation and nervousness swirling within him. \\"Yeah, it's Sharon.

I don’t want to mess things up between us or within our group.\\" Ethan took a slow sip from his energy drink, allowing the moment to sit before he spoke. \\"Alright, Alex. First off, feelings like these are normal, especially at your age. The bonds you form now are strong, intense even. It's not uncommon for those feelings to evolve. But, handling them, that's where the tricky part comes in.\\" He paused, pondering his next piece of advice. \\"You've got a solid group of friends, and I've seen you all tackle missions that would make seasoned heroes think twice. That says a lot about your unity and trust. So, here's my take—honesty, but with tact and timing. You don't want to blindside Sharon or put her on the spot, especially not with a villain to defeat or a crisis to avert.\\" Ethan shifted in his chair, leaning forward slightly. \\"Consider your approach. Maybe find a quiet moment when you're both at ease. Share your feelings without the expectation that she must reciprocate. Make it clear that your friendship with her, and the group's dynamic, is your priority. That way, she knows where you stand, but also that you value her and the group above all else.\\" Alex listened intently, absorbing every word. It made sense; it was logical yet mindful of the emotional stakes at play. \\"What if... what if she doesn't feel the same way?\\" he asked, a hard lump forming in his throat. Ethan's expression softened. \\"Then, you respect her feelings and move forward. Your strength as a person, not just as a hero with powers, comes from handling personal challenges with grace and maturity. It might sting, sure, but remember, your worth isn't tied to someone else's feelings for you. Plus, you're surrounded by friends who care about you deeply. That counts for a lot, Alex.\\" A small, grateful smile tugged at the corners of Alex's lips. \\"Thanks, Ethan. That... actually helps a lot. I just need to gather some courage now.\\" Ethan clapped him on the shoulder, a reassuring gesture. \\"You've faced supervillains and averted catastrophes, Alex. This is just another challenge, and you're not alone. Whatever happens, you've got a solid support system right here. And who knows? Life has a funny way of surprising us sometimes.\\" Alex stood, feeling a weight lifted off his shoulders, yet fully aware of the challenge that lay ahead. With Ethan's advice in mind, he felt prepared—or at least as prepared as one could be—to face the complexities of teenage emotions head-on. Beyond the superpowers and heroic feats, it was moments like these that truly tested the mettle of the extraordinary students at the Academy of Extraordinary Children."},{"prompt":"'' iCloud 백업에서 복원하는 데 실패'' 문제 해결 '시리야' 말할 필요 없어 iOS17 새로운 기능 \\"HTML 5 비디오를 찾을 수 없습니다\\" 문제 해결 방법 【html mp4 재생 안됨】 \\"iPhone에서 메시지를 계속 삭제\\" 문제 해결 방법 \\"Windows에서 대상 폴더 액세스 거부\\" 문제 해결 방법 [2023] 몇 클릭만으로 크리스마스 영상, 카드 만드는 방법 [ 2024 ] GPS 조작 프로그램 TOP 6 추천 [2024] iCloud 백업 복구: 삭제된 아이폰 아이 클라우드 백업 데이터 복구 방법 [ 2024 ]iPhone에서 삭제된 LINE 대화/메시지 기록을 복원하는 방법 [2024] iPhone에서 영구적으로 지우된 파일을 복구하는 방법 [ 2024 ]SD카드에서 삭제한 파일 복구하는 방법 [ 2024 ]Top 10 무료 SD카드 데이터 복구 프로그램 [ 2024 ] Top 5 맥북 영상 편집 프로그램 [ 2024 ] Top 5 안드로이드 화면 미러링 프로그램 [ 2024 ] YouTube MP3 음원 추출 방법 - 무료로 즐기는 3가지 방법 [2024] 무료 갤럭시 초기화 복구 프로그램 추천- 데이터 복구 프로그램 상세 소개 [ 2024 ]아이 클라우드 백업 복원: 아이폰 iCloud 백업 데이터 복구 방법 4가지 [ 2024 ] 아이폰 DFU 모드로 진입하는 방법 소개 [2024] 아이폰 삭제된 메시지 복구하는 3가지 방법 [ 2024 ] 아이폰 통화 볼륨이 낮은 문제를 해결하는 방법 [2024] 아이폰 휴지통 복구 방법| 삭제된 파일을 다시 찾아보자!

Complete Domain Setup\\" I click GO and it goes to my list of domains but does not tell me what to do","completion":"When you encounter a message like \\"! Complete Domain Setup\\" in your WordPress account, it means there are additional steps needed to fully configure your domain for use with your site. This can include verifying the domain, updating settings, or mapping the domain correctly. If clicking \\"GO\\" doesn't provide clear instructions or leads you to your list of domains without further guidance, follow these general steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue: 1. **Check Domain Verification**: Some domains need verification, particularly if they are newly registered. Look for any verification emails from your domain registrar or from WordPress and follow the instructions provided. 2. **DNS Settings**: Ensure your domain's DNS settings are correctly pointed to your WordPress site. This typically involves pointing your domain's nameservers to WordPress or setting up A records to direct the domain to WordPress's servers. The specific records you need can usually be found in your WordPress account's domain management section or in their help documentation. 3. **Domain Mapping**: If you're using a domain registered elsewhere with WordPress, you may need to complete a domain mapping process. This should be guided within your account, under the domains section. Ensure you've followed all the steps for mapping your domain to your WordPress site. 4. **Review Domain Settings**: Within your WordPress account, navigate to your domain settings and review them for any incomplete actions or alerts. Sometimes, the platform flags specific issues that need to be resolved. 5. **Contact Support**: If after performing the above steps you're still facing issues, the best course of action is to contact WordPress support. Use the support or contact section of your WordPress account to get in touch. Provide them with details of your issue, including what you see and what steps you've already taken. WordPress support is typically responsive and can provide detailed assistance specific to your situation. 6. **Consult WordPress Documentation and Forums**: While waiting for a response from support or if you're seeking immediate answers, explore WordPress's extensive documentation and forums. Many users have likely faced similar issues, and solutions are often documented in these resources. Remember, domain setup issues can vary greatly depending on the specifics of your situation, such as where your domain is registered and the type of WordPress plan you have.

The distinction between the South Bronx and the North Bronx was quite stark in terms of socio-economic status, infrastructure, and overall living conditions. Here's a closer look at the conditions in both areas during that time: # South Bronx: The South Bronx was emblematic of urban decay and is often cited as a quintessential example of the challenges facing American inner cities during the 1970s. Key characteristics of the South Bronx during this time include: - **Widespread Poverty:** The area was one of the poorest in the United States. High unemployment rates and a lack of economic opportunities exacerbated the situation. - **Deteriorating Infrastructure:** Many buildings and apartments were in poor condition. Landlords, unable to profit from these properties, often neglected them or, in some notorious cases, resorted to arson to collect insurance money. This led to numerous fires, earning the South Bronx the moniker \\"the burning borough.\\" - **Crime:** The area was plagued with high rates of crime, including gang activity, drug trade, and theft, contributing to a sense of insecurity among residents. - **Population Decline:** The South Bronx faced a significant population decline as those who were able to leave the area did so in search of better living conditions. - **Racial and Ethnic Tensions:** The South Bronx was, and still is, a diverse community. However, during the 1970s, racial and ethnic tensions were exacerbated by economic hardships, with communities of color being especially hard-hit. # North Bronx: In contrast, the North Bronx presented a somewhat more stable environment during this period. Though not without its challenges, it generally fared better in terms of economic stability and quality of life: - **Better Housing Conditions:** The North Bronx had areas with more affluent neighborhoods and stable housing situations. The housing stock included single-family homes, well-maintained apartment complexes, and co-ops which were in better physical condition than those in the South Bronx. - **Lower Crime Rates:** While crime was a city-wide issue during the 1970s, the North Bronx generally experienced lower crime rates compared to the South Bronx. - **Greener and More Residential:** The North Bronx, particularly areas toward the city's outskirts, was greener and had more parks and recreational spaces. It had a more suburban feel compared to the more urban South Bronx. - **Economic Stability:** Although not completely immune to the economic issues affecting New York City, the North Bronx had pockets of economic stability with thriving local businesses and a lower unemployment rate than the South Bronx. Overall, the stark contrast between the South and North Bronx during 1974 underscored broader themes of urban decay, economic disparity, and social challenges that were prevalent in New York City and in many other American cities during this era.

Given your event manager setup, let's break this down into the actionable steps for your \`InputManager\`'s constructor to subscribe to keyboard key down events using your \`EventManager\` class. First, ensure you have an event handler function in your \`InputManager\` class (or wherever you want to handle the event) that matches the expected signature for the \`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\`. This function should accept a \`std::shared_ptr\` to a \`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\`. Here's a basic example: \`\`\`cpp class InputManager { public: InputManager() { // Subscribe to KeyboardKeyDownEvent in the constructor EventManager::GetInstance().Subscribe<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>( std::bind(&InputManager::HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent, this, std::placeholders::_1) ); } void HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::shared_ptr<KeyboardKeyDownEvent> event) { // Handle the event, for example: std::cout << \\"Keyboard key down event received. KeyCode: \\" << event->GetKeyCode() << std::endl; } }; \`\`\` In the above example, \`HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent\` is the event handler function designed to react to \`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\` instances. When subscribing, we've utilized \`std::bind\` to generate an appropriate function object that can be passed to \`EventManager::Subscribe\`. Here, \`std::placeholders::_1\` is used to represent the first argument that will be passed to \`HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent\` when the event occurs. This argument is of type \`std::shared_ptr<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>\`, as required. It's important to note that your \`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\` should properly inherit from an \`Event\` class as expected by the \`static_assert\` in your \`Subscribe\` method implementation. Also, ensure your event classes have virtual destructors if they're meant to be base classes with derived types, which seems to be the case here. Lastly, make sure the \`EventManager\` and other involved classes are fully implemented with necessary functionalities such as an event dispatch mechanism to invoke these subscribed handlers accordingly when an event of the type \`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\` is emitted or posted. This example gives a basic illustration of how to subscribe to a keyboard key down event in your game engine using the described event management approach. Depending on your engine's architecture, you might need to adjust scope and lifetime management aspects to ensure everything works smoothly in a larger application context."},{"prompt":"I don't understand the std::placeholders::_1 part and why that has to be in this part. My first idea was doing something like this instead of using a bind function: EventManager::GetInstance().Subscribe([this](std::shared_ptr<Event> event){ this->HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>(event)); });","completion":"Your alternative approach using a lambda function instead of \`std::bind\` is valid and, in many cases, preferred due to its clarity and directness. The use of \`std::placeholders::_1\` in the original example with \`std::bind\` serves to create a placeholder for the function argument that will be passed in when the function is called. This approach can sometimes feel a bit abstract or overly verbose for straightforward use cases. Your lambda-based solution is a modern C++ approach that leverages lambda expressions to capture the \`this\` pointer, thus allowing you to call member functions directly within the lambda body. This way, you can directly process or cast the event to the specific type you expect (\`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\` in this case) inside the lambda before passing it to your handler function. Let’s look more closely at your lambda approach: \`\`\`cpp EventManager::GetInstance().Subscribe([this](std::shared_ptr<Event> event){ this->HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>(event)); }); \`\`\` Here’s why this works and is actually a neat solution: 1. **Capture \`[this]\`**: By capturing \`this\` in the lambda, you gain access to the instance (and its member functions) from which \`Subscribe\` is being called. In this case, it allows calling \`HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent\` on this specific instance of your class where the subscription is made. 2. **Lambda argument**: The lambda takes a \`std::shared_ptr<Event>\` as its argument. This matches the expectation that any event passed to subscribers can be any derived type of \`Event\`. Your event system should be designed to handle this generality. 3. **Static cast inside the lambda**: Inside the lambda, you use \`std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>(event)\` to cast the \`std::shared_ptr<Event>\` to \`std::shared_ptr<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>\`, the specific event type you're interested in. This cast aligns with the handler function's expected argument type. 4. **Direct invocation of your handler**: After casting, you directly call \`HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent\` with the specifically casted event pointer. Your approach simplifies the use of lambdas for event handling in modern C++ and leverages type casting to ensure the handler receives the correct event type. It effectively bypasses the need for \`std::bind\` and placeholders, providing a more intuitive way of setting up event handlers, especially when they involve member functions and need access to the instance's state. Remember to ensure safety in type casting (\`std::static_pointer_cast\`). It assumes that the cast is always valid. If there's any chance that an event could be of a different type, consider safeguards against improper casting (e.g., using \`std::dynamic_pointer_cast\` and checking the result before usage, though this is generally not necessary if your event dispatching ensures type correctness)."},{"prompt":"I see, but it is giving errors: /src/InputManager.cpp: In constructor ‘InputManager::InputManager()’: /src/InputManager.cpp:16:42: error: no matching function for call to ‘EventManager::Subscribe(InputManager::InputManager()::<lambda(std::shared_ptr<Event>)>)’ 16 | EventManager::GetInstance().Subscribe([this](std::shared_ptr<Event> event){ | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 17 | this->HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>(event)); | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 18 | }); | ~~ In file included from /src/InputManager.cpp:7: include/EventManager.h:24:14: note: candidate: ‘template<class T> void EventManager::Subscribe(std::function<void(std::shared_ptr<_Tp>)>)’ 24 | void Subscribe(std::function<void(std::shared_ptr<T>)> handler); | ^~~~~~~~~ include/EventManager.h:24:14: note: template argument deduction/substitution failed: /src/InputManager.cpp:16:42: note: ‘InputManager::InputManager()::<lambda(std::shared_ptr<Event>)>’ is not derived from ‘std::function<void(std::shared_ptr<_Tp>)>’ 16 | EventManager::GetInstance().Subscribe([this](std::shared_ptr<Event> event){ | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 17 | this->HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(std::static_pointer_cast<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>(event)); | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 18 | }); | ~~","completion":"The error you're encountering stems from a type mismatch issue between the lambda function you're trying to pass to the \`Subscribe\` method and what the \`Subscribe\` method expects. The \`Subscribe\` method is templated to take a \`std::function<void(std::shared_ptr<T>)>\` where \`T\` should inherit from \`Event\`. However, due to the way C++ templates work, the compiler is unable to automatically deduce \`T\` from the lambda because it doesn't match directly due to the lambda accepting a \`std::shared_ptr<Event>\` instead of a \`std::shared_ptr<SpecificEventType>\` . This issue can be resolved by making the lambda's input argument type match the expected template parameter for \`Subscribe\`. Given the constraints, a possible workaround involves explicitly specifying the template parameter for \`Subscribe\` to the type \`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\` and adjusting the lambda to expect a \`std::shared_ptr<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>\` directly. However, since you having issues with direct casting inside lambda let's try another approach based on your error message: \`\`\`cpp EventManager::GetInstance().Subscribe<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>( [this](std::shared_ptr<KeyboardKeyDownEvent> event) { this->HandleKeyboardKeyDownEvent(event); } ); \`\`\` The above code snippet makes the necessary adjustments: - It explicitly specifies the type for the template parameter when calling \`Subscribe\`, making it \`Subscribe<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>\`. - The lambda function now correctly expects a \`std::shared_ptr<KeyboardKeyDownEvent>\` parameter, perfectly aligning with the expected type argument deduction for the \`Subscribe\` method. This way, your subscription matches the specific event type \`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\` directly, and the lambda signature directly matches the expected \`std::function\` signature required by \`Subscribe\`.

Both approaches have merits, so let's discuss the considerations: # 1. Passing the entire event object: Advantages: - **Flexibility**: Handlers have access to all the event's data, making this approach more flexible. If the event object carries multiple pieces of information (beyond just a key code), the handler can use whatever it needs. - **Future-proofing**: If you later decide to add more data to an event, handlers already receiving the whole event object won't need to change their signature to access the new data. - **Consistency**: If you use a base \`Event\` class from which all events derive, handlers can be written to accept this base class, making your event handling system more consistent. Disadvantages: - **Overhead**: Handlers might receive more information than they need, which could be seen as an unnecessary complexity. - **Coupling**: By passing the entire event object, you're coupling the handler more tightly to the event's structure and type. # 2. Passing just the specific data needed: Advantages: - **Simplicity**: Handlers receive only the data they need, which can simplify their implementation. - **Decoupling**: This reduces the coupling between event producers and consumers. Handlers don't need to know about the event object's structure, just the information they need to act upon. - **Performance**: By avoiding the passing of potentially large event objects (in cases where events carry a lot of data), there might be performance benefits, although this is usually negligible in all but the most performance-critical situations. Disadvantages: - **Scalability**: If the data needed by handlers grows or changes over time, you might find yourself frequently changing handler signatures, which can be a maintenance hassle. - **Lack of Context**: Handlers receive only a piece of the event's data, so if additional context from the event becomes necessary later, you would need to refactor your handlers to accept more parameters or to revert to passing the entire event object. # Decision: - If your events carry multiple pieces of data and you expect that handlers might need different pieces of this data, or the event's structure might evolve over time, opt for **passing the entire event object**. - If your events are simple, the handlers only need one piece of data from the event, and you prefer to keep event handling lightweight and decoupled, **passing just the specific data** might be preferable. For many game engines and more complex applications, starting with passing the entire event object can be a good default due to its flexibility and future-proof nature. It's a common pattern in event-driven designs because it simplifies the evolution of the system. However, for specific, high-frequency events where performance is critical, and the event structure is guaranteed to remain simple, passing just the necessary data could be advantageous. Given these considerations, you should choose the approach that best aligns with your current and anticipated needs. Remember, consistency in how you handle events can also reduce cognitive load and make your codebase easier to understand and maintain."},{"prompt":"I think the flexibility is important and as you say, it could be the best default and then if something is slow I can just refactor it later, also it will help me to keep it like that because I could receive and event and publish it again, if that makes sense. Also, since it is a std::shared_ptr, there is no need for delete the pointer or anything like that, right?","completion":"Yes, your reasoning is sound. Opting for flexibility, especially during the initial phases of development, can indeed prove beneficial. Designing your system to handle entire event objects provides the versatility needed to expand or modify your event structure without necessitating widespread changes across your event handlers. This approach grants you the leeway to adapt as the requirements of your game engine evolve. As for your question regarding \`std::shared_ptr\`: Correct, one of the primary advantages of using \`std::shared_ptr\` (and smart pointers in general) is automatic memory management. When you use a \`std::shared_ptr\` to manage the lifetime of an object, the need to manually \`delete\` the object is eliminated. The object will be automatically deleted when the last \`std::shared_ptr\` owning it is destroyed or reset, meaning when the reference count drops to zero, the managed object is deleted. This feature is particularly useful in the context of an event management system for a couple of reasons: 1. **Thread Safety**: In a multithreaded environment, it might be hard to determine when an event is no longer in use. With \`std::shared_ptr\`, as long as you pass and store shared pointers to the object, it will exist as long as there's at least one owner alive. Once the last reference is gone (for example, all handlers have finished processing the event), the object is safely deleted. 2. **Ease of Passing Around**: Since \`std::shared_ptr\` manages the memory for you, passing events across different parts of your application (such as different subsystems or event listeners/handlers) is simplified. You won't have to worry about the lifecycle of the event object beyond ensuring that you maintain a \`std::shared_ptr\` to it as long as needed. 3. **Flexibility in Event Publishing**: As you mentioned, receiving an event and publishing it again becomes straightforward with \`std::shared_ptr\`. You can republish an event to different parts of your system without worrying about copying the event or managing its memory. This can be particularly useful in complex systems where events may need to be consumed by multiple subsystems or in different contexts. In summary, using \`std::shared_ptr\` for managing event objects in your event system is indeed a prudent choice. It provides automatic memory management, reduces the manual workload associated with dynamic memory, and adds a layer of safety and convenience to your system design."},{"prompt":"Ok perfect, i like how this is working out, now my old update method won't be needed anymore, right?

However, the necessity and presence of \`Update\` methods in your system will largely depend on the specific responsibilities of each component and how they've been designed to interact within your new event-driven framework. Let's break down some considerations regarding your \`Update\` method within an event-driven architecture: # 1. **Legacy Update Loops May Still Have a Role** - **Continuous State Checks**: Some game systems might still need to continuously check or update certain states every frame, independent of discrete events. For example, physics simulations or continuous AI decision-making might still primarily occur within an \`Update\` loop. - **Background Tasks**: Tasks that aren't directly triggered by events, such as pre-loading assets in the background or checking for network messages in a non-event-based networking model, might still use traditional update loops. # 2. **Event-Driven Input Handling** - **Immediate Event Processing**: Your transition to event-driven input handling means that specific event handling (like \`SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN\` or \`SDL_CONTROLLERBUTTONDOWN\`) will move to event listeners or handlers instead of being checked in a poll-style loop within \`Update\`. - **State Management**: Your example \`Update\` method includes state management code (\`previousKeyboardState = currentKeyboardState;\` and \`UpdateKeyboardState();\`). In an event-driven model, you might still track input state changes triggered by events to maintain a current snapshot of input states, but how and where this state tracking occurs might shift. You could update states in response to events directly, or use a dedicated method post-event-processing to reconcile state. # 3. **Adapting Your Update Loop** - **Event Polling**: The polling of SDL events (\`SDL_PollEvent\`) is a critical operation that must occur to ensure SDL events are processed. In an event-driven model, this loop might still exist but could be repurposed solely to dispatch events to the appropriate handlers rather than processing logic directly in the switch-case structure. - **Event Dispatching**: Your SDL event polling loop could become a place where SDL events are translated into your engine-specific events and then dispatched through your event management system. This keeps the interface between SDL and your game engine clear and contained. # Considerations for Adoption - **Hybrid Approach**: It's common for engines to use a hybrid approach where some systems are event-driven (especially for discrete events like input handling), while others continue using polling or update patterns where continuous checks or operations are necessary. - **Performance and Complexity**: An event-driven model can simplify the flow of information and reduce unnecessary checks (e.g., for input that hasn't changed), potentially improving performance and lowering complexity. However, the design and debugging of event-driven systems can initially feel more complex due to the decoupled nature of event publishers and subscribers. In summary, while event-driven designs can significantly streamline and improve input handling and other event-based responses, you might still find use for \`Update\` methods, especially for continuous or non-discrete state updates. Be mindful to balance the benefits of event-driven patterns with the clarity and simplicity of your engine's overall architecture."},{"prompt":"I understood, and yeah I will keep Update methods when needed, but in this case it is not, I could do two things here, 1) Handle all the events in each Handle function (my prefered option, makes more sense to me.) 2) Keep the Update function that will be called by every other Handle function with their own Event and then use a switch to decide that to do (I don't like this option). which one of this is the best in this use case? also I will have to move the previousKeyboardState = currentKeyboardState; // event handling UpdateKeyboardState(); to keyboardkeydown and keyboardkeyup hanlding, right?","completion":"Given your two options and considering the advantages of an event-driven architecture, your preference for handling all the events in each dedicated \`Handle\` function (Option 1) does indeed align better with the principles of event-driven design and has several benefits: # Advantages of Handling Events in Dedicated Functions: - **Clarity and Separation of Concerns**: Handling each type of event in its dedicated handler function improves readability and maintainability. It's easier to understand and debug event handling logic when it's not intermixed with unrelated event types or conditional branching logic based on event types. - **Decoupling**: This approach further decouples your event processing logic from the event dispatch mechanism, allowing you change how events are dispatched or handled without impacting the other. - **Flexibility**: You have more flexibility to handle the nuances of each event type without being constrained by a monolithic \`Update\` function that tries to accommodate all possible event types. - **Scalability**: As your engine grows to include more event types, having dedicated handlers makes it simpler to add new event handling logic without risking the introduction of bugs into an oversized, centralized event processing function. Regarding moving \`previousKeyboardState = currentKeyboardState;\` and \`UpdateKeyboardState();\` to the \`KeyboardKeyDown\` and \`KeyboardKeyUp\` handling: - To maintain a responsive and accurate input system, updating the keyboard state around event dispatches is indeed necessary. However, how you manage state updates should depend on the structure and flow of event information in your system. - If \`KeyboardKeyDown\` and \`KeyboardKeyUp\` events are discrete and represent all changes to the keyboard state, then updating the keyboard state in response to these events can be a sensible approach. However, it’s important to ensure that your design captures all necessary state changes and that the state is updated in a coherent manner that reflects the actual sequence of inputs. - Note that some systems might still benefit from a periodic \\"state reconciliation\\" step to ensure system states are synchronized especially if there are multiple sources of events or state changes that might not all be captured cleanly in event handlers. This doesn't seem to be your primary case, but it's something to keep in mind for complex systems. - A potential optimization, if event rate is high, is batching or coalescing state changes within a single frame/loop iteration, to minimize overhead from processing state changes. This would be more relevant if you find performance issues with high-frequency events. In summary, your preferred approach of handling events in dedicated \`Handle\` functions aligns well with the desired characteristics of an event-driven system and is generally the best practice for such designs. Plus, adapting your state management to align with event handling, while ensuring all necessary state transitions are captured, is aligned with maintaining responsive and accurate input handling."},{"prompt":"Ok I found out that both of the keyboard events will be handled with the same code, in this case should I point both to the same Handle function or make it separated even though they would end up doing the same?

In this case, rationalizing the code by pointing both event types to the same handler function can be a justifiable design decision, emphasizing code reuse and simplification. However, before making this decision, consider the following aspects: # Maintainability and Future Expansion - Separating handlers for \`KeyDown\` and \`KeyUp\` events keeps the door open for future modifications where you might want to handle these events differently. If you anticipate any divergence in how you want to handle key down versus key up in the future, maintaining separate handlers could save you refactoring time later. # Code Semantics - Having distinct functions for handling different event types can enhance code semantics, making it clearer at a glance what types of events your system is designed to handle, even if the current logic is identical. # Performance Considerations - The overhead of having two separate but identical functions is minimal in the context of your overall engine performance. The primary concern in event handling is typically the efficiency of the event dispatching mechanism rather than the granularity of the handler functions. # Practical Approach for Your Case If you're confident that the logic for handling \`KeyboardKeyDown\` and \`KeyboardKeyUp\` events will remain unified and simplicity is a paramount concern, you could indeed opt to direct both to a single handler method. One way to implement this without making the handler specific to either event type is by using a more generic event type or interface if applicable in your design. Alternatively, consider naming the method in a way that reflects its purpose rather than the specific event it's handling, something like \`HandleKeyboardStateUpdate\`. Here’s how you might adjust your handlers to follow this approach: \`\`\`cpp void InputManager::HandleKeyboardStateUpdate() { previousKeyboardState = currentKeyboardState; UpdateKeyboardState(); } \`\`\` Then, ensure both \`KeyboardKeyDownEvent\` and \`KeyboardKeyUpEvent\` subscriptions point to this method. If your event system or language features require passing a specific event argument to every handler function, you might keep the parameter in the method signature but leave it unused within the method body, or adjust the subscription mechanism to allow for event-agnostic handlers, depending on your system's capabilities and constraints. Remember, the final decision should align with your project's specific needs, considering factors like code maintainability, potential future requirements, and overall system complexity. Choosing a path that keeps your codebase understandable, maintainable, and adaptable is generally preferable."},{"prompt":"What about my second concern: \\"I am not even using the event information, I just calculate the keyboard state without taking the key into account, this is the way I had before but seems like too much overhead, or not, but at least it keeps all the states consistently, what do you think?\\"","completion":"Your approach to managing keyboard states by recalculating the entire state each time a key event occurs, rather than updating based on the specific key involved in the event, provides a blanket solution that ensures the consistency of your keyboard state representation.

This can simplify debugging and ensure that the representation of the keyboard state is always reliable. # Performance Considerations - For most applications, especially games where real-time interaction is crucial, the overhead introduced by updating the entire keyboard state is minimal and likely not a performance bottleneck. Modern hardware can easily handle such operations at a very high frequency. The simplicity and reliability benefits often outweigh the minimal performance costs. # Future-proofing - Your current design is robust against changes in how input is handled or processed elsewhere in your system. If your game or application evolves to include complex input combinations or requires a holistic view of the input state for features like gesture recognition, your current approach could prove advantageous. # Comparison with Individual Key Updates - The alternative approach, updating the state based on individual keys, would require handling each key event separately, adjusting the corresponding state, and ensuring no conflicts or missed updates occur. This can introduce complexity and might make it harder to maintain a perfectly accurate overall input state, especially considering edge cases like missed events or rapid key toggling. # Event Information Utilization - Even though you're not using the event-specific information (like which key was pressed or released) directly, capturing every key event to update the state ensures you're not missing any changes. This comprehensive capture mechanism provides a strong foundation for features that may rely on knowing the complete state at any given moment. # Decision Balance Given these considerations, your approach is not unwarranted, especially if your application benefits from or requires a consistent and reliable representation of the keyboard state at all times. You should balance this with the realization that, in very performance-critical sections or on significantly constrained hardware, the added overhead might become non-negligible. However, for the vast majority of use cases in game development on contemporary hardware, the impact should be minimal. It's always wise to remain open to revisiting such design decisions as your project progresses and as you gain more insights into your specific performance requirements and usage patterns. Regular profiling can help identify if and when the approach becomes a performance bottleneck, prompting a more optimized solution, possibly involving selective state updates based on individual key events."},{"prompt":"OK I will leave it like that, and call it a day. but now another problem arised, My InputManager has a collection of Gamepads, now I can't use the subscribe event for the gamepad class since the input manager is the one that handles everything about the gamepad and has the collection of gamepads, so I don't know where should I put the subscribe in these cases. 1) Should I subscribe for the gamepad events in the InputManager and call an Update method with an Event and then do a switch case to determine which event subclass is and handle them privately? 2) Should I make the Handle gamepad methods public and be accesed from the InputManager, which makes them being calleable from everywhere which is not my design purpose? 3) Another alternative I am missing?","completion":"Given your scenario, where the \`InputManager\` is responsible for managing gamepad input and possesses a collection of \`Gamepad\` instances, let’s explore the best way to architect your event handling around these requirements. The goal is to preserve encapsulation and maintainability while ensuring flexibility. # Option Analysis 1. Subscribing to Gamepad Events in the InputManager - **Pros**: Centralizes gamepad event handling in a component that logically owns these responsibilities. Keeps \`Gamepad\` class interface cleaner. - **Cons**: Might lead to a bulky \`InputManager::Update\` method with a switch-case structure to handle different gamepad events. This approach aligns with encapsulation principles by keeping gamepad-specific event handling within the context of the \`InputManager\`. It maintains a clear separation of concerns, where the \`InputManager\` acts as a dispatcher that routes events to the specific gamepad instances based on the event's context, such as a gamepad ID. 2. Making Gamepad Handle Methods Public - **Pros**: Allows direct event routing/subscribing to specific \`Gamepad\` instances. - **Cons**: Exposes \`Gamepad\` methods that aren't meant to be public, potentially leading to misuse or making the API harder to understand. Exposing internals purely for the convenience of event handling often indicates a design issue. It might solve the immediate problem but could introduce complexity or misuse of the class interface later. Suggested Approach: A Combination with Enhancements Considering encapsulation, maintainability, and the potential for future expansion or changes, you can combine aspects of both strategies while addressing their drawbacks. Here's an enhanced approach: **Create a Dedicated Gamepad Event Handling Method in the InputManager** - Instead of making all gamepad handle methods public or stuffing all logic into a massive \`Update\` method, consider implementing a dedicated method within the \`InputManager\` to handle gamepad events. This method can then dispatch the events to the appropriate \`Gamepad\` instance based on identifiers or other relevant event data. **Example Skeleton Code**: \`\`\`cpp void InputManager::HandleGamepadEvent(const GamepadEvent& event) { // Example of distinguishing events based on some ID or type within the event switch(event.type) { case GamepadEventType::ButtonPress: if (gamepads.find(event.gamepadID) != gamepads.end()) { gamepads[event.gamepadID].HandleButtonPress(event); } break; // Other case handlers for different event types } } \`\`\` And within your \`Gamepad\` class, ensure you have corresponding private or public (if necessary) methods that can be called by \`InputManager\`. These methods do not need to be exposed to other parts of the system outside of \`InputManager\`. **Subscription Logic**: - You subscribe to gamepad-related events in the \`InputManager\` since it's the central authority managing gamepad instances. This encapsulates gamepad event handling within a relevant context and allows flexibility for forwarding events to specific \`Gamepad\` instances. By following this approach, you maintain a clean separation of concerns, keeping your \`Gamepad\` class interfaces protected while centralizing event handling logic within the \`InputManager\`, which already bears the responsibility of managing these devices. This design supports scalability and adjustability, accommodating future changes with minimal impact on the overall architecture."},{"prompt":"But that means making the HandleButtonPress methods in the Gamepad public or friend class private, which I will have to make friend class with the input manager right? So in the end the inputmanager will receive the event and call the handle events in the gamepad, right?","completion":"That's correct, your understanding of the situation aligns with the typical considerations one has to weigh when designing an event-driven system, especially within the context of C++ where encapsulation and access control are important design considerations. Let's explore the options for maintaining encapsulation while allowing \`InputManager\` to communicate with \`Gamepad\` instances effectively: # Making \`HandleButtonPress\` Public - **Pros**: Straightforward, does not require friend classes or intricate designs. \`InputManager\` can directly call public methods of \`Gamepad\`. - **Cons**: Exposes the handling methods to any part of the code, potentially breaking the encapsulation. # Using Friend Classes - **Pros**: Keeps \`Gamepad\` handling methods non-public, allowing only \`InputManager\` to call them directly. - **Cons**: Tight coupling between \`InputManager\` and \`Gamepad\`. Use of friend classes can make the code harder to refactor and understand, as it creates a special relationship between the classes. Making \`HandleButtonPress\` and similar methods public offers the most straightforward approach but does breach the encapsulation principle somewhat since it opens up potentially sensitive methods to be accessible from any part of the system. Applying the friend class concept, where \`Gamepad\` declares \`InputManager\` as a friend, provides more controlled access but at the cost of tighter coupling and potential challenges in maintaining and understanding the codebase. # Recommended Approach: Encapsulate Gamepad Event Handling Logic Given these considerations, a balanced approach might involve encapsulating the gamepad event handling logic within methods that are part of the \`Gamepad\` class's public interface but are designed specifically for event handling. This way, you maintain clearer encapsulation without exposing low-level handling details: \`\`\`cpp class Gamepad { public: // Public event handling method - part of the interface void OnEvent(const GamepadEvent& event); private: void HandleButtonPress(/* parameters */); // Other private handling methods }; \`\`\` In \`Gamepad::OnEvent\`, you can switch based on the event type and call the appropriate private handler method. This method acts as a public entry point for all gamepad-related events, keeping the specific event handling implementations private but accessible via the public \`OnEvent\` method. \`\`\`cpp void Gamepad::OnEvent(const GamepadEvent& event) { switch (event.type) { // Call the appropriate private handler based on the event type case GamepadEventType::ButtonPress: HandleButtonPress(/* parameters derived from event */); break; // Other cases } } \`\`\` The \`InputManager\` would then call \`OnEvent\` on the relevant \`Gamepad\` instance, passing in the event: \`\`\`cpp void InputManager::HandleGamepadEvent(const GamepadEvent& event) { if (gamepads.find(event.gamepadID) != gamepads.end()) { gamepads[event.gamepadID].OnEvent(event); } } \`\`\` This approach effectively balances the necessity of keeping handling logic encapsulated within the \`Gamepad\` instances while providing a controlled pathway for events through a public \`OnEvent\` interface. It allows \`InputManager\` to remain in charge of routing events to the correct \`Gamepad\` instance without necessitating direct access to internal state or private handling methods. This maintains a cleaner separation of concerns, improves code readability, and retains the flexibility to modify internal handling logic without impacting external interactions."},{"prompt":"I don't have a type for my events, so we will have to dynamically check the object class they represent, my event class hierarchy is like this: class Event { friend class EventConverter; public: virtual ~Event() = default; protected: uint8_t priority; }; class GamepadButtonDownEvent : public GamepadButtonBaseEvent { public: GamepadButtonDownEvent(int gamepadID, Input::GamepadButton button); ~GamepadButtonDownEvent() override = default; }; class GamepadBaseEvent : public Event { public: virtual ~GamepadBaseEvent() override = default; int GetGamepadID() const; protected: GamepadBaseEvent(int gamepadID); int gamepadID; };","completion":"Given your event class hierarchy and the lack of a distinct event type field, to direct events to the appropriate handler methods in your design, you'll need to use a form of runtime type identification (RTTI), specifically dynamic casting in C++, to determine the specific derived type of an event object. This approach involves attempting to dynamically cast a base class pointer (\`Event*\`) to a derived class pointer (such as \`GamepadButtonDownEvent*\`) and checking if the cast is successful to identify the event's actual derived type. Upon successful identification, you can then route the event to the appropriate handling logic within your \`InputManager\` or \`Gamepad\` classes. Here's an outline on how you might approach dispatching such events within your \`InputManager\` class, specifically handling dynamically determining event types and calling the corresponding gamepad event handling method: # General Concept First, ensure that your base \`Event\` class and all derived event classes are polymorphic. This typically means having at least one virtual function (which you already have with the virtual destructor). # Implementing Event Dispatching in InputManager In the \`InputManager\`, you'd receive a generic \`Event\` pointer/reference, attempt to dynamically cast it to specific \`Event\` subclasses, and route the event to the corresponding \`Gamepad\` based on the gamepad ID. \`\`\`cpp void InputManager::DispatchEvent(const std::shared_ptr<Event>& event) { // Attempt to dynamically cast to a GamepadButtonDownEvent auto* gamepadButtonDownEvent = dynamic_cast<GamepadButtonDownEvent*>(event.get()); if (gamepadButtonDownEvent != nullptr) { // Get Gamepad ID and dispatch the event to the specific gamepad int gamepadID = gamepadButtonDownEvent->GetGamepadID(); if (gamepads.find(gamepadID) != gamepads.end()) { gamepads[gamepadID].OnButtonDown(gamepadButtonDownEvent->button); } return; } // Other dynamic_cast checks for different event types here... } \`\`\` This example uses \`dynamic_cast\` to discern the specific type of an event at runtime. Note that \`dynamic_cast\` can incur a performance penalty, especially if used frequently in a performance-critical loop. However, for event dispatching in a game engine, this is often an acceptable trade-off given the relatively low frequency of event processing compared to, say, per-frame calculations. # Recommendations 1. **Keep Type Checks to a Minimum**: Aim to minimize the places where you need to perform such dynamic type checks. Ideally, these checks should occur at \\"choke points\\" in your architecture, such as the main event dispatching logic, rather than scattered through your codebase. 2. **Consider Alternatives**: As your engine grows, if performance becomes a concern or if you find yourself adding many new event types, it might be worth exploring alternative designs. This could include integrating a type field into the \`Event\` class hierarchy or adopting a more sophisticated event handling system (e.g., Entity Component Systems (ECS) which can efficiently handle such cases through component-based designs). 3. **Performance**: Always profile your code to understand where your actual performance bottlenecks lie. Premature optimization can lead to increased complexity without substantial gains. Remember, while dynamic casting provides the flexibility to handle various event types through a generic interface, maintaining clear and efficient event routing logic is crucial as your project scales. Balancing flexibility, performance, and code maintainability is key to a successful game engine architecture."},{"prompt":"I think this will be a much verbose option that I just make them friends and make them couple-tightly. My InputManager already controls everything about the controls. Another alternative would be making the subscribe method inside each Gamepad constructor and use the GetGamepadID to check if match their own and use them, but I don't know if this is possible since they are objects inside a map of the InputManager and I don't know if I want to give them this much freedom.","completion":"Given your consideration and constraints, it's clear that finding a balance between architectural purity and practical implementation efficiency is key. Let's explore your alternative suggestion and its implications to see if it could be a viable path or if adjustments could be made to align it more closely with your goals. # Alternative Approach: Gamepad Self-Subscription In the alternative you propose, each \`Gamepad\` instance subscribes to events directly in its constructor and uses its \`gamepadID\` to determine if incoming events are relevant. This approach has the potential to decentralize event handling, making each \`Gamepad\` more autonomous. However, as you've identified, this autonomy could lead to a design where \`Gamepad\` instances have potentially excessive independence or where the lines of responsibility between the \`InputManager\` and the individual \`Gamepad\` instances become blurred. Let's dissect the feasibility and implications: Feasibility - **Technical Feasibility**: Subscribing within the \`Gamepad\` constructor is technically possible. Each \`Gamepad\` could register itself with the event system, possibly via a global event dispatcher, using a lambda or a member function adapter that filters events based on \`gamepadID\`. - **Design Considerations**: This design implies that \`Gamepad\` instances have enough context to make these event subscriptions effectively. It might necessitate \`Gamepad\` having access to global or singleton instances of the event dispatching system or being passed such references upon construction. Implications - **Decoupling**: This approach could lead to a decoupled design where \`Gamepad\` instances manage their event lifecycles independently. However, this decoupling could also mean less centralized control over event flow and handling within the \`InputManager\`, potentially complicating the debugging of event-related issues. - **Event Filtering**: Filtering based on \`gamepadID\` at each \`Gamepad\` instance can introduce redundancy, especially if many events are processed that don't pertain to most \`Gamepad\` instances. This could impact performance slightly, depending on the event rate and the number of \`Gamepad\` instances. - **Lifecycle Management**: There are implications for object lifecycle and event unsubscription. Ensuring that \`Gamepad\` instances unsubscribe from events upon destruction is critical to avoid dangling references or event handler invocations on destroyed objects. Considerations for Implementation If you choose to pursue this path, consider the following to mitigate some of the potential downsides: - **Centralized Dispatching with Delegation**: Maintain a model where \`InputManager\` performs initial event dispatching but delegates events to \`Gamepad\` instances based on \`gamepadID\`. This allows for a centralized entry point for event handling while keeping the specific processing logic within \`Gamepad\`. - **Explicit Unsubscription**: Ensure that your destructor or a specific teardown method for \`Gamepad\` handles unsubscribing from events cleanly to manage the object lifecycle properly. - **Event Dispatcher Access**: Manage how \`Gamepad\` instances access the event dispatching system. This might involve passing a reference to the dispatcher upon \`Gamepad\` construction or accessing a global/singleton instance, depending on your application's design principles. Given your concerns about tight coupling versus architectural freedom, striking a balance is crucial. Leveraging the \`InputManager\` to centrally manage key aspects of event handling while delegating specific logic to \`Gamepad\` instances, all the while ensuring clean subscription and unsubscription practices, could provide a structured yet flexible solution fitting your project's needs."},{"prompt":"I know what I will do, I will make a Attorney-Client pattern class, and I will expose the Handle Events functions of the Gamepad and make it friend class with InputManager, that way InputManager doesn't have the entire class as friend, and I can use their specific handle events that would be private in the gamepad class. So given this new approach, do you think this is better even thought it will be bloating the source more with more classes, or should I just make the Gamepad and InputManager friends directly so it can access the Handle event methods directly and privately?","completion":"The Attorney-Client pattern you're considering is a creative way to manage access control between \`InputManager\` and \`Gamepad\` while neatly sidestepping some of the drawbacks associated with making them full-fledged friends. This pattern enables \`InputManager\` to access only specific members of \`Gamepad\`, rather than its entire private interface, hence offering a more granular and controlled form of access. Here's a comparison to help decide between using the Attorney-Client pattern and making \`InputManager\` and \`Gamepad\` direct friends: # Direct Friendship - **Pros**: - Simplicity and straightforwardness in coding. - Easier to maintain in smaller projects or when the interaction between the classes is limited and well-defined. - **Cons**: - Tight coupling. \`InputManager\` has access to all private members of \`Gamepad\`, which can lead to maintenance issues as the project grows. - Less clear encapsulation and potentially a wider surface for bugs if the \`InputManager\` inadvertently modifies \`Gamepad\` state it shouldn't touch. # Attorney-Client Pattern - **Pros**: - Granular access. \`InputManager\` can only access parts of \`Gamepad\` explicitly allowed by the \\"Attorney\\", enhancing encapsulation. - Can serve as documentation. The existence of an \\"Attorney\\" class spells out the intended interaction between \`InputManager\` and \`Gamepad\`. - Reduces the potential for unintended interactions between the classes, making the codebase easier to maintain and refactor. - **Cons**: - Additional complexity. Requires the definition of an extra class (the \\"Attorney\\"), which can bloat the codebase slightly. - May lead to more boilerplate code, as you'll need to route interactions through the \\"Attorney\\" class. - Overhead in understanding the pattern for new team members or contributors not familiar with it. # Decision Considerations - **Project Scale**: For larger, complex projects, or when you anticipate significant future growth, the Attorney-Client pattern may offer a better way to manage complex interactions with more controlled access, aiding in maintenance and scalability. - **Team Familiarity**: If your development team is comfortable with design patterns and values the benefits of granular access control, the slight overhead of the Attorney-Client pattern could be considered a worthwhile investment. - **Encapsulation Importance**: If maintaining strict encapsulation boundaries is crucial for your project, the Attorney-Client pattern is the superior choice as it better encapsulates the behavior and responsibilities of \`Gamepad\` while still enabling necessary interactions. In summary, if you're aiming for a clean, maintainable, and scalable design—and the overhead of an additional class doesn't outweigh these benefits for your project—the Attorney-Client pattern represents a well-justified and structured approach to managing the relationship between \`InputManager\` and \`Gamepad\`. However, for smaller projects or scenarios where the relationship between these classes is unlikely to become complex, direct friendship might suffice and offer a simpler solution."},{"prompt":"I got another question for you, what if I want to deal with events that has an specific ID for the object, should I check that in the lamba in the subscribe call or in the handle method? 1) EventManager::GetInstance().Subscribe<WindowShownEvent>([this](std::shared_ptr<WindowShownEvent> event){ if (event->GetWindowID() == GetWindowID()) { this->HandleWindowShownEvent(event); } }); 2) void Window::HandleWindowShownEvent(std::shared_ptr<WindowShownEvent>event) { if (event->GetWindowID() == GetWindowID()) { visible = true; } }","completion":"Both approaches to handling events that are associated with a specific ID (such as window ID in your example) have their contexts where they might be more suitable, based on several factors including readability, separation of concerns, and performance implications. Let’s explore each approach: # Approach 1: Filtering in the Subscription Lambda Pros: - **Centralized Filtering**: Keeping the filtering logic close to the subscription logic allows for a clear overview of what events are intended for the subscriber. This can be particularly beneficial for maintaining a clean separation between event subscription/dispatch and event handling. - **Performance Optimization**: By filtering out irrelevant events at the earliest possible stage (before the actual handler is invoked), you can potentially save on unnecessary calls and operations for handlers that will just ignore the event after checking its ID. This can be more efficient, especially if the handler involves more complex logic beyond ID checking. - **Encapsulation**: By filtering at the subscription level, your \`HandleWindowShownEvent\` method only deals with events that are relevant, maintaining its focus on handling rather than filtering. Cons: - **Repetition**: If you subscribe to many such events, you might end up repeating similar filtering lambdas across your subscriptions. This could reduce code reusability and increase maintenance efforts. # Approach 2: Checking in the Handler Method Pros: - **Self-Contained Handling Logic**: Keeping the ID check inside the handler method encapsulates the entire response logic (checking and acting on the event) within a single location. This can make the handler self-sufficient and easy to understand in isolation. - **Reusability**: The handler method can be called directly with an event (for testing or from different contexts), and it will still correctly filter based on the ID, making it potentially more reusable. Cons: - **Potential Performance Overhead**: If the event dispatch system is highly active, sending numerous events of the same type to many handlers, performing the check inside the handler could lead to slight performance overhead. This is because the event system can't preemptively filter out irrelevant events, leading to more handler invocations. - **Mixing Concerns**: Mixing filtering logic with handling logic could be seen as blending different concerns within the same method, potentially complicating method responsibility. # Recommended Approach - For scenarios where **performance and efficient event routing** are critical, and especially when handling potentially high volumes of events, **Approach 1** might be preferable as it ensures that only relevant events trigger the handler logic. - In cases where **code clarity, encapsulation, and reusability** of the handler functions are more important, or when direct invocation of handlers (perhaps for testing) would benefit from embedded filtering, **Approach 2** can be more suitable. - **Readability and Maintainability**: If the filtering logic becomes complex, keeping it separate from the handling logic could help maintain readability. Conversely, simple checks might not justify the additional lambda layer, making in-handler checks more appealing. # Conclusion Choosing between these approaches depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application, as well as the expected volume and frequency of events. In many cases, adopting a hybrid approach where the decision is made on a case-by-case basis can provide the best balance between performance, clarity, and maintainability."},{"prompt":"Understood, I decided to go for the first approach, since I care more about efficiency than the other points, now another unrelated thing: Do you think I should store the windowID as a field in my Window class or the call to SDL_GetWindowID(window); function is negigible?","completion":"Storing the \`windowID\` as a field within your \`Window\` class versus frequently calling \`SDL_GetWindowID(window)\` to retrieve it when needed involves a trade-off between memory efficiency and potential computational overhead. However, for most practical purposes within the context of a desktop game or application development using SDL, the implications of either choice are minimal but can lean towards favoring improved efficiency and code clarity. # Reasons to Store \`windowID\` in Your Class: 1. **Performance Optimization**: While the performance cost of calling \`SDL_GetWindowID(window)\` is likely negligible in most scenarios, retrieving the \`windowID\` from a field in your class is inherently faster. This difference might be inconsequential in a small application but could become noticeable in a larger project with numerous windows or in scenarios where the window ID is accessed very frequently within performance-critical loops. 2. **Code Clarity and Convenience**: Having the \`windowID\` readily available as a field can improve code readability and convenience. It makes the ID immediately accessible wherever you have an instance of the \`Window\` class, without needing to make an additional function call each time you need it. 3. **Consistency**: Once retrieved and stored, the \`windowID\` for a window instance remains constant for the lifetime of that window. Storing it upon window creation ensures that you have consistent access to this identifier without needing to query the SDL library each time. # Considerations Against Storing \`windowID\`: 1. **Memory Overhead**: Storing the \`windowID\` in each instance of your \`Window\` class introduces a minimal amount of additional memory usage. However, given the small size of an integer field (which is what \`windowID\` is), this overhead is almost negligible in the context of modern desktop applications. 2. **Initial Retrieval**: If the \`windowID\` is only needed occasionally, retrieving and storing it when the \`Window\` instance is created (or first used) might be seen as unnecessary. However, this is a very minor consideration, as the process is straightforward and the cost of storing an integer is minimal. # Conclusion: Given these considerations, **storing the \`windowID\` as a field within your \`Window\` class is generally a good practice**. It enhances code performance by a small margin, improves the clarity and convenience of your code, and the cost in terms of additional memory usage is negligible. This approach aligns well with optimizing for efficiency and maintaining easily readable and maintainable code."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ scooby-doo transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Shaggy, Scooby, Daphne, Velma and Fred are ready for a skiing adventure, driving through a terrible snowstorm in the Mystery Machine. Low on gas, they stop in a small town named Winterhaven. They explore and find the town deserted and all of the shops are out of business, as well as the gas station. They knock on the doors of a ski lodge and meet Mayor Dudley. He explains that there's no power for heat or lights, the town is deserted because of a ghost called the 10,000 Volt Ghost that has been scaring the residents. He tells a haunting tale, a while back, when the town was thriving and popular, but a snowstorm occurred and the power line snapped loose. Voltner, an electrician climbed the tower to repair the power line and a small explosion occurred, overloading the circuit breakers and blew out all the transformers. Voltner's body was never found and then the 10,000 Volt Ghost appeared. Frightened, Shaggy and Scooby try to leave, but are unable to since they're still out of gas. The gang goes to the power plant to search for the ghost. The bars on the gate have been melted through, as if by extreme heat. They bump into the owner of the plant, Mr. Collins. He claims he is only one that didn't leave the town because of the ghost. The gang splits up to look for clues. Shaggy then decides to cook some hamburgers and succeeds when the frying pan starts heating up but it was all because of the 10,000 Volt Ghost's electricity. Scooby then tells Shaggy that the 10,000 Volt Ghost is right in front of them but Shaggy believes that he is cooking the burgers on a battery powered oven. Scooby then tells Shaggy again and then sees the 10,000 Volt Ghost, who appears to be a large body of electricity. He chases Scooby and Shaggy back to where Fred and the girls are, and the 10,000 Volt Ghost appears again and chases everyone. After they lose him, they find a clue: Sunflower seeds. Daphne notes she saw a pet shop on the way in. The gang splits up again, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby head to the pet shop, where they find a rubber suit and an underground tunnel leading from the pet shop to the power plant. Daphne and Fred go to Voltner's house which seems deserted. Daphne and Fred find a scrap of paper that reads: whereas running southwesterly 27 28 43 44 45. It means nothing at the moment, but Daphne and Fred are determined to find out. The gang heads to the library to find records on the numbers on the scrap of paper: 27 28 43 44 45. Velma gets the record book, but before they can look at the book, the 10,000 Volt Ghost pops up and chases the gang, trying to get the book. Shaggy and Scooby hide in a row of filing cabinets and finally make their way back to the gang. Fred sets up a trap in the power plant and it succeeds, catching the 10,000 Volt Ghost with an electric magnet. As Shaggy and Scooby pull the magnet on a snowmobile the ghost falls and rolls into a snowball. At the bottom of the hill the snow melts and shorts out the costume. The 10,000 Volt Ghost is unmasked as Voltner, who never disappeared. He wore an insulated rubber suit to protect himself from the electricity and he attached a battery pack to the suit. Voltner was also acting under Mayor Dudley's commands. Mayor Dudley wanted to exploit the land for more than what it was worth so he got Voltner to act as the ghost. The records book proved the mayor bought parcels 27 through 45 (just like in the latter) but a freeway was running through, so the land would be worth a fortune. So Voltner and the mayor conjured up the phony disappearing act. The pet shop was their hideout and the tunnel was used to sneak into the power plant and black out the town, causing people to believe it was the 10,000 Volt Ghost causing the trouble. Unfortunately, the bird seeds from the pet shop stuck to Voltner's shoes and gave the whole plan away. The crooked mayor (who tries to flee, but Scooby stops him by pinning the coattail with his paw) and Voltner are apprehended and presumably taken into custody. With the power restored to the town, the gang is getting ready to leave, but Scooby decides to go for one last ski run and goes crashing into a tree with two angry squirrels in it as Scooby says his catchphrase.","completion":"**[The scene sets with the Mystery Machine forcefully battling its way through a blizzard of cartoon proportions.

Outside, in the foggy night, a horseman rides by with a grinning pumpkin for a head! The mansion is the huge and studious Crane Manor, and Mystery Inc. has been invited by Mrs. Crane to the Halloween Party. Scooby Dum, Scooby's cousin, is also there with Mystery Inc. Fred, Daphne and Velma bob for apples and Shaggy and Scooby are hitting up the buffet table, as usual. Scooby, Shaggy and Scooby Dum encounter the Headless Horseman outside and run back inside to tell the others. Daphne, Fred and Velma are in the library with Mrs. Crane's niece, Beth. Beth mentions her great-great grandfather was Ichabod Crane. Scooby and Shaggy run in and tell their story, and Beth fears that the Headless Horseman has come back to haunt her family, considering her grandfather Ichabod was chased by one years earlier. Back on the party floor, the Headless Horseman makes an entrance causing havoc. He claims he wants a head and scares away the guests, but not Mystery Inc. The gang split up to look for clues. Velma, Scooby, Scooby-Dum, and Shaggy search upstairs. They start looking into rooms, but find nothing. Velma returns downstairs and Shaggy, Scooby and Scooby Dum run into the Headless Horseman who gives chase. Shaggy and the two cousins run downstairs to tell the gang, but when they all return upstairs, the Horseman is gone. Mrs. Crane is nearly grabbed by the Horseman and Mystery Inc. tries to comfort her, when a man appears and explains that the Horseman is not after her head, but is after Mrs. Crane's necklace. Beth says this is her cousin Elwood, who states that ever since Mrs. Crane brought the necklace into the house, the Horseman has been appearing. Elwood makes an exit and Daphne, Fred, Velma, Scooby, Shaggy, and Scooby Dum get to work. Elwood takes Mrs. Crane's necklace to the bank and then after his car disappears into the fog, the gang notices Headless Horseman ride by again, now with by Elwood's head! The gang finds Elwood's car deserted and finds a small picture of Elwood with glue on one side, the ignition keys missing, and a newspaper clipping that tells about a flying saucer spotted at a beautician's convention. They bump into Tarlof, Mrs. Crane's butler. He explains that someone chopped a tree down and it fell on the power lines cutting the power to the mansion, and he was walking to the neighbor's to complain. The gang go to where the Headless Horseman is supposedly buried. Fred and Velma figure it out and race to the airport. Sure enough, the Headless Horseman is there, about to take off in a plane. Scooby and Shaggy accidentally hop on the plane with the Horseman and manage to elude him as the plane soars through the air. Finally the plane wrecks and the Horseman is captured. The Headless Horseman turns out to be Cousin Elwood, who was after Mrs. Crane's diamond necklace all along, so he made up the Headless Horseman to trick Mrs. Crane into believing the necklace was cursed. The clues are explained as well; Elwood grabbed the missing keys out of habit when he left the car, and the picture was a passport photo for Elwood to fly out of the country. Also, Elwood was lying when he said he called the bank, because the butler said the phone lines were down. Shaggy found the biggest clue: on the other side of the clipping, it reads that APEX, Elwood's shoe company, had filed for bankruptcy, so he tried to steal the diamonds. Shaggy says it was the perfect crime, until the gang found the clues that made it all look fishy. Scooby Dum hears the word \\"clue\\" and start looking for more. Hearing a splash, Shaggy and Scooby Doo looks for Scooby Dum. Scooby Dum, coming out of the pond, says he found a clue. The clue is a fish, and the fish squirts water at Scooby Dum, causing everyone to laugh at this.","completion":"**[The scene opens with a spooky, over-the-top Halloween party at Crane Manor.

On the way, they stop at a magician's (Zarko), magic show. He invites Shaggy and Scooby up onto stage and \\"saws them in half\\" the old magic box trick. However, Shaggy and Scooby get so scared at this trick that they run while the other half runs the other way. Both halves of the box crash and the audience boos. Zarko gets mad at Scooby and Shaggy for ruining his act and they run away. The gang leaves and head for Uncle Shagworthy's castle. Upon arrival, they are greeted by a man named Clarence who says he is the caretaker and warns them away from the castle. He explains when Shagworthy bought the castle, the Curse of Camelot came along with it. The caretaker tells Mystery Inc. that the castle is haunted by Merlin the wizard and his evil slave, the Black Knight. He also tells them that Shagworthy has gone missing. Soon after, Merlin and the Black Knight appears, warns the kids away, and kidnaps the caretaker. The five sleuths enter the castle and begin looking for Shagworthy. They begin walking through the winding corridors. The Black Knight appears, and the gang runs into a secret room with a replica of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in it. All of a sudden, flying ghostly figures rise up from the knight statues and chase the gang. Shaggy and Scooby get caught by Merlin and the Knight and get hypnotized to dispose of Fred, Daphne and Velma. Meanwhile, Fred, Velma and Daphne hide in the library where they find signs of a struggle, and a red silk scarf. Shaggy and Scooby try dropping a chandelier on Fred and the girls but it backfires, and Fred, Daphne and Velma manage to get them out of their trance with Scooby Snacks. Scooby or Shaggy has no memory of the events. The gang keeps looking for Shagworthy through the spooky castle. They go down into the dungeon where they find Shagworthy chained up on the wall. Shagworthy explains that Merlin and the knight started appearing in the castle every night at 12:15. The gang is puzzled at the odd time, though they continue looking for clues. They go to the treasure room to find it has been ransacked. Before they can go any further, the flying ghost knights appear and chase Fred, Daphne and Velma. Scooby and Shaggy are pursued by the Knight and Merlin. They fool them by pretending to be corny salesman, and then hide in suits of armor. Fred, Daphne and Velma hide in the music room, where they hear the Knight approaching. They trap him, to find it was Scooby and Shaggy in the knight costume. The gang searches the tower and finds an electronic organ. Velma is starting to piece the puzzle together. Now, all they have to do is trap the wizard and his tin friend. Scooby and Shaggy act as bait, and lure the two ghosts to their trap, but it backfires and Scooby and Shaggy flee, but manage to trap Merlin and the Knight in a woven tapestry. Merlin is unmasked as Clarence the caretaker and the Knight is unmasked as a hired henchman. But Velma isn't so sure; as Fred pulls off a rubber mask to reveal the caretaker was a disguise; Zarko is the culprit! He disguised himself as the caretaker. Mystery Inc. explains it all. Their first clue was when the knight carried the caretaker off through a wall, revealed by Velma to be a common magician trick. The silk scarf was a common tool used by magicians for some tricks. All of the flying ghost knights were controlled by pushing keys on the organ; they were just magician illusions. Zarko wanted to scare everyone off so he could search for Shagworthy's jewels. Also, Shagworthy told them about Merlin appearing at 12:15. Zarko's show ended at midnight and it took 15 minutes to get to the castle. After the case is wrapped up, Shagworthy offers Scooby and Shaggy a banquet. He tells Fred, Daphne, and Velma that he keeps the jewels in the refrigerator which are inside the buckets.","completion":"**[The scene transitions to the Mystery Machine cruising down a leafy New England road, autumn leaves swirling around it.

Estos ejercicios mejorarán tu fuerza, resistencia, flexibilidad, equilibrio y agilidad sin necesidad de usar equipamiento adicional. Aquí tienes un plan que puedes adaptar a tus necesidades y nivel de forma física: # Calentamiento (5-10 min) - **Marcha en el sitio o saltos ligeros:** Comienza a elevar tu ritmo cardíaco de manera gradual. - **Círculos de brazos:** Para calentar hombros y brazos. - **Rotaciones de cadera y tobillos:** Para preparar tus articulaciones. # Rutina Principal 1. **Flexiones (Push-ups):** 3 series de 10-15 repeticiones. Fortalece pecho, hombros y tríceps. Si son muy difíciles al principio, puedes comenzar haciendo flexiones de rodilla. 2. **Sentadillas (Squats):** 3 series de 15-20 repeticiones. Mejora la fuerza de tus piernas y tu núcleo. Asegúrate de mantener la espalda recta y bajar hasta que tus muslos estén paralelos al suelo. 3. **Planchas (Planks):** 3 series, manteniendo la posición de 30 segundos a 1 minuto. Fortalece el core y mejora la resistencia muscular. 4. **Dominadas imaginarias (Inverted Rows, utilizando una barra si es posible o simulando el movimiento):** Si no tienes acceso a una barra, enfócate en ejercicios que imiten el movimiento, como acostarte boca abajo y practicar el movimiento de tirar, simulando la acción sin resistencia. 3 series de 8-12 repeticiones. 5. **Burpees:** 3 series de 8-10 repeticiones. Son excelentes para mejorar la resistencia cardiovascular y la fuerza explosiva. 6. **Estocadas (Lunges):** 3 series de 12-15 repeticiones por pierna. Buen ejercicio para piernas y equilibrio. 7. **Mountain Climbers:** 3 series de 30 segundos. Excelente para el core y la resistencia. 8. **Hip Thrusts (sin peso):** 3 series de 15-20 repeticiones. Excelente para fortalecer glúteos y hamstrings. # Enfriamiento y Estiramiento (5-10 min) - Enfócate en estiramientos estáticos para todos los grupos musculares principales. Mantén cada estiramiento por 20-30 segundos. # Consejos Adicionales - **Progresión:** A medida que te hagas más fuerte, aumenta el número de repeticiones, series, o reduce el tiempo de descanso entre series para seguir desafiando a tu cuerpo. - **Entrenamiento HIIT:** Incorpora sesiones de entrenamiento por intervalos de alta intensidad (HIIT) para mejorar tu resistencia cardiovascular. - **Defensa personal y técnicas de caída:** Además de tu entrenamiento físico, considera aprender técnicas básicas de defensa personal y cómo caer de manera segura para minimizar lesiones. - **Consistencia:** Lo más importante es ser consistente con tu entrenamiento. Intenta hacer ejercicio al menos 3-4 veces por semana. Mantén una dieta equilibrada y asegúrate de descansar lo suficiente para recuperarte adecuadamente. La preparación física es crucial, pero la mentalidad y la capacidad de mantener la calma bajo presión también son importantes para desempeñarte eficazmente en situaciones de seguridad."},{"prompt":"¿Dominadas imaginarias? Dime cómo hago eso específicamente.","completion":"Mis disculpas por la confusión anterior. La referencia a \\"dominadas imaginarias\\" fue incorrecta en el contexto de entrenar sin equipo, ya que no se pueden realizar dominadas sin una barra o algún tipo de soporte. No obstante, si la intención es fortalecer los músculos implicados en las dominadas sin acceso a una barra, existen alternativas que puedes hacer. Lo correcto sería enfocarnos en ejercicios que ejerciten la espalda y los bíceps, que son los principales músculos trabajados en las dominadas. Aquí te dejo algunas opciones que puedes intentar: # 1. Superman - **Cómo se hace:** Acuéstate boca abajo en el suelo, estira los brazos hacia adelante y las piernas hacia atrás. Levanta simultáneamente los brazos y piernas del suelo, manteniendo tu mirada hacia abajo para no tensar el cuello. Esta posición imita la fase inicial de la dominada trabajando la parte superior de la espalda. Mantén la posición unos segundos y vuelve a la posición inicial. - **Series y repeticiones:** 3 series de 10-15 repeticiones. # 2. Remo con Toalla (en puerta) Este ejercicio requiere de una toalla y una puerta, así que técnicamente sigue siendo sin equipo fijo o especializado. - **Cómo se hace:** Anuda una toalla alrededor del pomo de una puerta cerrada para asegurarte de que sea segura. Toma el otro extremo con ambas manos y aleja tus pies de la puerta para crear tensión. Desde esta posición, tira de tu cuerpo hacia la puerta manteniendo el cuerpo recto, luego regresa al inicio de manera controlada. - **Series y repeticiones:** 3 series de 8-12 repeticiones. # 3. Bird Dog - **Cómo se hace:** Colócate a cuatro patas con las manos debajo de los hombros y las rodillas debajo de las caderas. Extiende un brazo hacia delante, mientras extiendes y levantas la pierna opuesta. Mantén un momento y cambia al otro lado. Esto fortalecerá tu núcleo y espalda baja, complementando el trabajo de los músculos de la espalda. - **Series y repeticiones:** 3 series de 10-15 repeticiones por lado. # 4. Puente de espalda o \\"Back Bridge\\" - **Cómo se hace:** Acuéstate boca arriba, flexiona las rodillas y coloca los pies en el suelo cerca de tus glúteos. Coloca las manos detrás de tu cabeza con los dedos apuntando hacia los hombros. Empuja a través de tus pies y manos para elevar el cuerpo hacia un puente. Es un ejercicio avanzado que fortalece la espalda pero debe hacerse con cuidado para evitar lesiones. - **Series y repeticiones:** 2-3 series de 5-10 segundos según tu capacidad. # 5. Flexiones en T - **Cómo se hace:** Realiza una flexión estándar, pero al subir, gira tu cuerpo hacia un lado levantando un brazo hacia el techo, volviendo a la posición de flexión y repitiendo hacia el otro lado. Esto añade un trabajo rotacional y de la parte superior de la espalda. - **Series y repeticiones:** 3 series de 8-12 repeticiones (cada lado). Estos ejercicios son alternativas viables para trabajar la espalda y los músculos relacionados sin necesidad de una barra de dominadas, y pueden ayudarte a construir la fuerza necesaria para, eventualmente, realizar dominadas cuando tengas acceso a una barra."},{"prompt":"¿Por qué has dicho lo de las dominadas negativas? ¿Como hacerlas exactamente?","completion":"Mis disculpas por cualquier confusión anterior. Si bien en la última comunicación no me referí específicamente a las dominadas negativas, ciertamente son una excelente herramienta para construir la fuerza necesaria para realizar dominadas completas, especialmente si estás tratando de mejorar en este ejercicio. Las dominadas negativas se enfocan en la fase excéntrica (de bajada) de las dominadas, un método eficaz para construir fuerza muscular. A continuación, te explico cómo realizarlas correctamente. # Cómo Hacer Dominadas Negativas: 1. **Necesitarás acceso a una barra de dominadas.** Aunque el enfoque era ejercicios sin equipo, en este caso, para realizar dominadas negativas, el uso de una barra es indispensable. Asegúrate de que la barra esté firmemente instalada y sea segura. 2. **Posición inicial:** Usa una caja, banco o salta para subir, de modo que puedas comenzar en la posición de arriba de la dominada, con la barbilla por encima de la barra. Tus manos deben estar separadas a la anchura de los hombros (o un poco más, según preferencia) con el agarre que elijas (palmas hacia ti o palmas lejos de ti). 3. **La fase negativa:** Desde la posición de arriba, comienza a bajar tu cuerpo lentamente hacia el suelo. La idea es controlar el movimiento descendente tanto como sea posible. Intente alargar esta fase tanto como sea posible, idealmente entre 5 a 10 segundos desde la posición superior hasta que tus brazos estén extendidos completamente. 4. **Regresar a la posición de inicio:** Una vez que hayas descendido completamente, puedes bajar de la barra, usar la caja o banco para volver a la posición de inicio, o saltar suavemente para colocarte de nuevo en la posición de arriba. 5. **Repetir:** Realiza varias repeticiones de este movimiento, según tu nivel de condición física. Si estás comenzando, incluso unas pocas repeticiones de calidad son beneficiosas. Con el tiempo, puedes aumentar el número de repeticiones. # Puntos Clave: - **Control:** El foco debe estar en el control del movimiento, no en la cantidad de repeticiones. La fase de descendimiento lento y controlado es lo que realmente ayuda a construir la fuerza. - **Frecuencia:** Puedes incorporar dominadas negativas en tu rutina de entrenamiento 2-3 veces por semana, permitiendo tiempo adecuado para la recuperación muscular. - **Progresión:** A medida que ganes fuerza, verás mejoras no solo en tu capacidad para hacer dominadas negativas más lentas y controladas, sino también en tu habilidad general para realizar dominadas completas. Las dominadas negativas son una estrategia efectiva especialmente para aquellos que se encuentran en las etapas iniciales de su entrenamiento de dominadas, ya que preparan el cuerpo para manejar su propio peso en el rango completo de movimiento del ejercicio. Esta técnica es beneficioso no solo para aspirantes a vigilantes de seguridad, sino para cualquiera que busque mejorar su fuerza de la parte superior del cuerpo."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These had left deep scars on the city, physically, economically, and socially. Here are some aspects that characterized Newark during 1974: # Economic Decline Newark had been an industrial powerhouse in the first half of the 20th century. However, by 1974, the city was facing significant economic challenges. Many factories had closed or moved to the suburbs or other regions, leading to a sharp rise in unemployment. The city's economic base, once strong in manufacturing, was dwindling, and few new industries were coming in to replace the lost jobs. # Urban Decay The physical landscape of Newark in 1974 was marked by urban decay. The 1967 riots, along with economic decline, had led to significant disinvestment in the city. This was visible in the form of abandoned buildings, neglected infrastructure, and a general sense of deterioration in many neighborhoods. Urban renewal projects, often involving the demolition of existing structures, sometimes made the situation more stark rather than revitalizing affected areas. # Racial Tensions Newark was a city marked by racial tensions and segregation. The 1967 riots were a response to decades of inequality, and the underlying issues of racial injustice and economic disparity had not been fully addressed by 1974. African American and Puerto Rican communities, in particular, were grappling with poor living conditions, inadequate schooling, and high rates of unemployment. # Political Landscape The city’s political landscape was in a period of transition, with increasing political activism among its African American population. Kenneth A. Gibson was elected as the first African American mayor of Newark in 1970, symbolizing a shift towards greater representation for the city's black community. His administration was faced with the daunting task of addressing the many problems that plagued the city, from attracting investment to tackling crime rates. # Social and Cultural Life Despite the difficulties, Newark maintained vibrant social and cultural scenes, especially within its diverse communities. The city was home to various cultural institutions, clubs, and restaurants that reflected its ethnic diversity, including strong African American, Latino, and Portuguese communities. Music, particularly jazz, had a stronghold in Newark, with clubs that attracted talents and audiences both locally and beyond. # Conclusion In 1974, Newark was a city facing significant challenges, from economic decline and urban decay to racial tensions. However, it was also a city of resilience, with communities striving for improvement and change amidst adversity. The period would set the stage for gradual transformations in subsequent decades, as Newark strived to rebuild and redefine itself."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The area was defined by high levels of poverty, crime, and a significant process of urban decay. The population of the South Bronx during this time was diverse, but it was also facing various struggles that were reflective of larger issues in New York City and urban America. Given this backdrop, the types of people you might find in the South Bronx during 1974 would have been a mix of various communities and individuals coping with the difficulties of their surroundings. Here are some of the groups and individuals you might have encountered: 1. **Residents of Hispanic/Latino Descent**: The South Bronx saw a significant population of Puerto Rican residents during the 1970s, making up a large portion of the community. There were also individuals from other Hispanic and Latino backgrounds. 2. **African American Community**: African Americans comprised another substantial portion of the population. Both African American and Latino communities were often living in densely populated and under-resourced neighborhoods. 3. **Immigrant Populations**: Beyond the sizable Puerto Rican community, the South Bronx was also home to immigrants from various other countries, each contributing to the multicultural makeup of the area. 4. **Artists and Musicians**: Despite, or perhaps because of, the economic hardship and urban decay, the South Bronx was a cradle for cultural and artistic movements, most notably the birthplace of hip hop. Pioneering DJs, MCs, breakdancers, and graffiti artists were beginning to lay the groundwork for what would become a global cultural movement. 5. **Activists and Community Leaders**: Faced with neglect from city officials and rampant disinvestment, local activists, and community leaders worked tirelessly to advocate for better living conditions, services, and opportunities for their neighborhoods. 6. **Youth and Gang Members**: The economic and social conditions of the time led to the formation of numerous street gangs. While some engaged in violent activities, others played a part in the community, even contributing to the peace and truce movements that would later influence the hip hop culture. 7. **Working-class Families**: Despite the economic challenges, many residents were working-class families striving to make ends meet. They worked in various sectors, often facing long hours and low pay. 8. **Small Business Owners**: Amidst the challenges, there were individuals who managed to operate small businesses in the community, providing essential goods and services. 9. **Victims of Urban Decay and Displacement**: Large numbers of residents were affected by widespread urban decay, with many living in substandard housing conditions. The era marked significant displacement due to both the physical collapse of buildings and policies that encouraged the demolition of \\"blighted\\" areas. 10. **Outsiders and Observers**: Social workers, journalists, photographers, and curious individuals visited the South Bronx, each with their own motivations. Some were there to provide assistance and bring attention to the crises, while others were drawn by the burgeoning cultural scenes. The South Bronx during 1974 was a study in contrasts, with immense challenges coexisting with vibrant cultural expressions. The resilience and creativity of its residents in the face of adversity have left an indelible mark on the cultural and social fabric of New York City."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Aquí tienes unas opciones efectivas: 1. **Superman**: - Túmbate boca abajo en el suelo, brazos y piernas extendidas. - Levanta simultáneamente brazos, piernas y pecho del suelo. - Mantén la posición unos segundos y baja lentamente. - Realiza 3 series de 10-15 repeticiones. 2. **Lagartijas/Push-Ups en T**: - Realiza una lagartija tradicional pero, al subir, gira el cuerpo hacia un lado elevando un brazo hacia el techo, extendiéndolo completamente y formando una \\"T\\" con tu cuerpo. - Retorna a la posición inicial y repite hacia el otro lado. - Este ejercicio trabaja tu pecho, pero la rotación y estabilización activan también la espalda. Realiza 3 series de 8-10 repeticiones por lado. 3. **Elevación de Caderas en Puente (Bridge Lifts)**: - Túmbate boca arriba, rodillas dobladas y pies planos en el suelo. - Levanta la cadera hacia el techo, apretando los glúteos y manteniendo el cuerpo recto desde los hombros hasta las rodillas. - Para una variante que involucre más la espalda superior, intenta entrelazar tus manos debajo de tu pelvis elevada y presiona los hombros contra el suelo. - Realiza 3 series de 15-20 repeticiones. 4. **'Renegade Rows' sin Pesas**: - Colócate en posición de plancha alta con las manos directamente debajo de los hombros. - Manteniendo el cuerpo recto y activando el core, realiza una 'remada' levantando un brazo hacia el lado de la cintura, manteniendo el codo cerca del cuerpo. - Baja el brazo y repite con el otro lado. - Aunque este ejercicio es más efectivo con pesas, realizarlo sin pesas puede ayudar a activar los músculos de la espalda. Realiza 3 series de 10-12 repeticiones por lado. Recuerda que la consistencia es clave en cualquier entrenamiento.

However, there are a few adjustments and considerations needed to ensure it functions as expected: 1. **Handling Individual Likes**: Your current implementation toggles the \`isLiked\` state for all feeds since it's a shared state. You might consider structuring this state to handle likes per feed to reflect individual interactions. 2. **Updating Feeds After Like**: After liking a feed, it's crucial to update your feed list to reflect the new state or refetch the feeds to show updated likes if that's not done. 3. **Error Handling Improvement**: You've used console logs for errors which is fine for debugging but consider user feedback for production code. 4. **Optimistic UI Updates**: (Optional) For better user experience, handle UI state changes optimistically when liking a feed before confirming changes on the backend. 5. **Use of \`.finally\`**: (Optional) To ensure \`setLoading(false)\` is called in every case, consider using \`.finally\`. 6. **Feed ID for Likes**: Ensure the \`feed.id\` passed to \`likeFeed\` correctly matches the expectation from your database schema.

The feed fetching operation (\`getFeeds\`) is logging \\"feeds undefined\\", which suggests a misunderstanding in how promises work with \`async\` functions. Your \`getFeeds\` function doesn't explicitly return a value, so when you log its result, you'll get \`undefined\`. This isn't indicative of an error in fetching the feeds; rather, it's just how you're trying to log the result. The actual fetching and state updating should still work if your \`supabase\` setup is correct. 2. When trying to like a feed, if you're getting an error or it's not working as expected, there could be a few reasons. Ensure that the \`id\` being passed to \`likeFeed\` matches an existing feed ID in your database. Also, the \`.update({likes: true})\` operation should accurately reflect your database schema—if \\"likes\\" is supposed to be a boolean, that should work, but if it's supposed to be a counter or requires a more complex operation (e.g., toggling), you'll need to adjust the logic accordingly. Here are some improvements and clarifications: **Addressing the 'feeds undefined' Logging Issue:** Since \`getFeeds\` doesn't return anything (it sets the state directly), trying to log its result will always give you \`undefined\`. Update the logging or remove it: \`\`\`jsx useEffect(() => { getFeeds(); // You don't need to log here as getFeeds doesn't return anything. }, []); \`\`\` **Improving the Like Functionality:** We'll assume you want to toggle the like status, and that each feed has an integer ID, a \`likes\` boolean to show if a feed is liked or not. You might need to adjust this logic based on your actual database schema: \`\`\`jsx const likeFeed = async (id) => { const feed = feeds.find(feed => feed.id === id); if (!feed) { console.error(\\"Feed not found!\\"); return; } const newLikesStatus = !feed.likes; try { const { error } = await supabase .from(\\"feeds\\") .update({likes: newLikesStatus}) .match({id}); if (error) throw error; // Optimistically update UI setFeeds(feeds.map(f => f.id === id ? { ...f, likes: newLikesStatus } : f)); } catch (error) { console.error(\\"error\\", error); } } \`\`\` **Ensuring Correct State Update:** This approach directly updates the \`feeds\` state with the new likes status for the specific feed. Note that this example optimistically updates the UI before the database operation is confirmed successful. Depending on your application's requirements, you might instead want to fetch the feeds anew after liking to ensure the UI is in sync with the database state, especially if likes are counted or have more complex logic on the backend."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

On the way, they stop at a magician's (Zarko), magic show. He invites Shaggy and Scooby up onto stage and \\"saws them in half\\" the old magic box trick. However, Shaggy and Scooby get so scared at this trick that they run while the other half runs the other way. Both halves of the box crash and the audience boos. Zarko gets mad at Scooby and Shaggy for ruining his act and they run away. The gang leaves and head for Uncle Shagworthy's castle. Upon arrival, they are greeted by a man named Clarence who says he is the caretaker and warns them away from the castle. He explains when Shagworthy bought the castle, the Curse of Camelot came along with it. The caretaker tells Mystery Inc. that the castle is haunted by Merlin the wizard and his evil slave, the Black Knight. He also tells them that Shagworthy has gone missing. Soon after, Merlin and the Black Knight appears, warns the kids away, and kidnaps the caretaker. The five sleuths enter the castle and begin looking for Shagworthy. They begin walking through the winding corridors. The Black Knight appears, and the gang runs into a secret room with a replica of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in it. All of a sudden, flying ghostly figures rise up from the knight statues and chase the gang. Shaggy and Scooby get caught by Merlin and the Knight and get hypnotized to dispose of Fred, Daphne and Velma. Meanwhile, Fred, Velma and Daphne hide in the library where they find signs of a struggle, and a red silk scarf. Shaggy and Scooby try dropping a chandelier on Fred and the girls but it backfires, and Fred, Daphne and Velma manage to get them out of their trance with Scooby Snacks. Scooby or Shaggy has no memory of the events. The gang keeps looking for Shagworthy through the spooky castle. They go down into the dungeon where they find Shagworthy chained up on the wall. Shagworthy explains that Merlin and the knight started appearing in the castle every night at 12:15. The gang is puzzled at the odd time, though they continue looking for clues. They go to the treasure room to find it has been ransacked. Before they can go any further, the flying ghost knights appear and chase Fred, Daphne and Velma. Scooby and Shaggy are pursued by the Knight and Merlin. They fool them by pretending to be corny salesman, and then hide in suits of armor. Fred, Daphne and Velma hide in the music room, where they hear the Knight approaching. They trap him, to find it was Scooby and Shaggy in the knight costume. The gang searches the tower and finds an electronic organ. Velma is starting to piece the puzzle together. Now, all they have to do is trap the wizard and his tin friend. Scooby and Shaggy act as bait, and lure the two ghosts to their trap, but it backfires and Scooby and Shaggy flee, but manage to trap Merlin and the Knight in a woven tapestry. Merlin is unmasked as Clarence the caretaker and the Knight is unmasked as a hired henchman. But Velma isn't so sure; as Fred pulls off a rubber mask to reveal the caretaker was a disguise; Zarko is the culprit! He disguised himself as the caretaker. Mystery Inc. explains it all. Their first clue was when the knight carried the caretaker off through a wall, revealed by Velma to be a common magician trick. The silk scarf was a common tool used by magicians for some tricks. All of the flying ghost knights were controlled by pushing keys on the organ; they were just magician illusions. Zarko wanted to scare everyone off so he could search for Shagworthy's jewels. Also, Shagworthy told them about Merlin appearing at 12:15. Zarko's show ended at midnight and it took 15 minutes to get to the castle. After the case is wrapped up, Shagworthy offers Scooby and Shaggy a banquet. He tells Fred, Daphne, and Velma that he keeps the jewels in the refrigerator which are inside the buckets.","completion":"**INT. CASTLE OF CURSES - NIGHT** In the eerie, cobweb-covered corridors of Uncle Shagworthy’s castle, the gang walks into what promises to be yet another perfectly normal, uneventful evening. (Yeah, right.) **FRED** Alright, gang, let's split up and look for clues. And by clues I mean a way out of here so we can go get some pizza. **DAPHNE** And I'm looking for a mirror. Walking through spiderwebs is not the new facial I signed up for. They stumble into a secret room, which houses an exact replica of the Knights of the Round Table. **VELMA** Jinkies! It looks like King Arthur left his knights here. And their fashion sense. Suddenly, ghostly figures begin to rise, causing the gang to scatter faster than when the last pizza slice is up for grabs. **SHAGGY** Zoinks! Like, I didn't know we RSVP'd to a ghost party, Scoob! **SCOOBY** Ruh-roh! Me neither! In their panic, Shaggy and Scooby are cornered and hypnotized by Merlin and the Black Knight. Moments later, they find themselves attempting a home renovation with a medieval flair—dropping a chandelier on their friends. **SCOOBY** (under hypnosis) Rorry, Red! **FRED** Not the interior decorating help I had in mind, guys! A Scooby Snack intervention breaks the spell, proving once again the treat's unparalleled power over supernatural mind control. Meanwhile, down in the dungeon... **SHAGWORTHY** Please, find Merlin before he messes with my Netflix recommendations again! As the search continues, Scooby and Shaggy, in a stroke of genius or perhaps sheer accident, disguise themselves as the least convincing salesmen in history, trying to sell medieval armor polish to the Knight and Merlin. **SHAGGY** You’ll be the bell of the brawl with this shine, man! **MERLIN** Begone, peasants! Your business model lacks a... magical touch. Back with Fred, Daphne, and Velma, they stumble upon the music room. Velma starts piecing the puzzle together, her brain working faster than Shaggy and Scooby in a pie-eating contest. **VELMA** Something’s off. There’s no way Merlin could’ve been into jazz fusion. This organ is our key... literally! With a less-than-perfect plan in motion, Scooby and Shaggy lure Merlin and the Knight into a trap. In classic fashion, it falls apart faster than their diet plans—but they heroically end up trapping the villains in a woven tapestry instead. **SHAGGY** Like, we meant to do that... right, Scoob? **SCOOBY** R-hehe, roh yeah! After some mask-pulling, villain unmasking, and a plot twist that surprises absolutely no one, it turns out Zarko, the magician with the flair for the dramatic, is behind it all. His motivation? Shagworthy’s jewels, and a perhaps a side of vengeance for that dreadful night at the magic show. **ZARKO** Curse you, meddling kids, and your dog, too! You've seen through my illusions! **VELMA** And we would’ve seen through them faster if it weren’t for, well... (glances at Shaggy and Scooby) all of... *this*. As things wrap up, Uncle Shagworthy reveals the jewels’ true hiding spot in a moment of comedic brilliance, proving that sometimes the best security is where you least expect it—next to the leftover lasagna. **SHAGWORTHY** Ah, the beauty of fooling burglars with the ol' bait and switch! **SHAGGY** Like, speaking of bait, is it time for that banquet? Scoob and I have built up quite an appetite! **SCOOBY** Rhehehe! Ri can't rait! As the banquet unfolds, Scooby and Shaggy realize they've bitten off more than they can chew—a table filled with every imaginable food, except for Scooby Snacks. **SCOOBY** Ruh-roh! Cue a collective groan from the gang, followed by uproarious laughter, as they dive into the feast, wondering what other mysteries might lie ahead—or maybe just where they're going to get Scooby Snacks at this hour. **END**"},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ scooby-doo transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma are driving down a dark road on a stormy night, on the way back from Niagara Falls. Soon, they realize they are lost. They run into a Canadian border patrol officer, Officer Oldfield, who warns them to not drive past the sanitarium, which is rumored to be haunted by the Ghost of Dr. Coffin. The gang continue to drive, but thanks to the sign being struck by lighting and it pointing the wrong way, they take the wrong road-towards the haunted sanitarium. They follow an ambulance all the way to the Shady Sanitarium. There, they witness paramedics carrying a patient inside, and Velma thinks that it's strange that they're doing this in a storm and at night. They get out of the van and are chased by guard dogs. But moments later the dogs just wander off like puppies. The man inside the sanitarium, Dr. Tooksbury invites them in to dinner. He claims that the dogs can be tamed by different kinds of music, that's why they wandered off. Dr. Tooksbury tells the gang that he was Dr. Coffin's assistant and that his patients keep disappearing. Mystery Inc. decides to spend the night. Fred, Shaggy and Scooby in one room, and Velma and Daphne in another. The boys see Dr. Coffin outside their window and Scooby finds a secret passage into a room containing a giant mirror. Shaggy hits a switch and the roof slides open, revealing the moon which shines down and reflects off the mirror. It is a solar furnace, and Fred doesn't know why it is in the sanitarium. Dr. Coffin appears again in the mirror and Fred, Shaggy and Scooby flee. Velma and Daphne witness paramedics carrying another patient into the hospital. The patient does not look like he's alive anymore. The whole gang follows the ambulance as it drives away-right to a deep chasm, only for it to vanished all of a sudden, Dr. Coffin appears on a cliff and laughs maniacally and then disappears. They decide to get some sleep and try to solve it in the morning. Back at the sanitarium, in the middle of the night, the mad doctor begins playing the organ putting Scooby in a trance. The gang wakes up and goes to the organ room, where they wake Scooby up and get chased by the guard dogs - right into a room full of wigs, which is their second clue. The gang splits up to look for clues, and Shaggy and Scooby find the mad doctor's laboratory. Dr. Coffin appears and chases them around the sanitarium. Fred, Daphne and Velma find the morgue, where they discover the \\"patients\\" they have been seeing are just piles of gold bars on a gurney with wigs poking out from under the sheet to make it appear to be people. The paramedics have been smuggling gold out in and out from the sanitarium. Then, Scooby and Shaggy run in with Dr. Coffin behind him. They hide under a blanket on a gurney and Dr. Coffin and his two henchmen take Scooby and Shaggy, load them on the ambulance, and drive away! Fred, Daphne and Velma follow the ambulance to a mine full with gold and a machine that wraps the gold in bread wrappers. Scooby and Shaggy escape and are chased in rail cars, but Dr. Coffin and his henchmen fall into the machine and get wrapped up. Dr. Coffin is unmasked as... Officer Oldfield! The border patrol officer. The man posing as Officer Oldfield was the ringleader of a gold smuggling operation. He used the ghost of Dr. Coffin and the guard dogs to scare people away. They put human-shaped casts of gold on gurneys with the wigs and loaded them on ambulances to drive the gold across the border, and the authorities would think they were just patients. Then they would mold the gold into bars with the solar furnace and smuggle it across the border into the U.S. Soon after the gang pack up, during which Scooby dances with Daphne, causing him to be called \\"A real Fred Astaire\\", but he runs away when Cuddles and Shoonkums (the guard dogs) show up behind him and invite him to dance with them.","completion":"**INT.

Lightning strikes a road sign, twirling it like a game show wheel of misfortune, pointing the gang towards the Sanitarium. **CUT TO: EXTERIOR - SANITARIUM** The sanitarium looms like a college dorm after finals week—creepy, with the faint smell of mystery... and maybe microwaved nachos. Enter Officer Oldfield, Canadian Border Patrol, stepping out with the enthusiasm of a man who's seen too many reruns of haunting documentaries. **OFFICER OLDFIELD** Eh, don't you know about the Ghost of Dr. Coffin? Folks around here say he's haunting the place, don't cha know. **DAPHNE** A ghost? Well, that sure beats the haunted vending machine at the last hotel we stayed. **FRED** Thanks, Officer.

Interesting. Their dedication to healthcare is... *shockingly* good. **DAPHNE** Or shockingly *bad*, considering they're just smuggling gold bars in wigs. Talk about a golden perm! **INT.

Scooby witnesses this and tells the gang, who then informed the police about what Scooby saw, but the lieutenant is skeptical. The coin shop owner claims that the burglar stole the Golden Galleon, a supposedly cursed valuable, so Mystery Inc. get to work and begin following the \\"No-Face Zombie\\". They follow him to the Dilly Dally Dolly Co., where they are greeted by a night watchman, who scolds them and tells them to leave. So they set up a plan to enter through an open window. Scooby is catapulted inside, then Fred and Shaggy are lifted up with a crate on a forklift, but a car pulls up, forcing Velma and Daphne to hide in the crate. One of the men from the car drives the forklift into a garage and Velma and Daphne become trapped in the crate. Fred, Scooby and Shaggy hurry to the garage and freed them just before running into the two men who are the owners of the factory, Mr. Dilly and Mr. Dally. After hearing the gang's story, Mr. Dilly and Mr. Dally instructs them to stay in the office while they search for the zombie. Mr. Dilly and the watchman begin searching and Mr. Dally is grabbed by the No-Face Zombie. Inside the office, Velma finds a magazine with three pages torn out, their first clue. Then, the No-Face Zombie attacks Scooby and the gang, but they manage to swipe the Golden Galleon and flee from the zombie. When they make a run for it, they discover another villain-a giant gorilla is now after the gang! Scooby and Shaggy run into the cafeteria and have a run-in with the popcorn machine. After they've escaped the goons, they phone the police and he tells them they will have to wait there to wait for the lieutenant to arrive. The gorilla and the zombie make an appearance again and chases them all. In the process, the zombie swipes the galleon. They are chased around some more, and while running, Scooby tumbles into a duplication machine and gets multiplied. After being found in a room full of multiple dogs, Scooby joins Shaggy outside to find a newsstand and get another copy of the magazine that Velma found, to see which pages were torn out. But the gorilla appears and chases them back to the factory. Meanwhile, Velma, Fred and Daphne manage to steal the coin back from the zombie. The lieutenant, Scooby and Shaggy arrive at the factory and run into Fred and the girls. But the zombie appears and takes the golden galleon again. After a short chase, they crash into the zombie and discover that it was a computerized robot. The gorilla appears and swipes the coin, and tries to make a getaway, but Shaggy and Scooby act fast and trap him. The gorilla is unmasked as Mr. Dilly. He read about the coin article in that magazine and programmed that robot to steal the coin because it was worth a million dollars. Then when the gang was onto him, he donned the gorilla costume to scare them off, and had Mr. Dally and the night watchman locked in the storeroom. As a reward, Mr. Dally opens up the factory cafeteria. However, when Shaggy and Scooby order some burgers, Dally reveals they're all gone as the duplicates of Scooby ate them all.","completion":"**INT. SANDWICH SHOP - NIGHT** The gang is wolfing down sandwiches like they’ve crash-landed from a planet starving for lettuce and cold cuts. The calm is shattered by Scooby, who starts theatrically miming a robbery, adding a flair worthy of a silent film star. **SCOBBY** Ruh-roh! (Mimes a figure in a cloak, then pretends to steal invisible coins, quite the mime artist) **FRED** Did someone spike Scooby's water bowl with espresso again? Scooby drags them outside just in time to see the \\"No-Face Zombie\\" make his get-away, with dramatic cloak billowing in the night wind. **CUT TO: DILLY DALLY DOLLY CO. - LATER** They lay eyes on the factory, a building so nondescript it could win an award for \\"Most Likely to Be Forgotten.\\" Plans are quickly hatched to infiltrate the building. Chaos ensues as Scooby is launched through the air with less grace than a turkey on Thanksgiving. **FRED** On three. One... two— **SCOOBY** Rikes! Scooby is catapulted through the window, creating an entrance with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. **INSIDE THE DILLY DALLY DOLLY CO.** Amidst clattering and calamity, Velma and Daphne unwittingly take a ride in the crate, their expressions a mix of disbelief and mild annoyance typically reserved for when they run out of gas in the middle of nowhere. **VELMA** Well, this is certainly a \\"boxed lunch\\" scenario. **MR. DILLY AND MR. DALLY** Encounter with Mr. Dilly and Mr. Dally is as comforting as finding a \\"Beware of Dog\\" sign in a vampire's house. **MR. DILLY** Don't worry; we’ll catch that... uh, face-challenged individual. **THE OFFICE BREAK-IN** Within the confines of their temporary office prison, Velma discovers the magazine with torn pages, which is as good a clue as finding a needle in a stack of slightly smaller needles. **VELMA** This magazine is missing three pages. Either someone is into really niche origami, or we've got a lead. Chaos reigns as the No-Face Zombie and now, a giant gorilla (because why not escalate it with more wildlife?), join the fray, turning the factory into a three-ring circus minus the cotton candy. **SCOOBY & SHAGGY** In the cafeteria, the run-in with the popcorn machine turns them into an impromptu comedy duo, juggling popcorn like they're auditioning for the circus. **SHAGGY** Zoinks! Like, Scooby, catch! **SCOOBY** (Rapidly eating popcorn) Ropcorn! **MULTIPLE SCOOBYS** The duplication machine goes berserk, producing Scoobys like a malfunctioning Xerox. The result is pandemonium, with Scoobys running amok, each with an appetite to match. **VELMA** Well, I guess we found a way to clone hunger. **THE FINAL SHOWDOWN** The unmasking of Mr. Dilly as the gorilla is the coup de grâce, a resolution so bizarre it feels like the punchline to a joke told in an alternate universe. **FRED** And we would've gotten away with a quieter night if it wasn’t for this meddling millionaire and his ape suit! **THE CAFETERIA BURGER HEIST** Mr. Dally, in an act of rare culinary generosity, opens the factory cafeteria for a feast, only to have the moment soured by the discovery of the Scooby duplicates eating all the burgers. **MR. DALLY** Sorry, all the burgers are gone. Your... other selves had quite the feast. **SHAGGY** Man, even when we win, we lose. But at least we solved the mystery! **SCOBBY** Rehehe, roh rood! **THE GANG** (They all share a laugh, though Shaggy and Scooby's stomachs rumble in protest—mourning the burgers that could have been.) **FADE OUT** In the world of Mystery Inc., no mystery is too bizarre, and no meal is too secure. Their adventures continue, one missing burger at a time."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[아빠, 정신 차려. 이 집안이 일어서려면 맞벌이는 기본이야.] “성국아, 그러지 마.” 아빠는 가뿐히 나를 안아 들었다. 아직 20대 젊은 아빠의 힘에는 세 살짜리는 도대체 감당할 수가 없었다. “소영아, 네 마음은 알겠으니까 시간 좀 두고 진지하게 생각해보자.” “그렇게 하세요. 솔직히 계약서에 도장 찍기 전까지는 아무도 모르는 거잖아요. 임선미 계약이 성사되면 그때부터 일 시작해도 늦지 않을 거예요.” “와, 일한다니까 막 가슴이 두근거려. 나 옛날에 공부한 것들 좀 다시 꺼내 봐야겠어.” 엄마는 꽤 들뜬 얼굴이었다. * * * 임선미는 포커페이스로 신성중을 바라봤다. 신성중의 얼굴이 붉게 달아오르고 있었다. “선미야, 니가 나한테 이럼 안 되지.” “뭐가 안 된다는 말씀이세요?” “너 어려울 때 거둬주고 키워줬는데, 지금 와서 재계약을 안 한다고?” “어려울 때 거둬주고 키워주신 것에 대한 것은 제 개런티로 이미 갚고도 남은 것으로 아는데요.” “헛-.” 급기야 신성중은 콧방귀를 뀌었다. 그러더니 앞으로 자세를 모았다. 임선미는 팔짱을 낀 채 신성중을 여유롭게 바라봤다. 신성중이 깔 패가 뭔지 너무 보여서였다. “선미야, 너 말이야. 내가 입만 뻥긋하면 어찌 되는 줄 아니?” “…….” 임선미는 신성중의 다음 말을 끈질기게 기다렸다. “너 말이야. 내가 증권가에 찌라시 확 풀면.” “저는 더는 이렇게 더럽게 일하는 신 대표님과 일을 못 하겠습니다.” “야! 너 내가 누군 줄 알아?” “알죠. 당연히. 그 찌라시 어디든 풀리는 날에는 신 대표님도 이 바닥에서 더는 못 버틸 겁니다. 전재형 부회장님이 삼전 전속 모델인 제가 더러운 오물통에 빠지는 건 안 보고 계실 거거든요. 아시죠? 삼전 그룹에 찍힌 전신 기획이 어떻게 망했는지요. 대한민국에서 삼전 전자 광고 안 들어가는 프로는 하나도 없잖아요.” 신성중은 말을 잃었다. 말 대신 주먹을 꽉 쥐었다. 전신 기획은 삼전 그룹 전속 모델로 활동하던 배우의 마약 스캔들을 막지 못했다. 그 일로 삼전 그룹의 이미지에 손상을 입히는 바람에 손해배상 소송에 휘말려 완전히 공중분해 되고 말았다. 임선미는 자리에서 유유히 일어났다. 오늘따라 입은 샤랭의 트위드 재킷과 스커트가 빛을 발하는 순간이다. “신 대표님, 그동안 감사했습니다. 그리고 앞으로 만날 때도 신성 기획 대표였으면 좋겠네요.” “뭐?” 화가 난 신성중이 뒤따라 일어섰지만, 임선미는 그대로 뒤돌아 신성 기획 대표의 방을 나섰다. 그리고 입꼬리를 올렸다. 드디어 지긋지긋한 신성중에게서 벗어났다. 어쩌면 이 모든 게 성국이 덕분이라는 생각이 임선미 머릿속을 스쳤다. 성국이를 만나지 않았다면 이 모든 일은 불가능했을 테니까. * * * 1994년 7월 4일. 스포츠 신문 전면에 임선미의 재계약 소식이 전해졌다. <신성 기획을 떠난 임선미. 신생 기획사인 SKJ로! SKJ는 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’의 스타 전성국 군의 일인 소속사!> 벌써부터 더위가 기승을 부렸다. 나는 사무실을 꾸리고 있는 엄마와 김미영을 물끄러미 바라봤다. [왜 자꾸 겨드랑이에서 땀이 나는 걸까.] 나는 겨드랑이를 올려서 선풍기 앞에 대고 말렸다. 엄마와 김미영은 책상을 이리저리 놓아보고 있었다. “언니, 임선미 새 소속사가 사무실도 제대로 없는 거 알면 사람들이 놀라 자빠질 거예요.” “우리처럼 자유롭게 일하는 사람들이 뭐, 꼭 사무실이 필요한가요. 그리고 이게 무슨 사무실이에요. 우리 건물에 원룸 하나 뺀 건데요.” “덕분엔 전 아이들 근처에서 일할 수 있어서 너무 좋아요.” 그러니까 내 최초의 기획사는 바로 내가 살고 있는 다세대주택의 원룸이었다. 마침 나간다는 세입자가 있었고, 계속 나와 민국이를 걱정하는 아빠의 시름도 덜 적절한 선택이었다. 원룸에 책상과 의자를 놓고, 테이블도 마련하니 대충 사무실 같긴 했다. 엄마가 선풍기에 겨드랑이를 열고 말리는 나를 보고는 빙긋 웃었다. “성국아, 사무실 멋지지?” 도리도리. [너무 직설적이었나. 엄마 기 좀 살려줘야지.] 끄덕끄덕. “언니, 성국이도 마음에 드나 봐요.” “성국아, 원래 시작이 소박해야 다음이 멋진 거야.” [그놈의 초라한 시작은 내가 안 해본 거라 모르겠어, 김 매니저. 그나저나 에어컨 안 달아? 1994년 여름은 최악의 더위라고!] 엄마와 김미영도 땀을 비 오듯 흘리고 있었다. “언니, 이번 여름 정말 덥죠?” “7월 초인데, 이렇게 더우면 얼마나 더울지 걱정이 되긴 해요.” 띠리링. 띠리링. 띠리링. “언니, 전화요!” 엄마가 놀라 전화기를 손으로 가리켰다. “그건 이제부터 성국이 엄마 담당이죠.” “아, 맞다.” 엄마는 부랴부랴 전화를 받았다. “안녕하세요. SKJ 기획사입니다. 네. 7월 8일 금요일 저녁 스케줄 확인하고 다시 연락드릴게요.” 툭. 엄마는 전화를 끊고는 놀란 가슴 위로 손을 올렸다. “언니, 저 방금 삼전 전자 기획실에서 온 전화 받았어요.” “무슨 일이에요?” “7월 8일에 전재형 부회장 첫째 아들 생일이라고요. 삼전 호텔 다이아몬드 홀에서 저녁에 생일 파티하는데, 성국이 좀 와달라고 하네요.” 7월 8일은 평생 내 발 뒤꿈치도 못 쫓아온 전태국의 생일이었다. 나는 팔짱을 꼈다. [이게 어디서 오라 가라 갑질이야. 나 안 가! 절대 안 가!] 김미영이 수첩을 꺼내더니 스케줄을 확인했다. “성국이 의류 촬영이 다음 주니까, 금요일은 시간 괜찮을 것 같아요. 시간이랑 시간당 페이 제가 한번 조율해 볼게요.” [이봐, 김 매니저. 안 간다고!] 내가 종알거리자, 김미영이 귀엽다는 듯 볼을 꼬집었다. [김 매니저, 내 몸에 손대지 마.] “아우, 귀여워라. 성국아, 그날 내가 특별히 너 좋아하는 짜장면 주문해줄게.” [짜장면?] 꼴깍. 민망하게 침 넘어가는 소리가 요란했다. 전태국은 싫지만, 짜장면은 먹고 싶다. 나는 짧은 손가락으로 미간을 부여잡았다. [짜장면이냐, 전태국이냐. 이것이 고민이네.] “언니, 그 말 나오니 저희도 점심 먹어야죠. 중국집 어때요?” [엄마, 난 짜장.] 나는 번쩍 손을 들었다. “성국이는 짜장면 엄마랑 나눠 먹자.” [엄마, 나도 이제 한 그릇 먹는다고.] 이때, 초인종이 울리면서 임선미의 목소리가 들렸다. “여기가 그 유명한 SKJ 기획사 맞죠?” “어머, 어서 오세요.” 엄마가 임선미를 환하게 맞았다. “마침 잘 오셨어요. 저희 점심 먹으려고 하거든요. 선미 씨, 중국집 괜찮으세요?” “저 다음 달에 영화 들어가잖아요. 다이어트 중이랍니다. 이거 전해드리고 가려고요. 금전수예요. 앞으로 저도 SKJ 기획도 대박 나야 하잖아요.” 엄마는 얼른 금전수를 받아 들었다. “감사해요.” 임선미는 쀼루퉁한 나를 발견하곤 옆으로 다가왔다. “성국아, 덥지?” 나는 일부러 겨드랑이를 오픈하고 선풍기 앞에 앉았다. [선미 누나, 내가 지금 겨드랑이 벌리고 선풍기 앞에 서 있는 거 보면 모르겠어?] 임선미가 엄마를 뒤돌아봤다. “성국이 어머니, 제가 개업 기념으로 에어컨 선물할게요.” “괜찮아요. 저희는 쭉 선풍기로 잘 견뎠어요.” [에어컨 없이 살아본 것은 지금까지도 족하다고. 서민 체험 많이 했느니, 어서 받아, 엄마!] “제가 잘 보여야 하는데, 금전수 하나는 부족하죠. 사실은 주문 다 넣고 왔어요. 올해 여름 너무 더워서 계약이 너무 밀려 있어서 며칠 걸린다고 하더라고요.” 나는 임선미에게 엄지를 치켜세웠다. [온몸에 땀띠 나서 죽는 줄 알았는데, 다행이네. 고마워, 선미 누나.] 김미영이 임선미에게 차가운 보리차를 내밀었다. “이건 다이어트에 상관없으니 괜찮으시죠?” “그럼요. 참, 저 다음 영화 촬영 지방이 많은데 잘 부탁드릴게요.” “걱정 마세요. 안 그래도 내일 영화사 만나서 숙소부터 다 정리하기로 했어요.” “제가 딴 건 다 괜찮은데, 잠자리가 좀 예민해요.” “당연히 예민하셔야죠. 잠이 가장 중요한데요. 그런 거 걱정 마세요. 혹 더 살펴봐야 할 것 있으면 격 없이 말하세요. 제가 그런 것도 다 알아야 챙기죠.” “그럼, 오늘 가서 저녁에 좀 적어보고 내일 아침에 일찍 전화 드릴게요.” “네!” 김미영은 어느새 제법 프로처럼 대답했다. [김 매니저, 이게 다 내 덕분이라고. 그러니 어서 짜장면 부탁해.] * * * “성국아, 아침이야. 일어나야지!” [아, 눈 뜨기 싫다.] 나는 몸을 뒤척였다. 돈만 아니면 전태국의 생일에 가기는 죽기보다 싫었다. “성국아, 세수하고 치카해야지.” [시로. 시로.] 나는 졸린 눈을 최대한 비볐다. 그러면서 어느새 익숙하게 엄마 품에 안겼다. [하아, 엄마 품은 역시 따뜻했다. 난 왜 이 좋은 것을 회귀 전에는 몰랐던 걸까.] 엄마가 내 머리를 손으로 쓸어내렸다. “성국아, 오늘은 집에서 쉴래? 전재형 부회장님 아들이 널 너무 보고 싶다고 했다는데, 네가 싫다면 쉬어도 돼.” [엄마, 뭔 소리야. 얼굴 비치고 천만 원이야. 전태국이 아니라 38선 넘어 김일성 생일 파티에도 갈 판이라고. 아, 맞다….] 그 순간, 나의 뇌리에 스치는 사건 하나가 있었다. 1994년 무더운 여름. 바로 북한의 김일성이 죽었다.","completion":"Episode 22 Nod. My heavy head drooped forward. I quickly slapped my face with both hands. Slap. Slap. Slap. My mom, looking pitiful, picked me up. \\"Sung-guk, are you sleepy?\\" [I'm sleepy, but I can't sleep.] I shook my head. \\"Sung-guk, let mom put you to sleep.\\" [What are you talking about! I can't sleep.] I quickly escaped from my mom's arms and started walking around the room. Right now, my mom, Kim Mi-young, and dad were having a serious discussion about recruiting Im Sun-mi. I couldn't miss such an important conversation among adults. Dad looked worried. \\"If Im Sun-mi comes, it's not just about the conditions, but can we handle it?\\" \\"First of all, Im Sun-mi's manager agreed to move together. There are about two projects under contract negotiation, and both are just waiting for the signature. She wants to sign the contracts as soon as she moves to our agency.\\" Kim Mi-young explained in detail the content of her communication with Im Sun-mi. Despite being a high school graduate, Kim Mi-young, who had a lot of experience at Samjeon Planning, was reliable when it came to work. \\"Instead of a signing bonus, she wants a 3-year contract, and the ratio to be 9 to 1. Honestly, even 10% of Im Sun-mi's advertising, drama, and movie signing fees would be enough for our scale to make a profit.\\" Toddle toddle. I aimlessly walked around the room, nodding my head. Im Sun-mi was more ambitious than I thought. In a situation where countless celebrities live their entire lives leeching off their families, she appropriately cut off her family and seemed to be preparing for her future. In three years, Im Sun-mi would be in her mid to late 30s. In the early 90s, the position of actresses in their mid to late 30s was narrowing, and retiring upon marriage was one of the set patterns in the entertainment industry. Dad looked at Kim Mi-young with a troubled face. \\"If this happens, we'll really become a proper company. I honestly want to do my current job better.\\" \\"Honey.\\" Mom intervened. \\"How about I work?\\" \\"Soyoung...\\" Dad looked at mom blankly for a moment. \\"I graduated from a commercial high school and worked in accounting. I have what I learned during my three years of high school and some work experience. I can handle the company's finances. If my sister handles external matters as she does now, I can take care of the company's household.\\" Mom had her own determination. Kim Mi-young added. \\"Mr. Sung-guk's father, think about it. It seems like a good proposal. Especially if we recruit Im Sun-mi, we'll need an employee to take care of the company's household, and there's no one more trustworthy than Sung-guk's mom.\\" \\"Honey, I want to work.\\" Mom slightly nagged dad. \\"What about Sung-guk and Min-guk?\\" [Don't worry about me. I can even change my own diapers now.] \\"There's the aunt who occasionally looks after Min-guk. Having experienced her work, I think she's reliable and Min-guk likes her, so it should be fine to trust her.\\" \\"It's the age to be taking care of kids...\\" Dad's face hardened. I toddled over and pretended to hit dad's back hard. Whack! [Dad, wake up. Dual income is basic for this family to stand up.] \\"Sung-guk, don't do that.\\" Dad easily picked me up. At the strength of a young dad in his 20s, a three-year-old had no chance. \\"Soyoung, I understand how you feel, so let's take some time and think about it seriously.\\" \\"Let's do that. Honestly, until the contract is stamped, nobody knows. If the contract with Im Sun-mi is finalized, it won't be too late to start working then.\\" \\"Wow, thinking about working makes my heart flutter. I should take out my old study materials.\\" Mom looked quite excited. * * * Im Sun-mi looked at Shin Sung-jung with a poker face. Shin Sung-jung's face was turning red. \\"Sun-mi, you shouldn't do this to me.\\" \\"What do you mean I shouldn't?\\" \\"When you were struggling, I took you in and raised you, and now you're saying you won't renew the contract?\\" \\"I believe I've already repaid you with my guarantees, and even more.\\" \\"Huh-.\\" Eventually, Shin Sung-jung snorted. Then he leaned forward. Im Sun-mi, with her arms crossed, looked at Shin Sung-jung leisurely. It was too obvious what Shin Sung-jung's trump card was. \\"Sun-mi, you know. If I just open my mouth, what will happen?\\" \\"......\\" Im Sun-mi waited persistently for Shin Sung-jung's next words. \\"If I spread rumors in the stock market.\\" \\"I can no longer work with President Shin in such a dirty manner.\\" \\"Hey! Do you know who I am?\\" \\"Of course. Definitely. The day those rumors spread, President Shin won't last in this industry either. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung won't just watch his exclusive model for Samjeon, me, fall into a dirty pit. You know? How Jeonshin Planning collapsed after being blacklisted by Samjeon Group. There's not a single show in South Korea that doesn't have Samjeon Electronics' advertisements.\\" Shin Sung-jung was at a loss for words. Instead, he clenched his fist. Jeonshin Planning failed to prevent a drug scandal involving an actress who was an exclusive model for Samjeon Group. Because of that incident, it damaged Samjeon Group's image, got entangled in a compensation lawsuit, and completely disintegrated. Im Sun-mi gracefully stood up from her seat. Today, the tweed jacket and skirt she wore from Charang shone brightly. \\"President Shin, thank you for everything. And I hope you remain as the president of Shinseong Planning in the future.\\" \\"What?\\" Angered, Shin Sung-jung stood up, but Im Sun-mi turned around and left the president of Shinseong Planning's office. And she lifted the corners of her mouth. She finally escaped from the detestable Shin Sung-jung. Perhaps all of this was thanks to Sung-guk. If she hadn't met Sung-guk, none of this would have been possible. * * * July 4, 1994. The front page of the sports newspaper reported the news of Im Sun-mi's contract renewal. <Im Sun-mi leaves Shinseong Planning. Moves to the new agency SKJ! SKJ is the one-man agency of the star of \\"Five Men and a Baby Basket,\\" Sung-guk!> The heat was already unbearable. I watched mom and Kim Mi-young setting up the office. [Why does sweat keep coming from my armpits?] I raised my armpits and dried them in front of the fan. Mom and Kim Mi-young were trying to place the desk here and there. \\"People will be shocked to know that Im Sun-mi's new agency doesn't even have a proper office.\\" \\"Do people like us who work freely really need an office? And what kind of office is this? It's just a rented room in our building.\\" \\"It's great because I can work close to the kids.\\" So, my first agency was a rented room in the multi-family house where I lived. There was a tenant who was moving out, and it was an appropriate choice to lessen dad's worries about me and Min-guk. With a desk, chairs, and a table set up, it somewhat looked like an office. Mom smiled at me as I opened my armpits and sat in front of the fan. \\"Sung-guk, isn't the office cool?\\" Shake shake. [I was too direct. I should cheer up mom.] Nod nod. \\"Sung-guk seems to like it too.\\" \\"Sung-guk, everything starts modestly to become great later.\\" [I don't know about that modest start since I haven't experienced it, Manager Kim. By the way, isn't there an air conditioner? The summer of 1994 is the worst!] Mom and Kim Mi-young were also sweating profusely. \\"Unnie, it's really hot this summer, isn't it?\\" \\"It's only early July, but I'm worried about how hot it will get.\\" Ring ring ring. \\"Unnie, it's the phone!\\" Mom pointed at the phone in surprise. \\"That's now mom's responsibility.\\" \\"Oh, right.\\" Mom hurriedly answered the phone. \\"Hello, this is SKJ Planning. Yes. I'll confirm the schedule for Friday, July 8th, and call you back.\\" Thud. Mom hung up the phone and placed her hand over her startled heart. \\"Unnie, that was a call from Samjeon Electronics' planning department.\\" \\"What's the matter?\\" \\"They said it's Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's eldest son's birthday on July 8th. They're having a birthday party at Samjeon Hotel's Diamond Hall in the evening and asked if Sung-guk could come.\\" July 8th was the birthday of Jeon Tae-guk, who could never catch up to me in my entire life. I crossed my arms. [Where do they get off telling me to come and go? I'm not going! Absolutely not!] Kim Mi-young checked the schedule and replied. \\"Sung-guk has a clothing shoot next week, so Friday should be fine. I'll negotiate the time and hourly pay.\\" [Hey, Manager Kim. I said I'm not going!] As I babbled, Kim Mi-young pinched my cheek as if I was cute. [Manager Kim, don't touch my body.] \\"Aw, so cute. Sung-guk, I'll specially order your favorite jjajangmyeon that day.\\" [Jjajangmyeon?] Gulp. The sound of swallowing saliva was embarrassingly loud. I disliked Jeon Tae-guk, but I wanted to eat jjajangmyeon. I grabbed my short fingers to my forehead. [Jjajangmyeon or Jeon Tae-guk. This is the dilemma.] \\"Unnie, speaking of which, we should have lunch too. How about Chinese food?\\" [Mom, I want jjajangmyeon.] I raised my hand high. \\"Sung-guk, let's share a bowl of jjajangmyeon with mom.\\" [Mom, I can eat a whole bowl now.] At that moment, the doorbell rang, and Im Sun-mi's voice was heard. \\"Is this the famous SKJ Planning?\\" \\"Come in, please.\\" Mom warmly welcomed Im Sun-mi. \\"You came at the right time. We were about to have lunch. Sun-mi, is Chinese food okay?\\" \\"I'm going into a movie next month, so I'm on a diet. I came to give you this. It's a money tree. Both I and SKJ Planning need to hit the jackpot.\\" Mom quickly took the money tree. \\"Thank you.\\" Im Sun-mi approached me, who was pouting, and came to my side. \\"Sung-guk, is it hot?\\" I deliberately opened my armpits and sat in front of the fan. [Sun-mi, can't you see I'm opening my armpits and sitting in front of the fan?] Im Sun-mi turned to look at mom. \\"Sung-guk's mom, I'll gift you an air conditioner as a housewarming present.\\" \\"That's okay. We've been fine with just a fan.\\" [We've had enough of living without an air conditioner. We've experienced enough of being commoners, so please accept it, mom!] \\"Actually, I've already placed an order. This summer is so hot that the installation is backed up, so it might take a few days.\\" I gave Im Sun-mi a thumbs up. [I thought I was going to die from heat rash all over my body, but thankfully. Thank you, Sun-mi.] Kim Mi-young offered Im Sun-mi a cold barley tea. \\"This won't affect your diet, right?\\" \\"Of course. By the way, my next movie shoot is in the countryside, so please take care of it.\\" \\"Don't worry. I've already arranged to meet with the film company tomorrow to sort everything out, from accommodations.\\" \\"I'm not picky about anything else, but I'm a bit sensitive about my sleeping environment.\\" \\"Of course, you should be sensitive. Sleep is the most important. Don't worry about that. If there's anything else you need to look into, don't hesitate to tell me. I need to know to take care of it.\\" \\"Then, I'll go today and write some things down and call you early tomorrow morning.\\" \\"Okay!\\" Kim Mi-young responded like a true professional. [Manager Kim, this is all thanks to me. So, please order the jjajangmyeon.] * * * \\"Sung-guk, it's morning. Time to wake up!\\" [Ah, I don't want to open my eyes.] I tossed and turned. If it weren't for the money, I would hate to go to Jeon Tae-guk's birthday more than death. \\"Sung-guk, let's wash your face and brush your teeth.\\" [No. No.] I rubbed my sleepy eyes as much as I could. And before I knew it, I was comfortably in mom's arms. [Ah, mom's arms are always warm. Why didn't I realize this good thing before my regression?] Mom stroked my head with her hand. \\"Sung-guk, do you want to rest at home today? Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's son really wants to see you, but if you don't like it, you can rest.\\" [Mom, what are you talking about. It's a million won just to show my face. I'd even go to Kim Il-sung's birthday party in North Korea if it weren't for the money. Ah, right...] At that moment, an event flashed through my mind. The hot summer of 1994. It was when North Korea's Kim Il-sung died."},{"prompt":"제24화 삼전 호텔 다이아몬드 홀은 내가 기억하는 모습 그대로였다. 값비싼 샹들리에. 격식 있게 차려진 테이블들. 그 주변으로 장식된 화환들과 절도 있게 음식을 나르는 직원들. 전태국은 잔뜩 볼멘 얼굴로 팔짱을 끼고 자리에 앉아 있었다. 전재형 부회장과 어머니 철의 여인의 모습은 아직도 보이지 않았다. 대신 양 비서가 그 옆에 앉아서 전태국을 달래느라 진땀을 쏟고 있었다. [사내자식이 속 좁긴. 사람 안 변해. 쯧쯧.] “주문하신 짜장면 나왔습니다.” 단정한 옷을 입은 직원이 내 앞으로 삼전 호텔의 짜장면을 한 그릇 내려놓았다. 나는 얼른 내 앞에 놓인 삼전 호텔의 짜장을 한 포크 집어서 돌돌 말아 호로록 먹었다. 엄마가 내 등을 어루만졌다. “성국아, 천천히 먹어.” 끄덕. 나는 고개를 끄덕이곤 다시 짜장면을 호로록 먹었다. 엄마와 김미영은 부모도 없는 이 화려한 생일 파티가 적응하기 힘든 모양이었다. “언니, 아무리 김일성 주석이 죽었다고 해도 아버지도 아들 생일에 안 나타나는 건 너무하는 거 아니에요?” “재벌들은 진짜 우리 같은 사람이랑은 생각이 다른 것 같아요.” [다르다 뿐일까. 일반인들은 절대 이해할 수 없지.] 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. 그 바람에 입가가 짜장 범벅이 됐다. “성국아, 짜장 맛있지?” “녜엥!” 나는 어깨를 들썩였다. 부모 없는 전태국 생일 파티에 와서 첫사랑 정희도 만나고, 맛있는 삼전 호텔 짜장면도 먹고. 나는 저절로 어깨춤이 나왔다. “성국아!” 뒤에서 나를 부르는 익숙한 목소리가 들렸다. 뒤를 보니 ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 모두 몰려와 있었다. 전태국은 요즘 가장 잘나가는 ‘저스트’도 부른 모양이었다. 리더인 태형이 다가와서 짧게 안부를 물었다. “어머니, 잘 지내시죠?” “오늘 공연하시는 거예요?” “네, 근데 끝나고 바로 가봐야 해서 지금 성국이한테 인사하려고요. 성국이가 뽑아준 <거짓이야>로 저희 대박 났잖아요. 성국아, 고마워.” [고마움은 마음이 아니라 물질로 표시하는 거야.] 다른 멤버 셋이 차례로 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 또 보자.” [바빠져서 이젠 한동안 얼굴 보기 힘들 거야. 고생해, 다들.] 나는 싱긋 웃어줬다. ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 엄마와 김미영에게 마저 인사를 하고는 급히 무대 위로 올라갔다. “요즘 ‘저스트’ 멤버들 잠잘 시간도 없대요.” 김미영이 요즘 ‘저스트’가 얼마나 잘나가는지에 대해서 설명해줬다. 나야 익히 알고 있던 일이다. ‘저스트’는 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 이후로 인기가 급상승하더니 삼전 전자 광고까지 귀한 몸인 나와 찍고 연이어 낸 앨범까지 대박이 났다. 애만 키우는 그룹인 줄 알았는데, 노래까지 잘한다는 게 업계의 반응이었다. 더군다나 내가 뽑은 <거짓이야>는 공전의 히트를 기록했다. 무대에 선 ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 전태국을 향해 90도로 인사했다. “전태국 도련님 열 살 생일을 축하드려요! 오늘 세상에서 가장 행복한 하루 되시라고 저희가 노래를 준비했습니다. 초록색 풍선 불러 드릴게요!” 태형의 말이 끝나자마자 음악이 흘러나왔다. ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 TV 방송국 음악 방송보다 더 열심히 무대를 누렸다. 심지어 라이브였다. 어린아이의 생일 파티라고 무시하면 안 됐다. 바로 오늘은 삼전 전자의 후계자가 될 전태국의 생일 파티였고, 엄청난 페이가 보장된 무대였다. 나는 원래는 내가 앉아 있었던 자리에 거만하게 앉아 있는 전태국을 바라봤다. 전태국의 뚱한 얼굴은 바뀌지 않았다. 억지로 옆에 앉은 정희는 ‘저스트’를 보며 신나 할 뿐이었다. 이때, 뒤에서 전태국의 어깨를 잡는 손이 보였다. 전태국이 뒤돌아본 자리에는 전재형 부회장이 있었다. 전재형 부회장은 곧 빈 옆자리에 앉았다. 그제야 전태국의 굳은 얼굴에 희미하게 미소가 떠올랐다. 나는 저게 무슨 의미인지 너무 잘 알고 있었다. 오늘 하루 종일 전태국이 짜증 났던 것은 원래 성격이 못된 것도 있었지만, 불안했기 때문이었다. 겨우 열 살이다. 그런데 생일날 아빠도 엄마도 없다. 아무리 쇼윈도 부부라지만, 그래도 부모는 부모이다. 이때, 옆에서 익숙한 냄새가 났다. 정확히 이야기하면 익숙한 향수였다. [이건?] “이 아이가 성국이군요.” 절도 있는 목소리. 바로 철의 여인이었다. 순간 나는 숨이 턱 멈추는 것 같았다. “어-.” 나는 얼른 입을 닫았다. 아버지였던 전재형 부회장을 볼 때와는 다른 감정이었다. 아무리 정 한 조각 주지 않던 철의 여인이었다 해도, 어머니는 또 다른 의미가 있었다. 엄마는 누군지 몰랐지만, 삼전 기획에서 일한 김미영은 철의 여인을 한눈에 알아보고 자리에서까지 일어났다. “저는 전성국 군 매니저 김미영입니다. 이쪽은 어머니 되세요.” “실제로 보니 화면보다 더 똘똘해 보이네요. 성국이 덕분에 저희 회사 인지도가 친근해졌다고 이야기 많이 들었습니다.” 삼전 그룹을 저희 회사라고 말 할 수 있는 몇 안 되는 사람. 엄마는 그제야 얼른 일어나 인사를 했다. “성국이가 엄마를 엄청 챙기네요. 그럼, 재밌게 지내고 가세요.” 철의 여인은 허리를 꼿꼿이 세우고 전태국의 옆자리에 가서 앉았다. 엄마와 김미영은 한숨을 돌렸다. “저분이 삼전 그룹 전재형 부회장 부인이시군요. 전재형 부회장님 가족도 되게 단란해 보여요.” [엄마, 보이는 게 전부는 아니야.] 나는 고개를 도리도리 흔들었다. 드디어 ‘저스트’의 노래가 끝나고 여기저기서 박수 소리가 들렸다. 전재형 부회장과 철의 여인의 등장에 얼굴이 환해진 전태국이 정희의 반응을 보며 신나게 박수를 쳤다. 나는 정희의 옆자리, 전태국이 앉은 자리를 물끄러미 응시했다. [전태국, 방심하지 마. 네 자리보다 내가 더 높은 자리에 앉을 테니까. 조금만… 한 20년만 기다려!] * * * “와!” 엄마가 연신 감탄사를 내뱉었다. 민국이를 안은 아빠도 흐뭇한 표정을 지었다. “소영아, 그렇게 좋아?” “당연하지. 내 평생 이렇게 넓고 좋은 집에 살 거라고는 상상도 못 했어.” 엄마의 눈시울이 붉어졌다. 뒷짐을 진 채 아파트 이곳저곳을 훑어보던 나는 엄마에게 다가가서 엄마의 손을 꼭 잡았다. [엄마, 겨우 34평이야. 뭘 이것 가지고 그래. 거기다 서울 완전 외곽인 잠실이잖아. 여기 완전 촌동네네.] 아빠에게 안긴 민국이도 엄마가 울자 따라 울기 시작했다. 이제 민국이도 어엿한 세 살이 되었다. “어엄마. 으아앙!” “알았어. 민국아, 엄마 안 울게.” “소영아, 이렇게 좋은 날 울면 어떡해.” [내 말이 그 말이야.] 나는 붙박이로 시공된 아파트 곳곳도 열어봤다. [돈 좀 쓰지. 또 싸구려 자재 썼네. 쯧쯧.] “소영아, 이제 방도 세 개니까 우리 성국이랑 민국이 하나씩 주면 되겠다. 그치?” “민국이는 아직 어리니까, 우리가 데리고 자야 하지 않을까?” [잠깐만. 뭐야, 민국이만 자식이야? 이 아파트, 내가 삼전 전자랑 전속 계약하고 받은 거잖아.] 혼자 방을 쓰라면 좋을 줄 알았는데, 이런 마음이 문득 드는 것은 왜일까. 나는 얼른 엄마의 다리에 얼굴을 비볐다. 부비부비. “성국아, 엄마랑 자고 싶어?” “네!” 다섯 살이 된 내 발음도 제법 정확해졌다. “그럼, 우리 네 식구 다 같이 잘까?” [그건 좀 별로인데. 민국이 녀석 세 살인데 이제 독립해도 되지.] 아빠가 얼른 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 넌 이제 다섯 살이야. 유치원도 가는데, 방 혼자 써야지.” [싫다고!] 나는 발버둥을 쳤다. “자기야, 성국이 마음의 준비 될 때까지 다 같이 자자.” “어쩔 수 없네.” 아빠는 그제야 나를 바닥에 내려놨다. 나는 다시 뒷짐을 지고 아파트 이곳저곳을 살폈다. 가끔 있는 일이었지만, 종종 삼전 건설 현장에 가서 이것저것 살피며 기자들에게 과시용 사진을 찍기도 했다. 단가에 맞춰 싸구려 자재를 쓰는 거야 이 업계에서 어쩔 수 없는 일이었지만, 그나마 삼전 건설이 조금은 낫긴 했다. 나는 부엌 옆에 놓인 방으로 발걸음을 옮겼다. 사람들이 오가는 현관 바로 옆의 방보다는 이곳이 더 나을 것 같았다. 그리고 이제 슬슬 내가 어떤 사람인지도 보여줄 때가 된 것 같다. 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “성국아, 이 방 마음에 들어?” “네! 나, 이 방.” 나는 힘차게 대답했다. “아까는 혼자 자기 싫다며?” [잠은 혼자 안 자고, 공부만 여기서 할 거야.] 나는 아빠에게 텅 빈 벽면을 가리켰다. “아빠!” “왜, 성국아?” “책땅.” “책상 사달라고?” “응!” 나는 격하게 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 드디어 내일이면 이사다. 수유에서 잠실로. 투 룸에서 34평 아파트로. 내 인생도 한 단계 점프하는 날이다. 그래서인지 왠지 잠이 잘 오지 않았다. 삼전 그룹의 부회장 자리에 있을 때에는 주로 실적 때문에 잠을 못 이뤘다. 이미 많은 것을 가지고 태어났기 때문에 집이나 차 같은 하찮은 것은 내 고민꺼리가 되지 못했다. 하지만 이번 생에서 인생의 새로운 국면을 맞는다는 게 이렇게 설레고 행복할 수 있다는 게 신선했다. 나는 엄마 품으로 파고 들어가려다 그만 민국이의 정수리에 코를 박고 말았다. [하아, 경쟁자 녀석.] 경쟁자 녀석은 하루가 다르게 부쩍부쩍 자랐다. 거기다 몸무게도 엄청 늘었다. 여전히 나보다 작지만, 방심하면 안 된다. “성국아, 잠이 안 와?” 엄마가 따뜻한 목소리로 물었다. “응!” “엄마도 잠이 안 와.” “아빠도 잠 안 온다, 성국아.” 뒤에서 아빠도 불쑥 고개를 내밀었다. 모두들 내일 이사로 인한 설렘으로 잠을 못 자는 것 같았다. [엄마, 아빠, 없는 거 티 나게 왜들 그래. 다들 그깟 아파트가 뭐라고.] 하지만 내 입도 이미 싱글벙글이었다. 아빠는 그동안 차곡차곡 모아온 돈으로 새 가구 중에 내 책상을 가장 먼저 사주셨다. 이사에 맞춰 배달도 부탁했다. 물론 내가 썼던 그 어느 책상보다 싸구려였지만, 앉아서 공부할 책상이 생긴 것만으로도 행복했다. 아빠가 자리에서 벌떡 일어나더니, 구석에 놓인 가방을 들고 왔다. “자기야, 또 확인하게?” “응. 잠도 안 오는데 마지막으로 확인하게.” 아빠가 들고 앉은 것은 통장이 든 작은 가방이었다. 가방을 열자 묵직한 통장 꾸러미가 나왔다. “이건 생활비 통장. 이건 적금. 이건 청약 부금. 소영아, 청약 부금은 이제 집 생겼으니 없앨까?” “그냥 두자. 미영 언니 말로는 청약 통장은 그냥 두는 거래. 이 집에서 더 넓혀갈 수도 있잖아.” [역시 엄마!] 나는 엄마의 등을 토닥, 토닥 두 번 두드렸다. 잘했다는 의미였다. “자기야, 내가 요즘에 성국이 가만히 관찰하니까, 이 녀석이 지 마음에 들면 손으로 두 번, 마음에 안 들면 세 번, 이렇게 두드리는 거야.” [눈치챈 거야?] “성국이 저 녀석 정말 보통이 아니라니까.” 아빠는 미소를 지으며 통장을 내 눈앞에 들어 보였다. “성국아, 이거 기억나?” 끄덕. [엄마, 아빠가 준 내 생애 최초의 선물이잖아.] 내가 번 돈 모두를 내 미래를 위해 저축한다는 엄마, 아빠의 말은 거짓이 아니었다. 얼마라도 빼 쓸 만도 한데, 내가 번 돈 모두를 통장에 저금했다. 삼전 전자의 모델료뿐 아니라 사이사이 찍은 단발성 광고와 지면 광고 등으로 이미 내 통장에는 3억이 넘는 돈이 들어와 있었다. 거기다 삼전 전자의 주식까지. [밥 안 먹어도 배부른 게 이런 느낌이구나.] 나는 괜히 푹신한 이불 위로 앞구르기를 하며 재롱을 부렸다. “성국아, 그렇게 좋아?” 옜다, 기분이다. 나는 팔을 쭉 뻗어 머리 위에 올리고 하트 모양을 만들었다. “엄마, 아빠. 따랑해요.” 그동안 내가 번 돈을 한 푼도 허투루 쓰지 않고 잘 모아준 엄마, 아빠에 대한 보답이었다. 그리고 돈이 없어도 행복할 수 있다는 것을 알려준 것에 대한 감사이기도 했다. 이제 전성국 인생도 한 단계 업그레이드이다!","completion":"Episode 24 The Samjeon Hotel's Diamond Hall was exactly as I remembered it. Expensive chandeliers. Elegantly set tables. Around them, wreaths and staff moving food with precision. Jeon Tae-guk sat with his arms crossed, his face full of displeasure. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung and the Iron Lady, his mother, were nowhere to be seen yet. Instead, Secretary Yang sat next to him, sweating as he tried to soothe Tae-guk. [Such a narrow-minded boy. People never change. Tsk tsk.] \\"Your jjajangmyeon is served.\\" A neatly dressed staff member placed a bowl of Samjeon Hotel's jjajangmyeon in front of me. I quickly twirled a forkful of the jjajangmyeon and slurped it down. Mom patted my back. \\"Sung-guk, eat slowly.\\" Nod. I nodded and continued to slurp down the jjajangmyeon. Mom and Kim Mi-young seemed to struggle to adapt to this lavish birthday party without the parents. \\"Even if President Kim Il-sung died, isn't it too much for a father not to show up for his son's birthday?\\" \\"The thoughts of chaebols really do seem different from ours.\\" [Is it just different? Ordinary people could never understand.] I nodded. That made my mouth covered in jjajang sauce. \\"Sung-guk, is the jjajang tasty?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I shrugged my shoulders. Attending Jeon Tae-guk's parentless birthday party, meeting my first love Jeong-hee, and eating delicious Samjeon Hotel jjajangmyeon. I couldn't help but dance a little shoulder dance. \\"Sung-guk!\\" A familiar voice called me from behind. Turning around, I saw all the members of 'Just' had arrived. It seemed Jeon Tae-guk had invited 'Just', the currently most popular group. The leader, Tae-hyung, came up and briefly asked how we were. \\"Ma'am, how have you been?\\" \\"Are you performing today?\\" \\"Yes, but we have to leave right after, so we came to greet Sung-guk now. Thanks to Sung-guk choosing 'It's a Lie', we hit the jackpot.\\" [Gratitude should be shown with material things, not just feelings.] The other three members took turns patting my head. \\"Sung-guk, let's meet again.\\" [I'll be too busy to see your faces for a while. Good luck, everyone.] I smiled back. The 'Just' members greeted mom and Kim Mi-young before hurriedly climbing onto the stage. \\"'Just' members hardly have time to sleep these days.\\" Kim Mi-young explained how popular 'Just' had become. I was well aware of it. 'Just' had soared in popularity after \\"Five Men and a Baby Basket\\", shot a precious commercial with me for Samjeon Electronics, and their subsequent album was a huge hit. People thought they were just a group raising a baby, but they were also recognized for their singing talent. Moreover, \\"It's a Lie\\", which I had chosen, was a massive hit. The 'Just' members on stage bowed 90 degrees towards Jeon Tae-guk. \\"We wish Jeon Tae-guk a happy 10th birthday! We've prepared a song to make today the happiest day for you. We'll sing 'Green Balloon' for you!\\" As soon as Tae-hyung finished speaking, music started playing. The 'Just' members enjoyed the stage even more than they did on TV music broadcasts. It was even a live performance. One shouldn't underestimate a child's birthday party. Today was the birthday party of Jeon Tae-guk, the future heir of Samjeon Electronics, and the stage came with a hefty pay. I looked at Jeon Tae-guk, who was now sitting arrogantly in the seat I had been in. Tae-guk's sullen face hadn't changed. Jeong-hee, forced to sit next to him, was just excited to see 'Just'. Then, a hand reached out and touched Tae-guk's shoulder from behind. Turning around, Tae-guk saw Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. Vice Chairman Jeon soon sat in the empty seat next to him. Only then did a faint smile appear on Tae-guk's stiff face. I knew too well what that meant. Tae-guk had been grumpy all day not just because of his bad personality, but because he was anxious. He was only ten years old. And yet, on his birthday, neither his dad nor mom was there. No matter how much of a show-window couple they were, parents are still parents. Then, a familiar scent reached me. To be precise, it was a familiar perfume. [Is this?] \\"A dignified voice.\\" It was the Iron Lady. Suddenly, I felt like my breath was caught in my throat. \\"Uh-.\\" I quickly shut my mouth. The feeling was different from when I saw Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, my father. No matter how little affection the Iron Lady showed, a mother had a different meaning. Mom, not recognizing her, but Kim Mi-young, who had worked at Samjeon Planning, recognized the Iron Lady at a glance and even stood up from her seat. \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>-young, the manager of Jeon Sung-guk. This is his mother.\\" \\"Seeing him in person, he seems even smarter than on screen. Thanks to Sung-guk, our company's image has become more approachable, I've heard a lot.\\" One of the few people who could refer to Samjeon Group as \\"our company.\\" Mom then quickly stood up to greet her. \\"Sung-guk really takes care of his mom. Well, have fun and take care.\\" The Iron Lady straightened her back and sat next to Jeon Tae-guk. Mom and Kim Mi-young sighed in relief. \\"That lady is the wife of Samjeon Group's Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. The Jeon family seems really harmonious.\\" [Mom, appearances aren't everything.] I shook my head. Finally, 'Just's song ended, and applause came from all around. Jeon Tae-guk, whose face brightened with the arrival of Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung and the Iron Lady, clapped excitedly, watching Jeong-hee's reaction. I stared intently at the seat where Jeon Tae-guk was sitting, next to Jeong-hee. [Jeon Tae-guk, don't be complacent. I'll sit in a higher position than yours. Just wait... maybe for about 20 years!] * * * \\"Wow!\\" Mom kept exclaiming in amazement. Dad, holding Min-guk, also had a pleased expression. \\"Soyoung, are you that happy?\\" \\"Of course. I never imagined I'd live in such a spacious and nice house in my life.\\" Mom's eyes reddened. As I walked around the apartment with my hands behind my back, I approached mom and held her hand tightly. [Mom, it's just 34 pyeong. Why are you making such a fuss? Besides, it's in the outskirts of Seoul, in Jamsil. It's practically the countryside.] Seeing mom cry, Min-guk, now a proud three-year-old, started to cry too. \\"Mommy. Wah!\\" \\"Okay, Min-guk. Mom won't cry.\\" \\"Soyoung, how can you cry on such a good day?\\" [That's what I'm saying.] I checked every corner of the apartment with built-in furniture. [Spend some money. They used cheap materials again. Tsk tsk.] \\"Soyoung, now that we have three rooms, we can give one to Sung-guk and one to Min-guk, right?\\" \\"Min-guk is still young, so shouldn't we sleep with him?\\" [Wait a minute. Am I not your child too? This apartment was obtained through my exclusive contract with Samjeon Electronics.] I thought I'd be happy to have my own room, but why did I suddenly feel this way? I quickly rubbed my face against mom's leg. Rub rub. \\"Sung-guk, do you want to sleep with mom?\\" \\"Yes!\\" My pronunciation had become quite accurate now that I was five years old. \\"Then, shall all four of us sleep together?\\" [That's a bit... Min-guk is three years old now; he can be independent.] Dad quickly picked me up. \\"Sung-guk, you're five years old now. You're going to kindergarten, so you should have your own room.\\" [No!] I struggled. \\"Honey, let's all sleep together until Sung-guk is ready.\\" \\"There's no other way.\\" Dad finally put me down. I walked around the apartment again, inspecting every corner. I occasionally visited Samjeon Construction sites to check things out and take photos for the press. Using cheap materials to match the price was unavoidable in this industry, but Samjeon Construction was somewhat better. I moved towards the room next to the kitchen. It seemed better than the room right next to the entrance where people come and go. And it seemed about time to show who I really am. I shrugged my shoulders. \\"Sung-guk, do you like this room?\\" \\"Yes! This room.\\" I answered energetically. \\"Weren't you saying you didn't want to sleep alone earlier?\\" [I'm not going to sleep alone; I'll just study here.] I pointed to an empty wall. \\"Dad!\\" \\"Yes, Sung-guk?\\" \\"Desk.\\" \\"Do you want me to buy a desk?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I nodded vigorously. * * * Finally, tomorrow is moving day. From Suyu to Jamsil. From a two-room to a 34 pyeong apartment. It's the day my life takes a leap forward. That's probably why I couldn't sleep well. When I was a vice chairman at Samjeon Group, I mostly stayed awake because of performance issues. Since I was born with a lot, trivial things like houses or cars never bothered me. But experiencing a new phase in life in this life felt fresh and happy. I tried to snuggle into mom's arms but ended up bumping my nose into Min-guk's head. [Ah, my rival.] The rival was growing rapidly day by day. And his weight had increased significantly. Though still smaller than me, I couldn't be complacent. \\"Sung-guk, can't you sleep?\\" Mom asked in a warm voice. \\"Yes!\\" \\"Mom can't sleep either.\\" \\"Dad can't sleep either, Sung-guk.\\" Dad also popped his head from behind. It seemed everyone was too excited about tomorrow's move to sleep. [Mom, Dad, why are you making such a big deal out of an apartment?] But my mouth was already smiling. Dad had prioritized buying me a desk with the money he had saved up, ordering it to be delivered in time for the move. Of course, it was cheaper than any desk I had used before, but just having a desk to study on made me happy. Dad suddenly got up and brought over a bag from the corner. \\"Honey, shall we check again?\\" \\"Yes. Since we can't sleep, let's check one last time.\\" What Dad brought over was a small bag containing bankbooks. Opening the bag, a hefty bundle of bankbooks appeared. \\"This is the living expenses account. This is the savings account. This is the housing subscription savings. Soyoung, now that we have a house, should we cancel the housing subscription savings?\\" \\"Let's keep it. Mi-young said it's better to keep the housing subscription account. We might move to a bigger house from this one.\\" [Way to go, Mom!] I patted mom's back twice as a sign of approval. \\"Honey, I've been observing Sung-guk lately, and if he likes something, he pats twice; if he doesn't, he pats three times.\\" [You noticed?] \\"Sung-guk is really extraordinary.\\" Dad smiled and showed me the bankbooks. \\"Sung-guk, do you remember this?\\" Nod. [It's the first gift from Mom and Dad in my life.] Mom and Dad's words about saving all the money I earned for my future weren't lies. They didn't spend a penny of my earnings, saving everything in the bankbooks. Not only the model fees from Samjeon Electronics but also the one-time advertisements and print ads had already brought over 300 million won into my account. And even shares of Samjeon Electronics. [So this is what it feels like to be full without eating.] I playfully rolled around on the soft blanket. \\"Sung-guk, are you that happy?\\" Here, take my mood. I stretched my arms above my head and made a heart shape. \\"Mom, Dad. I love you.\\" It was my way of thanking Mom and Dad for not wasting a single penny of the money I earned and for teaching me that happiness is possible even without money. Now, Jeon Sung-guk's life is also upgrading!"},{"prompt":"non mi funziona lo scambio di messaggi tra client e server in questi snippet, qui il client public static void searchHotel(BufferedReader in,PrintWriter out,Scanner input) throws IOException { Gson gson = new Gson(); String name; System.out.println(\\"Inserisci il nome di un hotel\\"); name = input.nextLine(); out.println(name); System.out.println(\\"Inserisci la citta' in cui cercarlo\\"); String city = input.nextLine(); out.println(city); System.out.println(\\"Risultati:\\"); String h = in.readLine(); System.out.println(h); Hotel hotel = gson.fromJson(h, hotelType); System.out.println(hotel); } e qui il task server public void searchHotel(BufferedReader in, PrintWriter out)throws IOException{ Gson gson = new Gson(); String hotel = in.readLine(); System.out.println(\\"hotel: \\"); System.err.println(username); System.out.println(\\"citta: \\"); String citta = in.readLine(); List<Hotel> hotels; try{ String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(HotelsPath))); hotels = gson.fromJson(content,hotelListType); for(Hotel h : hotels){ if(h.getHotelName().compareTo(hotel)==0){ out.println(h); } } } catch(IOException e){ e.printStackTrace(); } } , l'hotel non viene ricevuto dal task server che assegna null come valore, come mai?","completion":"La problematica che stai riscontrando potrebbe essere dovuta a vari motivi. Tuttavia, basandomi su ciò che hai condiviso, proverò a offrirti alcune linee guida per cercare di identificare ed eventualmente risolvere il problema. 1. **Flushing dei Dati**: Assicurati che dopo aver inviato dati dal client al server (e viceversa) venga fatto il flush del buffer di output. Questo si può fare chiamando \`out.flush()\` dopo \`out.println(name)\` e \`out.println(city)\` nel client. Questo assicura che i dati effettivamente vengano inviati immediatamente al server. \`\`\`java out.println(name); out.flush(); out.println(city); out.flush(); \`\`\` 2. **Controllo sul Lato Server**: Verifica che il server stia ricevendo correttamente i dati. Potrebbe essere utile stampare i valori ricevuti immediatamente dopo la loro lettura per assicurarsi che non siano \`null\`. \`\`\`java String hotel = in.readLine(); System.out.println(\\"Hotel ricevuto: \\" + hotel); String citta = in.readLine(); System.out.println(\\"Città ricevuta: \\" + citta); \`\`\` 3. **Errore di Scrittura e Lettura JSON**: Verifica che il tipo \`hotelType\` sia correttamente definito e utilizzato. Nell'esempio che hai fornito non è chiaro come \`hotelType\` sia definito. Se stai cercando di deserializzare un singolo oggetto \`Hotel\`, dovresti utilizzare \`Hotel.class\` come tipo. Assicurati che la risposta dal server sia effettivamente un JSON valido che corrisponde alla struttura di un oggetto \`Hotel\`. \`\`\`java Hotel hotel = gson.fromJson(h, Hotel.class); \`\`\` 4. **Gestione delle Eccezioni**: Nel server, dopo il tentativo di lettura del file e la deserializzazione, non stai inviando nulla al client nel caso in cui non ci sia alcun hotel che corrisponde ai criteri di ricerca. Potresti considerare l'invio di un messaggio o di un oggetto JSON che il client può riconoscere come una risposta \\"vuota\\" o \\"nessun risultato trovato\\". \`\`\`java boolean found = false; for(Hotel h : hotels) { if(h.getHotelName().compareTo(hotel) == 0) { out.println(gson.toJson(h)); found = true; break; // assumendo che cerchi un solo hotel } } if(!found) { out.println(\\"NESSUN RISULTATO\\"); // oppure un JSON vuoto {} } out.flush(); \`\`\` 5. **Protocollo di Comunicazione**: Assicurati di avere un protocollo di comunicazione chiaro tra client e server. Per esempio, se il server invia più righe come risposta, il client dovrebbe sapere come gestirle (ad esempio, attendere una linea specifica che segnala la fine dei dati). Verifica queste aree nel tuo codice e fai le adeguate correzioni. Se il problema persiste, potrebbe essere utile analizzare dettagliatamente i log di comunicazione o eseguire il debug del codice passo dopo passo per capire esattamente dove la comunicazione fallisce."},{"prompt":"perché è necessario serializzare e deserializzare quando si passano json fra thread o procesis diversi?","completion":"La serializzazione e la deserializzazione sono processi fondamentali quando si passano dati, come JSON, tra thread o processi diversi. Ecco perché sono necessari: 1. **Rappresentazione uniforme dei dati**: La serializzazione trasforma un oggetto o una struttura dati in una rappresentazione in formato stringa (ad es., JSON, XML) o in un formato binario. Questo rende i dati facilmente trasmissibili attraverso rete o interscambiabili tra componenti software che possono non condividere la stessa rappresentazione interna dei dati. 2. **Indipendenza dalla piattaforma e dal linguaggio**: Gli oggetti e le strutture dati possono essere rappresentati in modi molto diversi in memoria, a seconda del linguaggio di programmazione o dell'architettura hardware utilizzata. Serializzando i dati in un formato neutrale come JSON, si assicura che il destinatario, indipendentemente dalla piattaforma o dal linguaggio di programmazione, possa deserializzarli e riconstruire l'oggetto originale o la struttura dati. 3. **Interscambiabilità e integrazione**: In un’architettura basata su microservizi o in sistemi distribuiti, diverse parti del sistema possono essere scritte in linguaggi diversi e funzionare su macchine diverse. La serializzazione consente a queste componenti di comunicare e scambiarsi dati in modo efficace, indipendentemente dalle loro implementazioni interne. 4. **Persistenza dei dati**: Non solo per la comunicazione tra processi o thread, ma la serializzazione è anche utile per salvare lo stato di un oggetto in un formato persistente, come un file o un database, per poi recuperarlo (deserializzazione) in un secondo momento, preservandone stato e comportamento. 5. **Sicurezza e validazione**: Quando si ricevono dati serializzati (ad es., in formato JSON) da un altro processo o thread, questi dati possono essere validati prima di procedere alla loro deserializzazione. Questo aiuta a evitare problemi di sicurezza, come vulnerabilità di injection o tentativi di corrompere lo stato di un'applicazione. 6. **Prestazioni e ottimizzazione**: La serializzazione consente di comprimere o ottimizzare i dati per la trasmissione riducendo la loro dimensione, il che è critico in ambienti con limitazioni di banda o per migliorare le prestazioni complessive del sistema. In somma, la serializzazione e la deserializzazione sono meccanismi essenziali per l'interoperabilità, l'integrazione e l'efficienza nella comunicazione tra processi, thread o componenti software, specialmente in un'era dominata da sistemi e applicazioni distribuite."},{"prompt":"data questa struttura import java.util.List; public class Hotel { public String id,name,description,city,phone,rate; List<String> services; Ratings ratings; public Hotel(){ } public String getHotelName() { return name; } public String getHotelId(){ return id; } public String getHotelDesc(){ return description; } public String getHotelCity(){ return city; } public String getHotelPhone(){ return phone; } public String getHotelRate(){ return rate; } public List<String> getHotelServ(){ return services; } public Ratings getHotelRatings(){ return ratings; } // public String getPassword() { // return password; // } } class Ratings{ int cleaning; int position; int services; int quality; } quando nel codice vado a deserializzare hotel Hotel hotel = gson.fromJson(h, Hotel.class); System.out.println(\\"id: \\"+hotel.getHotelId()); System.out.println(\\"nome: \\"+hotel.getHotelName()); System.out.println(\\"descrizione: \\"+hotel.getHotelDesc()); System.out.println(\\"citta’: \\"+hotel.getHotelCity()); System.out.println(\\"telefono: \\"+hotel.getHotelPhone()); System.out.println(\\"costo: \\"+hotel.getHotelRate()); System.out.println(\\"servizi: \\"+hotel.getHotelServ()); System.out.println(\\"voti: \\"+hotel.getHotelRatings()); ottengo sui ratings Ratings@fad74ee, come faccio a referenziare correttamente i ratings?","completion":"La parte del tuo output \\"Ratings@fad74ee\\" è in realtà la rappresentazione sotto forma di stringa dell'istanza di \`Ratings\` restituita dal metodo \`toString()\` di default della classe Object in Java.

La rappresentazione di default mostra il nome della classe seguito dal simbolo \\"@\\" e da un hashcode in esadecimale, che non è utile se vuoi visualizzare in maniera leggibile il contenuto delle proprietà di \`Ratings\`. Per risolvere questo problema e stampare il contenuto di \`Ratings\` in modo chiaro, puoi sovrascrivere il metodo \`toString()\` nella classe \`Ratings\`. Ecco come potresti farlo: \`\`\`java class Ratings { int cleaning; int position; int services; int quality; // Sovrascrivi il metodo toString @Override public String toString() { return \\"Cleaning: \\" + cleaning + \\", Position: \\" + position + \\", Services: \\" + services + \\", Quality: \\" + quality; } } \`\`\` In questo modo, invece di visualizzare \\"Ratings@fad74ee\\", vedrai qualcosa come: \`\`\` Cleaning: [valore], Position: [valore], Services: [valore], Quality: [valore] \`\`\` Ricorda, \`[valore]\` sarà sostituito con i valori effettivi delle proprietà di quella specifica istanza di \`Ratings\`.

Di seguito un esempio di come potresti implementare questo: \`\`\`java import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; class Ratings { int cleaning; int position; int services; int quality; //... altre parti della classe, come costruttori // Metodo per ritornare i ratings come lista di interi public List<Integer> asList() { List<Integer> ratingsList = new ArrayList<>(); ratingsList.add(cleaning); ratingsList.add(position); ratingsList.add(services); ratingsList.add(quality); return ratingsList; } @Override public String toString() { // Implementazione del toString se necessaria return \\"Cleaning: \\" + cleaning + \\", Position: \\" + position + \\", Services: \\" + services + \\", Quality: \\" + quality; } } \`\`\` In questo modo, puoi chiamare il metodo \`asList()\` su un'istanza di \`Ratings\` per ottenere una lista di interi rappresentanti i valori dei rating. Ecco come potresti utilizzare questo metodo nella tua classe principale o dove necessario: \`\`\`java // Supponiamo che 'hotel' sia un'istanza di 'Hotel' e che sia già stata popolata Ratings ratings = hotel.getHotelRatings(); List<Integer> ratingsList = ratings.asList(); System.out.println(\\"Ratings List: \\" + ratingsList); \`\`\` Il codice sopra stampa la lista dei valori di valutazione come una lista di interi.

[사내자식이 속 좁긴. 사람 안 변해. 쯧쯧.] “주문하신 짜장면 나왔습니다.” 단정한 옷을 입은 직원이 내 앞으로 삼전 호텔의 짜장면을 한 그릇 내려놓았다. 나는 얼른 내 앞에 놓인 삼전 호텔의 짜장을 한 포크 집어서 돌돌 말아 호로록 먹었다. 엄마가 내 등을 어루만졌다. “성국아, 천천히 먹어.” 끄덕. 나는 고개를 끄덕이곤 다시 짜장면을 호로록 먹었다. 엄마와 김미영은 부모도 없는 이 화려한 생일 파티가 적응하기 힘든 모양이었다. “언니, 아무리 김일성 주석이 죽었다고 해도 아버지도 아들 생일에 안 나타나는 건 너무하는 거 아니에요?” “재벌들은 진짜 우리 같은 사람이랑은 생각이 다른 것 같아요.” [다르다 뿐일까. 일반인들은 절대 이해할 수 없지.] 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. 그 바람에 입가가 짜장 범벅이 됐다. “성국아, 짜장 맛있지?” “녜엥!” 나는 어깨를 들썩였다. 부모 없는 전태국 생일 파티에 와서 첫사랑 정희도 만나고, 맛있는 삼전 호텔 짜장면도 먹고. 나는 저절로 어깨춤이 나왔다. “성국아!” 뒤에서 나를 부르는 익숙한 목소리가 들렸다. 뒤를 보니 ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 모두 몰려와 있었다. 전태국은 요즘 가장 잘나가는 ‘저스트’도 부른 모양이었다. 리더인 태형이 다가와서 짧게 안부를 물었다. “어머니, 잘 지내시죠?” “오늘 공연하시는 거예요?” “네, 근데 끝나고 바로 가봐야 해서 지금 성국이한테 인사하려고요. 성국이가 뽑아준 <거짓이야>로 저희 대박 났잖아요. 성국아, 고마워.” [고마움은 마음이 아니라 물질로 표시하는 거야.] 다른 멤버 셋이 차례로 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 또 보자.” [바빠져서 이젠 한동안 얼굴 보기 힘들 거야. 고생해, 다들.] 나는 싱긋 웃어줬다. ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 엄마와 김미영에게 마저 인사를 하고는 급히 무대 위로 올라갔다. “요즘 ‘저스트’ 멤버들 잠잘 시간도 없대요.” 김미영이 요즘 ‘저스트’가 얼마나 잘나가는지에 대해서 설명해줬다. 나야 익히 알고 있던 일이다. ‘저스트’는 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 이후로 인기가 급상승하더니 삼전 전자 광고까지 귀한 몸인 나와 찍고 연이어 낸 앨범까지 대박이 났다. 애만 키우는 그룹인 줄 알았는데, 노래까지 잘한다는 게 업계의 반응이었다. 더군다나 내가 뽑은 <거짓이야>는 공전의 히트를 기록했다. 무대에 선 ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 전태국을 향해 90도로 인사했다. “전태국 도련님 열 살 생일을 축하드려요! 오늘 세상에서 가장 행복한 하루 되시라고 저희가 노래를 준비했습니다. 초록색 풍선 불러 드릴게요!” 태형의 말이 끝나자마자 음악이 흘러나왔다. ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 TV 방송국 음악 방송보다 더 열심히 무대를 누렸다. 심지어 라이브였다. 어린아이의 생일 파티라고 무시하면 안 됐다. 바로 오늘은 삼전 전자의 후계자가 될 전태국의 생일 파티였고, 엄청난 페이가 보장된 무대였다. 나는 원래는 내가 앉아 있었던 자리에 거만하게 앉아 있는 전태국을 바라봤다. 전태국의 뚱한 얼굴은 바뀌지 않았다. 억지로 옆에 앉은 정희는 ‘저스트’를 보며 신나 할 뿐이었다. 이때, 뒤에서 전태국의 어깨를 잡는 손이 보였다. 전태국이 뒤돌아본 자리에는 전재형 부회장이 있었다. 전재형 부회장은 곧 빈 옆자리에 앉았다. 그제야 전태국의 굳은 얼굴에 희미하게 미소가 떠올랐다. 나는 저게 무슨 의미인지 너무 잘 알고 있었다. 오늘 하루 종일 전태국이 짜증 났던 것은 원래 성격이 못된 것도 있었지만, 불안했기 때문이었다. 겨우 열 살이다. 그런데 생일날 아빠도 엄마도 없다. 아무리 쇼윈도 부부라지만, 그래도 부모는 부모이다. 이때, 옆에서 익숙한 냄새가 났다. 정확히 이야기하면 익숙한 향수였다. [이건?] “이 아이가 성국이군요.” 절도 있는 목소리. 바로 철의 여인이었다. 순간 나는 숨이 턱 멈추는 것 같았다. “어-.” 나는 얼른 입을 닫았다. 아버지였던 전재형 부회장을 볼 때와는 다른 감정이었다. 아무리 정 한 조각 주지 않던 철의 여인이었다 해도, 어머니는 또 다른 의미가 있었다. 엄마는 누군지 몰랐지만, 삼전 기획에서 일한 김미영은 철의 여인을 한눈에 알아보고 자리에서까지 일어났다. “저는 전성국 군 매니저 김미영입니다. 이쪽은 어머니 되세요.” “실제로 보니 화면보다 더 똘똘해 보이네요. 성국이 덕분에 저희 회사 인지도가 친근해졌다고 이야기 많이 들었습니다.” 삼전 그룹을 저희 회사라고 말 할 수 있는 몇 안 되는 사람. 엄마는 그제야 얼른 일어나 인사를 했다. “성국이가 엄마를 엄청 챙기네요. 그럼, 재밌게 지내고 가세요.” 철의 여인은 허리를 꼿꼿이 세우고 전태국의 옆자리에 가서 앉았다. 엄마와 김미영은 한숨을 돌렸다. “저분이 삼전 그룹 전재형 부회장 부인이시군요. 전재형 부회장님 가족도 되게 단란해 보여요.” [엄마, 보이는 게 전부는 아니야.] 나는 고개를 도리도리 흔들었다. 드디어 ‘저스트’의 노래가 끝나고 여기저기서 박수 소리가 들렸다. 전재형 부회장과 철의 여인의 등장에 얼굴이 환해진 전태국이 정희의 반응을 보며 신나게 박수를 쳤다. 나는 정희의 옆자리, 전태국이 앉은 자리를 물끄러미 응시했다. [전태국, 방심하지 마. 네 자리보다 내가 더 높은 자리에 앉을 테니까. 조금만… 한 20년만 기다려!] * * * “와!” 엄마가 연신 감탄사를 내뱉었다. 민국이를 안은 아빠도 흐뭇한 표정을 지었다. “소영아, 그렇게 좋아?” “당연하지. 내 평생 이렇게 넓고 좋은 집에 살 거라고는 상상도 못 했어.” 엄마의 눈시울이 붉어졌다. 뒷짐을 진 채 아파트 이곳저곳을 훑어보던 나는 엄마에게 다가가서 엄마의 손을 꼭 잡았다. [엄마, 겨우 34평이야. 뭘 이것 가지고 그래. 거기다 서울 완전 외곽인 잠실이잖아. 여기 완전 촌동네네.] 아빠에게 안긴 민국이도 엄마가 울자 따라 울기 시작했다. 이제 민국이도 어엿한 세 살이 되었다. “어엄마. 으아앙!” “알았어. 민국아, 엄마 안 울게.” “소영아, 이렇게 좋은 날 울면 어떡해.” [내 말이 그 말이야.] 나는 붙박이로 시공된 아파트 곳곳도 열어봤다. [돈 좀 쓰지. 또 싸구려 자재 썼네. 쯧쯧.] “소영아, 이제 방도 세 개니까 우리 성국이랑 민국이 하나씩 주면 되겠다. 그치?” “민국이는 아직 어리니까, 우리가 데리고 자야 하지 않을까?” [잠깐만. 뭐야, 민국이만 자식이야? 이 아파트, 내가 삼전 전자랑 전속 계약하고 받은 거잖아.] 혼자 방을 쓰라면 좋을 줄 알았는데, 이런 마음이 문득 드는 것은 왜일까. 나는 얼른 엄마의 다리에 얼굴을 비볐다. 부비부비. “성국아, 엄마랑 자고 싶어?” “네!” 다섯 살이 된 내 발음도 제법 정확해졌다. “그럼, 우리 네 식구 다 같이 잘까?” [그건 좀 별로인데. 민국이 녀석 세 살인데 이제 독립해도 되지.] 아빠가 얼른 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 넌 이제 다섯 살이야. 유치원도 가는데, 방 혼자 써야지.” [싫다고!] 나는 발버둥을 쳤다. “자기야, 성국이 마음의 준비 될 때까지 다 같이 자자.” “어쩔 수 없네.” 아빠는 그제야 나를 바닥에 내려놨다. 나는 다시 뒷짐을 지고 아파트 이곳저곳을 살폈다. 가끔 있는 일이었지만, 종종 삼전 건설 현장에 가서 이것저것 살피며 기자들에게 과시용 사진을 찍기도 했다. 단가에 맞춰 싸구려 자재를 쓰는 거야 이 업계에서 어쩔 수 없는 일이었지만, 그나마 삼전 건설이 조금은 낫긴 했다. 나는 부엌 옆에 놓인 방으로 발걸음을 옮겼다. 사람들이 오가는 현관 바로 옆의 방보다는 이곳이 더 나을 것 같았다. 그리고 이제 슬슬 내가 어떤 사람인지도 보여줄 때가 된 것 같다. 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “성국아, 이 방 마음에 들어?” “네! 나, 이 방.” 나는 힘차게 대답했다. “아까는 혼자 자기 싫다며?” [잠은 혼자 안 자고, 공부만 여기서 할 거야.] 나는 아빠에게 텅 빈 벽면을 가리켰다. “아빠!” “왜, 성국아?” “책땅.” “책상 사달라고?” “응!” 나는 격하게 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 드디어 내일이면 이사다. 수유에서 잠실로. 투 룸에서 34평 아파트로. 내 인생도 한 단계 점프하는 날이다. 그래서인지 왠지 잠이 잘 오지 않았다. 삼전 그룹의 부회장 자리에 있을 때에는 주로 실적 때문에 잠을 못 이뤘다. 이미 많은 것을 가지고 태어났기 때문에 집이나 차 같은 하찮은 것은 내 고민꺼리가 되지 못했다. 하지만 이번 생에서 인생의 새로운 국면을 맞는다는 게 이렇게 설레고 행복할 수 있다는 게 신선했다. 나는 엄마 품으로 파고 들어가려다 그만 민국이의 정수리에 코를 박고 말았다. [하아, 경쟁자 녀석.] 경쟁자 녀석은 하루가 다르게 부쩍부쩍 자랐다. 거기다 몸무게도 엄청 늘었다. 여전히 나보다 작지만, 방심하면 안 된다. “성국아, 잠이 안 와?” 엄마가 따뜻한 목소리로 물었다. “응!” “엄마도 잠이 안 와.” “아빠도 잠 안 온다, 성국아.” 뒤에서 아빠도 불쑥 고개를 내밀었다. 모두들 내일 이사로 인한 설렘으로 잠을 못 자는 것 같았다. [엄마, 아빠, 없는 거 티 나게 왜들 그래. 다들 그깟 아파트가 뭐라고.] 하지만 내 입도 이미 싱글벙글이었다. 아빠는 그동안 차곡차곡 모아온 돈으로 새 가구 중에 내 책상을 가장 먼저 사주셨다. 이사에 맞춰 배달도 부탁했다. 물론 내가 썼던 그 어느 책상보다 싸구려였지만, 앉아서 공부할 책상이 생긴 것만으로도 행복했다. 아빠가 자리에서 벌떡 일어나더니, 구석에 놓인 가방을 들고 왔다. “자기야, 또 확인하게?” “응. 잠도 안 오는데 마지막으로 확인하게.” 아빠가 들고 앉은 것은 통장이 든 작은 가방이었다. 가방을 열자 묵직한 통장 꾸러미가 나왔다. “이건 생활비 통장. 이건 적금. 이건 청약 부금. 소영아, 청약 부금은 이제 집 생겼으니 없앨까?” “그냥 두자. 미영 언니 말로는 청약 통장은 그냥 두는 거래. 이 집에서 더 넓혀갈 수도 있잖아.” [역시 엄마!] 나는 엄마의 등을 토닥, 토닥 두 번 두드렸다. 잘했다는 의미였다. “자기야, 내가 요즘에 성국이 가만히 관찰하니까, 이 녀석이 지 마음에 들면 손으로 두 번, 마음에 안 들면 세 번, 이렇게 두드리는 거야.” [눈치챈 거야?] “성국이 저 녀석 정말 보통이 아니라니까.” 아빠는 미소를 지으며 통장을 내 눈앞에 들어 보였다. “성국아, 이거 기억나?” 끄덕. [엄마, 아빠가 준 내 생애 최초의 선물이잖아.] 내가 번 돈 모두를 내 미래를 위해 저축한다는 엄마, 아빠의 말은 거짓이 아니었다. 얼마라도 빼 쓸 만도 한데, 내가 번 돈 모두를 통장에 저금했다. 삼전 전자의 모델료뿐 아니라 사이사이 찍은 단발성 광고와 지면 광고 등으로 이미 내 통장에는 3억이 넘는 돈이 들어와 있었다. 거기다 삼전 전자의 주식까지. [밥 안 먹어도 배부른 게 이런 느낌이구나.] 나는 괜히 푹신한 이불 위로 앞구르기를 하며 재롱을 부렸다. “성국아, 그렇게 좋아?” 옜다, 기분이다. 나는 팔을 쭉 뻗어 머리 위에 올리고 하트 모양을 만들었다. “엄마, 아빠. 따랑해요.” 그동안 내가 번 돈을 한 푼도 허투루 쓰지 않고 잘 모아준 엄마, 아빠에 대한 보답이었다. 그리고 돈이 없어도 행복할 수 있다는 것을 알려준 것에 대한 감사이기도 했다. 이제 전성국 인생도 한 단계 업그레이드이다!","completion":"Episode 24 The Samjeon Hotel Diamond Hall was just as I remembered it. Expensive chandeliers. Tables set with formality. Around them, wreaths decorated and staff moving food with precision. Jeon Taeguk sat with a sulky face, arms crossed, seated. Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung and the iron lady, his mother, were still nowhere to be seen. Instead, Secretary Yang was sitting next to him, sweating bullets trying to soothe Taeguk. [Such a narrow-minded guy. People don't change. Tsk tsk.] \\"Your Jajangmyeon is served.\\" A neatly dressed staff member placed a bowl of Samjeon Hotel's Jajangmyeon in front of me. I quickly twirled a forkful of the Samjeon Hotel's Jajangmyeon and slurped it down. My mom patted my back. \\"Sungguk, eat slowly.\\" Nod. I nodded and slurped down the Jajangmyeon again. Mom and Kim Miyoung seemed to have a hard time adapting to this glamorous birthday party without parents. \\"Sister, even if President Kim Il Sung died, isn't it too much for dad not to show up for his son's birthday?\\" \\"Chaebols really think differently from people like us.\\" [Is it just different? Ordinary people can never understand.] I nodded. That made my mouth covered in Jajang sauce. \\"Sungguk, is the Jajang tasty?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I shrugged my shoulders. Coming to Taeguk's birthday party without parents, meeting my first love Jeonghee, and eating delicious Samjeon Hotel Jajangmyeon. I couldn't help but dance with joy. \\"Sungguk!\\" A familiar voice called me from behind. Looking back, all the members of 'Just' had gathered. It seemed Taeguk had invited the currently popular 'Just'. The leader, Taehyung, came over and briefly asked how we were. \\"Mother, are you doing well?\\" \\"Are you performing today?\\" \\"Yes, but we have to leave right after, so we're greeting Sungguk now. Thanks to Sungguk choosing 'It's a Lie', we hit the jackpot. Sungguk, thank you.\\" [Gratitude is shown not by heart but by material.] The other three members took turns patting my head. \\"Sungguk, let's meet again.\\" [We'll be busy, so it'll be hard to see each other for a while. Take care, everyone.] I smiled brightly. The 'Just' members greeted my mom and Kim Miyoung before hurriedly going up on stage. \\"Recently, 'Just' members hardly have time to sleep.\\" Kim Miyoung explained how popular 'Just' has become lately. I already knew that. 'Just' soared in popularity after 'Five Men and a Baby Basket', shot a precious commercial with me for Samjeon Electronics, and their subsequent album was a huge hit. People thought they were just a group raising a baby, but they were also recognized for their singing. Moreover, 'It's a Lie', which I chose, was a phenomenal hit. The 'Just' members on stage bowed 90 degrees to Taeguk. \\"We wish Jeon Taeguk a happy 10th birthday! We've prepared a song to make today the happiest day for you. We'll sing 'Green Balloon'!\\" As soon as Taehyung finished speaking, music started playing. The 'Just' members enjoyed the stage more than they did on TV music broadcasts. It was even a live performance. One shouldn't underestimate a child's birthday party. Today was the birthday party of Jeon Taeguk, the future heir of Samjeon Electronics, and the stage guaranteed a huge pay. I looked at Taeguk, who was sitting arrogantly in the seat I was originally in. Taeguk's sullen face hadn't changed. Jeonghee, forced to sit next to him, was just excitedly watching 'Just'. Then, a hand was seen grabbing Taeguk's shoulder from behind. Turning around, Taeguk saw Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung. Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung soon sat in the empty seat next to him. Only then did a faint smile appear on Taeguk's stiff face. I knew too well what that meant. Taeguk was grumpy all day not just because of his bad personality, but because he was anxious. He's only ten years old. But on his birthday, neither dad nor mom was there. Even if they were a show-window couple, parents are still parents. Then, a familiar scent reached me. To be precise, a familiar perfume. [Is this?] \\"This must be Sungguk.\\" A dignified voice. It was the iron lady. Suddenly, I felt like my breath was caught in my throat. \\"Uh-.\\" I quickly shut my mouth. Even though she was the iron lady who didn't give a single piece of affection, a mother had a different meaning. Mom didn't know who she was, but Kim Miyoung, who worked at Samjeon Planning, recognized the iron lady at a glance and even stood up from her seat. \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, manager of Jeon Sungguk. This is his mother.\\" \\"Seeing him in person, he looks even smarter than on screen. Thanks to Sungguk, our company's image has become more approachable, I've heard a lot.\\" One of the few people who could refer to Samjeon Group as \\"our company.\\" Mom quickly stood up and greeted her. \\"Sungguk takes great care of his mom. Then, have fun and go.\\" The iron lady straightened her back and sat next to Taeguk. Mom and Kim Miyoung sighed in relief. \\"That person is the wife of Samjeon Group's Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung. The Jeon Jaehyung family seems really harmonious.\\" [Mom, appearances aren't everything.] I shook my head. Finally, 'Just's song ended, and applause was heard from here and there. With the arrival of Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung and the iron lady, Taeguk's face brightened, and he excitedly clapped, watching Jeonghee's reaction. I stared blankly at the seat next to Jeonghee, where Taeguk was sitting. [Taeguk, don't be careless. I'll sit in a higher position than yours. Just wait... for about 20 years!] * * * \\"Wow!\\" Mom kept exclaiming in admiration. Dad, holding Minguk, also had a pleased expression. \\"Soyoung, are you that happy?\\" \\"Of course. I never imagined I'd live in such a spacious and nice house in my life.\\" Mom's eyes reddened. While I was looking around the apartment with my hands behind my back, I approached mom and firmly held her hand. [Mom, it's just 34 pyeong. What's the big deal? Besides, it's in the outskirts of Seoul, in Jamsil. It's totally countryside here.] Even Minguk, held by dad, started crying seeing mom cry. Minguk has now turned three years old. \\"Mommy. Wah!\\" \\"Alright, Minguk. Mom won't cry.\\" \\"Soyoung, how can you cry on such a good day.\\" [That's what I'm saying.] I checked every corner of the apartment with built-in furniture. [Use some money. They used cheap materials again. Tsk tsk.] \\"Soyoung, now that we have three rooms, we can give one each to Sungguk and Minguk, right?\\" \\"Minguk is still young, so shouldn't we sleep with him?\\" [Wait a minute. What, only Minguk is your child? This apartment, I got it by signing an exclusive contract with Samjeon Electronics.] I thought I'd be happy to have my own room, but why did I feel this way all of a sudden? I quickly rubbed my face against mom's leg. Rub rub. \\"Sungguk, do you want to sleep with mom?\\" \\"Yes!\\" My pronunciation has become quite accurate now that I'm five years old. \\"Then, shall all four of us sleep together?\\" [That's a bit... Minguk is three years old, he can be independent now.] Dad quickly picked me up. \\"Sungguk, you're five years old now. You're going to kindergarten, so you should have your own room.\\" [I don't want to!] I struggled. \\"Dear, let's all sleep together until Sungguk is ready.\\" \\"There's no other way.\\" Dad finally put me down. I walked around the apartment again, inspecting here and there. I occasionally visited Samjeon Construction sites to check things and take photos for the press. Using cheap materials to match the price was unavoidable in this industry, but Samjeon Construction was slightly better. I moved towards the room next to the kitchen. It seemed better than the room right next to the entrance where people come and go. And it seemed about time to show what kind of person I am. I shrugged my shoulders. \\"Sungguk, do you like this room?\\" \\"Yes! This room.\\" I answered energetically. \\"You didn't want to sleep alone earlier?\\" [I'm not going to sleep alone, just study here.] I pointed to the empty wall to dad. \\"Dad!\\" \\"Yes, Sungguk?\\" \\"Desk.\\" \\"Do you want me to buy a desk?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I nodded vigorously. * * * Finally, tomorrow is moving day. From Suyu to Jamsil. From a two-room to a 34-pyeong apartment. It's the day my life takes a leap forward. That's probably why I couldn't sleep well. When I was a vice chairman at Samjeon Group, I usually couldn't sleep because of performance issues. Since I was born with a lot, trivial things like houses or cars never bothered me. But facing a new phase in life in this life felt so fresh and happy. I tried to snuggle into mom's arms but ended up bumping my nose into Minguk's head. [Sigh, my rival.] The rival kid grew noticeably day by day. And his weight increased significantly. Though still smaller than me, I couldn't be careless. \\"Sungguk, can't you sleep?\\" Mom asked in a warm voice. \\"Yes!\\" \\"Mom can't sleep either.\\" \\"Dad can't sleep either, Sungguk.\\" Dad also popped his head from behind. It seemed everyone couldn't sleep because of the excitement for tomorrow's move. [Mom, dad, why are you making it obvious that you have nothing? It's just an apartment.] But my mouth was already smiling. Dad got up briskly and brought a bag from the corner. \\"Dear, shall we check again?\\" \\"Yes. Since we can't sleep, let's check one last time.\\" Dad sat down with a small bag that contained bankbooks. Opening the bag, a heavy bundle of bankbooks appeared. \\"This is the living expenses bankbook. This is the savings. This is the housing subscription savings. Soyoung, now that we have a house, should we cancel the housing subscription savings?\\" \\"Let's keep it. Miyoung said it's better to keep the housing subscription account. We might move to a bigger house from this one.\\" [Way to go, mom!] I patted mom's back twice as a sign of approval. \\"Dear, I've been observing Sungguk lately, and if he likes something, he pats twice, and if he doesn't, he pats three times.\\" [You noticed?] \\"Sungguk is really extraordinary.\\" Dad smiled and showed me the bankbooks. \\"Sungguk, do you remember this?\\" Nod. [It's the first gift from mom and dad in my life.] Mom and dad's words about saving all the money I earned for my future were not a lie. Even though they could have spent a bit, they saved all the money I earned in the bankbook. Not only the model fee from Samjeon Electronics but also the one-time ads and print ads in between had already brought over 3 billion won into my bankbook. Plus, shares of Samjeon Electronics. [So this is what it feels like to be full without eating.] I playfully rolled on the soft blanket. \\"Sungguk, are you that happy?\\" Here, take this, my mood. I stretched my arms above my head and made a heart shape. \\"Mom, dad. I love you.\\" It was my way of thanking mom and dad for not wasting a single penny of the money I earned and saving it well. And for teaching me that you can be happy without money. Now, Jeon Sungguk's life is also upgrading!"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Next, he grabs a soft pretzel, tearing into it with a sense of indulgence, followed by sipping a hot cup of coffee, gazing out the window at the rain-soaked world beyond. Feeling the pull of the day ahead, Erik begins to dress. He slides into a pair of warm, dark blue jeans, each movement deliberate, aware of the day that awaits him. Next, he dons a pair of cherry red leather combat boots, the bold color a stark contrast to the dull weather outside. He adds a green jacket, a stylish yet practical choice against the chill, and wraps a scarf around his neck with a casual elegance. Lastly, he pulls on his favorite pair of leather gloves – a gesture that draws a biting of the lip, a hint of the desires that lie beneath his composed exterior. The final touch is his messenger bag, slung over his shoulder with a practiced ease. He strides to the door, pausing for a moment to face the camera. With a smirk that borders on a promise, he blows a kiss to the viewer, a silent farewell mixed with an invitation for more. [CUT TO: Exterior - Erik's Apartment Building] The apartment door closes with a soft click, and Erik steps out into the rainy day. The scene fades out on the image of Erik, umbrella in hand, disappearing into the misty morning, ready to embrace another day of art, discovery, and perhaps a little bit of longing for that distant American dream.

To clarify, let's discuss the premise and the deduction closely. A function f(x) is said to be smooth if it has derivatives of all orders at each point in its domain. The Taylor series of a smooth function f at a point a is given by: f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + cdots The convergence of a Taylor series of a function depends on two key aspects: 1. **Point of Expansion**: The point a at which the Taylor series is generated. Some functions have Taylor series that converge to the function's value over some interval around a but not necessarily for all x in the function's domain. 2. **Radius of Convergence**: This is the distance from a within which the Taylor series converges to the function. Outside this radius, the series might diverge or not equal the function value even if it converges. Given these points, let's address the question directly: **If a smooth function has a Taylor series at some point that does not converge to the function for all x, does it imply that any other Taylor series of the function also cannot converge to the function everywhere?** The answer is no. The behavior of one Taylor series expansion about a particular point does not necessarily dictate the behavior of another Taylor series expansion about a different point. Specifically: - **Local Nature of Taylor Series**: A Taylor series expansion is inherently a local approximation around a point a. Whether it converges to the actual value of the function outside a neighborhood of a depends on the nature of the function. For one expansion point, the Taylor series might not converge to the function everywhere, but for another point, it might, within its radius of convergence. - **Different Points of Expansion**: It's possible for a smooth function to have a Taylor series at one point that does not converge to the function's value everywhere but has a Taylor series at a different point that does (within a specific range or, in special cases, for all x). - **Analytic Functions**: For functions that are analytic (i.e., they are equal to their Taylor series at every point in their interval of convergence), the Taylor series at any point of expansion will converge to the function within its radius of convergence. Some functions are analytic everywhere (entire functions), such as e^x, sin(x), and cos(x). For these functions, the Taylor series at any point will converge to the function everywhere. **Conclusion**: The convergence properties of a Taylor series are specific to the point of expansion and the characteristics of the function. The fact that a Taylor series for a function does not converge to the function everywhere from one point of expansion does not imply that all Taylor series expansions of the function will behave the same way. It's essential to examine each situation individually, considering the function's properties and the chosen point of expansion."},{"prompt":"Are all power series analytic?","completion":"The relationship between power series and analytic functions is often a source of confusion, so it's important to clarify this with precision. A **power series** is an infinite series of the form: f(x) = sum_{n=0}^{infty} a_n(x - c)^n where a_n represents the coefficients of the series, and c is the center of the series, around which the series is expanded. A function is said to be **analytic** at a point if it can be represented by a power series that converges to the function in some neighborhood of that point. More broadly, a function is analytic on an interval (or domain) if it is represented by a converging power series at every point within the interval. **To answer the question: Are all power series analytic?** Yes, by definition, a power series is analytic at least within its radius of convergence around its center. The radius of convergence (R) is determined by the coefficients a_n and can be calculated using the **ratio test** or **root test** in most cases. The distance from the center (c) to the boundary of this interval of convergence is what we call the radius of convergence. **What happens within and beyond this radius is crucial:** - **Within the Radius of Convergence**: The function represented by the power series is analytic. The series converges to the value of the function at all points within this radius, implying the function is differentiable, and its derivatives can be obtained by differentiating the power series term by term. - **At the Boundary of the Radius**: The behavior of the series can vary. It might converge at some points and diverge at others. Whether the function remains analytic at these boundary points depends on the convergence and representability of the function by the series at those points. - **Beyond the Radius of Convergence**: The series diverges, meaning it cannot represent the function in this region. Consequently, the function is not analytic in these areas based on the power series from the center c. **Key Takeaway**: While all power series are analytic within their radius of convergence, the inverse statement that all analytic functions can be represented as power series is subtly different. An analytic function is one that can be locally represented by a converging power series at any point in its domain. However, the specific power series can vary based on the center point c, and an analytic function can potentially have many different power series representations, each with its own radius of convergence centered around different points in the function's domain."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Implementing ray tracing in Pygame directly for pixel art is non-trivial, as Pygame itself doesn't have built-in support for real ray tracing, which is a computationally intensive technique typically reserved for more powerful game engines and graphics APIs. However, we can emulate a simplified version of light effects and reflections to achieve a visually appealing outcome that resembles your idea. # Step 1: Setting up Pygame First, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install pygame \`\`\` Now, let's create a basic Pygame window where we can draw our pixel art and characters: \`\`\`python import sys import pygame # Initialize Pygame pygame.init() # Window settings screen_width, screen_height = 800, 600 screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height)) pygame.display.set_caption('Pixel Art Game with Light Effects') # Colors BLACK = (0, 0, 0) WHITE = (255, 255, 255) # Game loop running = True while running: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = false # Fill the screen with black screen.fill(BLACK) # Update the display pygame.display.flip() pygame.quit() sys.exit() \`\`\` This code sets up a basic window where your game will run. It's the canvas where we'll draw our game elements. # Step 2: Adding the Main Character Let's add the main character (a white cube) to the center of the screen. \`\`\`python # Main character settings cube_pos = (screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2) cube_size = 20 # Main game loop while running: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: running = False screen.fill(BLACK) # Draw the main character pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, (*cube_pos, cube_size, cube_size)) pygame.display.flip() \`\`\` # Step 3: Simulating Light Here's where we get creative. Since implementing real ray tracing is beyond the scope of Pygame and would require extensive computational resources, we'll simulate the effect of light spreading out from the cube and reflecting off surfaces. One way to achieve this is by using gradients of white to lighter shades of grey to emulate light fading. Actual ray tracing for reflections and advanced lighting would typically be done in a shader program in more advanced graphics libraries. For simple light simulation, consider this approach: 1. Draw lines or cones of light spreading out from the character, reducing the intensity as it goes further. 2. Create simple \\"reflective\\" surfaces that can bounce the light in a different direction. Implementing a fully realistic light system with reflections is complex and outside the immediate scope of a short guide. A more detailed project might involve studying light physics, linear algebra, and more advanced graphics programming. # Moving Forward To proceed, you might want to dive deeper into learning how games are developed, the math behind ray tracing, and perhaps consider moving to a game engine more suited to 3D graphics and complex lighting, like Unity or Unreal Engine, for full ray tracing capabilities. Pygame is fantastic for learning and 2D games but has its limitations with advanced graphics effects. Remember, development is an iterative process. Start simple, gradually add features, and don't hesitate to revise your goals as you learn more about what's possible within your chosen tools and platforms."},{"prompt":"let's complete the rest of the project, Next up: simulating light, game scoring logic (You can choose what to do), input, menu","completion":"Let's further develop the game by focusing on simulating light in a simplified manner, adding input handling for player movement, introducing a basic game scoring logic, and creating a simple menu.

Here are a few observations and improvements that can further refine your game: 1. **AI Boundary Check**: Similar to the player's character, the AI's movement should also be restricted within the game window to prevent it from moving outside the visible area. 2. **Better AI Target Update**: To make the game more dynamic, the AI's target (the light orb) could be updated less predictably, adding more randomness or strategy to its movements. 3. **Game State Management**: As your game grows in complexity, consider implementing a game state management system to handle different parts of your game, such as the menu, the main gameplay loop, and a game over screen. Here’s how to implement the AI boundary check similar to the player's character: \`\`\`python # Enforce window boundaries for the AI ai_pos = ( max(min(ai_pos[0], screen_width - ai_size), 0), max(min(ai_pos[1], screen_height - ai_size), 0) ) \`\`\` Add this snippet right after updating \`ai_pos = move_towards(ai_pos, light_orb, ai_speed)\` inside the game loop to ensure the AI character stays within the screen bounds. # Additional Improvements: - **Game Difficulty**: Introduce levels or increase the speed of the AI as the player's score increases to make the game more challenging. - **AI Intelligence**: Implement a more sophisticated algorithm for the AI's movement, perhaps using pathfinding algorithms like A* to calculate the shortest path to the orb, making it more challenging for the player. - **Visual and Audio Feedback**: Consider adding visual effects or sounds when the orb is collected, or when the AI or player scores, to enhance the gaming experience. - **Game Over Condition**: Introduce a game over condition, such as a time limit or a maximum score, followed by a game over screen that displays the final scores and offers the player an option to restart the game. Your code does a good job of setting up the basic mechanics and opens up a lot of possibilities for expansion. Developing games is an iterative process; you've laid a solid foundation, and there’s ample room for creativity and improvement as you continue. Keep experimenting with new ideas, and don't hesitate to seek out resources or communities for game development for inspiration and support!"},{"prompt":"There is an issue with the game, the player size is too big, even tough i did change its value, it still appears to be big, and also, when the player touches the light, it doen't register as a score, after fixing these issues, we'll add all of the \\"additional improvements\\"","completion":"It seems like you're facing two separate issues: 1. The player's character size not changing as expected. 2. The collision detection with the light orb not working correctly, thus not registering a score. Let's address these problems: # Issue 1: Player's Character Size If changing the \`cube_size\` variable doesn't affect the perceived size of your player character, it's important to ensure that the drawing commands use this variable correctly and it's correctly updated before being drawn. - Verify that \`cube_size\` is correctly applied where you draw the character. - Ensure that there's no hard-coded value in the \`pygame.draw.rect\` function for the player character that overrides \`cube_size\`. Your player drawing code seems correct, so if the size appears too big, double-check that the value of \`cube_size\` is being set to what you expect early enough in your code, and it’s not being inadvertently modified elsewhere before the drawing occurs. # Issue 2: Collision Detection and Scoring The scoring issue might stem from the collision detection logic. You're using the \`collidepoint\` method, which checks if a point is within the rectangle defined for the light orb. This is generally correct, but issues might arise from: - The \`cube_pos\` and \`ai_pos\` might need to define the center of the characters, but when creating the \`cube_rect\` and using \`collidepoint\`, you should ensure the positions align correctly with how you expect collisions to occur. - Ensure the \`orb_rect\` is correctly sized and positioned around the light orb. To make sure collisions are detected accurately, let's verify the collision detection: \`\`\`python orb_rect = pygame.Rect(light_orb[0] - 5, light_orb[1] - 5, 10, 10) # Correctly creates a small area around the orb cube_rect = pygame.Rect(cube_pos[0], cube_pos[1], cube_size, cube_size) # This defines the area of your player # Now, instead of using collidepoint (since it checks for point, not rect collision), let's use colliderect if cube_rect.colliderect(orb_rect): player_score += 1 light_orb = (random.randint(0, screen_width), random.randint(0, screen_height)) print(\\"Player Score:\\", player_score) # For debugging. \`\`\` You should apply a similar logic to AI collision detection. # Collision Detection Tip: Given the nature of your game, ensuring that the collision detection suits the gameplay is crucial. You're using rectangles for collision which is perfectly fine for a starter. However, if your characters or orbs are not rectangular, consider adjusting the collision detection logic to better suit their shapes or use more precise methods (e.g., circle collision detection if your entities are better represented as circles). # After Fixing: Once these issues are resolved, and the game functions as expected, implementing the additional improvements can proceed. Each of those improvements, like game difficulty adjustments, enhanced AI, visual/audio feedback, and a game over condition, would significantly enhance the gameplay experience.

To ensure that the gradient is centered on your player or light orbs, you'll want to adjust the position you're passing to the \`draw_gradient_light\` function to account for this. Given that \`cube_size\` and \`ai_size\` determine the dimensions of your player and AI rects, you can adjust the position accordingly: \`\`\`python player_center_pos = (cube_pos[0] + cube_size / 2, cube_pos[1] + cube_size / 2) light_orb_center_pos = (light_orb[0], light_orb[1]) # Assuming light_orb is already centered \`\`\` # Correcting the Gradient Effect To ensure the gradient emanates properly from the center without creating a donut effect, we want to ensure that the color interpolation and alpha blending are appropriately handled.

Let's refine the \`draw_gradient_light\` function considering these adjustments: \`\`\`python def draw_gradient_light(screen, position, max_radius, start_color, end_color): for radius in range(max_radius, 0, -1): # More fine-grained stepping alpha = int(255 * (radius / max_radius)) color = [ int(start_color[i] + (end_color[i] - start_color[i]) * (radius / max_radius)) for i in range(3) ] # Ensuring position adjustment so the gradient is centered pos_adjusted = (position[0] - radius, position[1] - radius) temp_surface = pygame.Surface((2 * radius, 2 * radius), pygame.SRCALPHA) pygame.draw.circle(temp_surface, (*color, alpha), (radius, radius), radius) screen.blit(temp_surface, pos_adjusted) \`\`\` # Using the Corrected Function When drawing the light aura around the player or the orbs, make sure to use the center position: \`\`\`python # For the player's light aura with corrected centering draw_gradient_light(screen, player_center_pos, 100, BLACK, WHITE) # For a respawning light orb with corrected centering draw_gradient_light(screen, light_orb_center_pos, 50, BLACK, YELLOW) \`\`\` # Final Touches This should properly center the gradients on your entities and fix the issue where the gradient looked more like a donut. This more granular stepping (changing the range step to \`-1\`) and ensuring that the alpha blending starts fully opaque at the center should give a more pleasing gradient effect.

If, however, the light effects remain unaligned with the expectations, revisiting the gradient drawing functions might be necessary. The noted behavior can be attributed to the re-calculation and updating of position points being within the game loop. It seems you've already integrated re-calculation of center points for both player and light orb within the loop, ensuring their current positions are considered when drawing the light effects. If the light effects still seem misaligned or reversed, it could be due to how the alpha and color blending is handled within the \`draw_player_light\` and \`draw_orb_light\` functions. A direct approach to ensuring the light emanates from the center outwards, with appropriate colors and blending, involves revising the alpha blending logic—specifically, reversing how the alpha and color gradient are applied. Considering this, let's ensure the functions properly update gradients with movement, and the gradients are correctly being drawn from the center outward: # Potential Adjustments: 1. **Ensure the center positions are calculated right before drawing the gradients** — This part is correctly handled in your game loop as per your code snippet. 2. **Revisit Alpha and Color Blending Logic** — It seems like you intend for a solid, bright center that fades out. This logic essentially requires the innermost iterations to be more opaque and potentially a solid color, gradually adjusting to become transparent or blend towards the background color. Your existing approach adjusts the radius and alpha appropriately; however, to better align with the desired effect, ensuring the gradient starts bright and solid at the center (brightest and most opaque) and then fades outwards might need revisiting the calculation of \`alpha\` and \`color\` values, closely examining the decrement of alpha (it seems correct but ensuring it aligns with visual expectations is key). 3. **Debugging Drawing Positions** — If the gradient isn't aligning, consider drawing a simple colored rectangle or circle at the \`player_center_pos\` and \`orb_center_pos\` without any gradient to verify the positions are indeed centered correctly atop your entities. This can help validate that the position calculations are accurate and not offset: \`\`\`python # Debug position alignment pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0, 255, 0), player_center_pos, 10) # Draw a simple circle at the player center pygame.draw.circle(screen, (0, 0, 255), orb_center_pos, 10) # Draw a simple circle at the orb center \`\`\` Incorporate these checks before invoking gradient functions to visually confirm positions. # Debugging Suggestions: - **Verify Position Calculations**: Given your approach seems logically sound, directly rendering simple shapes at calculated centers can help isolate if the misalignment issue stems from calculation or gradient rendering. - **Adjust Gradient Logic if needed**: Based on how your game visuals update, if the gradient still appears reversed or incorrectly aligned, further tweak the alpha blending logic or consider introducing condition checks that align with the movement or relocation logic within the game loop. By ensuring these adjustments and debugging steps, you should be able to better align the visual effects with the game's dynamic movements and interactions."},{"prompt":"now that the game runs perfectly, what are the things that we should consider first: New menu with a lot of controls and slider, Using modernGL for adding shaders, code optimization","completion":"Once your game runs smoothly as expected, turning your attention to enhancements and optimizations can greatly improve the overall quality and playability of your game. Here's how to prioritize your next steps: # 1. New Menu with Controls and Sliders Introducing a more advanced menu system can significantly enhance the player's experience by providing more control over the game settings. Consider the following when developing your new menu: - **User Experience (UX)**: A clean, intuitive UI/UX is crucial. Ensure that the controls are easy to understand and use. - **Settings Customization**: Offer players control over common settings like sound volume, music volume, difficulty levels, and screen resolution, if applicable. - **Accessibility Features**: Include options that make your game more accessible to a broader audience, such as colorblind modes or adjustable text sizes. - **Saving and Loading**: If your game state needs to be saved, ensure there’s an easy-to-navigate section for saving and loading game states. # Toolkit Suggestions: For implementing sophisticated UI elements in Pygame, consider leveraging libraries such as \`pygame-menu\` that allow creating menus with various controls, including sliders. # 2. Using modernGL for Adding Shaders Adding shaders can dramatically enhance the visual appeal of your game through effects like lighting, shadows, and post-processing. ModernGL or similar OpenGL wrappers can help introduce these advanced graphics effects into your game. Consider the following: - **Learn Shading Language**: Understanding GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) is essential for writing your shaders. - **Performance Implications**: Shaders can be performance-intensive. Ensure your implementation is optimized and test on various hardware. - **Compatibility**: Ensure your usage of ModernGL or any graphics library doesn't introduce compatibility issues across different players' systems. # Recommended Steps: - **Start Small**: Begin by implementing simple shaders, like a dynamic lighting effect or a basic color grading shader, before moving on to more complex shaders. - **Study Examples**: Look at shader examples and tutorials specific to 2D games to understand how they enhance the game visuals. # 3. Code Optimization Optimizing your game's code is critical for ensuring smooth gameplay, especially as you start adding more features. Here’s what to focus on: - **Profiling**: Use Python’s profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in your game loop or any functions that are particularly performance-heavy. - **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Ensure that the algorithms used for game logic, pathfinding, AI, etc., are as efficient as possible. - **Memory Management**: Monitor your game's memory usage, especially if your game involves lots of assets or dynamic object creation and destruction. - **Pygame Specific Optimizations**: Techniques like using \`pygame.sprite.Group\` for efficient rendering of many sprites, or managing events and updates intelligently, can help maintain smooth frame rates. # Recommended Approaches: - **Incremental Optimizations**: Make small, incremental changes and measure their impact on performance to understand what works best. - **Community Feedback**: Engage with developer communities on platforms like GitHub, Reddit, or Stack Overflow for specific advice on optimizing pygame or ModernGL applications. # Conclusion While enhancing menus and introducing shaders can significantly benefit the game's feel and aesthetics, ensuring the game is well-optimized is foundational to providing a smooth player experience.

Here's a quick overview of how this works: - \`draw_text\`: A helper function to simplify drawing text. - \`main_menu\`: The main menu screen with buttons to either start the game or navigate to the options screen. It also displays the game's title and developer name. - \`game\` and \`options\`: Placeholder functions for the game and the options page. For now, they just display a simple message and allow returning to the main menu by pressing the ESC key. You'll need to replace the placeholders and text with your actual game startup logic and options menu. This code provides a basic, functional starting point for building a more complex menu system as your game develops."},{"prompt":"I want a full implementation, if splitting the code into multiple files is necessary, specify which code goes to which file, if you fear the limit of the platform, don't worry, you can split you code generation into multiple snippets","completion":"For a complete implementation of a menu system in a Pygame project that involves multiple pages (e.g., a main menu, options menu), we will structure the code into multiple files for better organization and readability. This approach enhances maintainability, especially as the complexity of your game increases.

Implement buttons the same way you would for the main menu, and possibly introduce sliders or toggles for different settings. - **Transitions Between States**: Enhance the \`update()\` method to handle transitions between different parts of the menu, including going back to the main menu from options or quitting the game. Please note, this code is designed for clarity and simplicity and might require adjustments and additions based on your specific game requirements, such as adding actual game-start logic, more complex menu interactions, and saving/loading settings."},{"prompt":"now that i created the files and added the code to each of them, i still have a file containing the original code for the game, the file name is OG, what should i do with it ?","completion":"Integrating your original game code (\`OG\` file) with the new menu system requires a thoughtful approach to ensure seamless transition between menus and game states. Here's a structured method to incorporate your game logic into the new structure: # 1. **Identify Core Game Logic** First, review your original game code (\`OG\`). Identify the core components that constitute the game loop, initialization routines, and any cleanup or exit procedures. This likely includes: - Game initialization (loading assets, setting up the game state) - Main game loop (handling events, updating game state, rendering) - Cleanup or transition to other states (e.g., going back to the main menu, saving game progress) # 2. **Integrate with the New Structure** Create a new file, or use an existing one that's meant to contain the main game logic, something like \`game.py\`. Refactor the identified core components into a class or a set of functions in this file. The structure might look something like this: \`\`\`python # game.py import pygame from settings import * class Game: def __init__(self, screen): self.screen = screen self.running = True # Additional game-specific initializations def event_handler(self): for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == pygame.QUIT: self.running = False # Additional event handling def update(self): # Update game state def draw(self): self.screen.fill(BLACK) # Additional game rendering def run(self): while self.running: self.event_handler() self.update() self.draw() pygame.display.flip() # Timer or clock tick, if necessary # This function allows the game to be launched from here or integrated elsewhere def play_game(screen): game_instance = Game(screen) game_instance.run() \`\`\` # 3. **Launch Game from the Menu** In your \`menu.py\` file, import the game module and launch it when necessary. For example, in the \`Menu\` class, add a method to switch to the game state, which effectively runs the game. First, make sure to import your \`Game\` class at the top of the \`menu.py\`: \`\`\`python from game import play_game \`\`\` Then, add a method in your \`Menu\` class to handle switching to the game: \`\`\`python class Menu: # Other methods def play_game(self): play_game(self.screen) self.state = \\"main\\" # Return to main menu after the game ends \`\`\` Invoke \`self.play_game()\` from the menu's update method when the \\"Play\\" button is clicked. This effectively transitions from the menu state to the game. # 4. **Adapt as Necessary** Depending on your original game's complexity, you may need to adapt this method. For instance, if your game includes pausing or needs to return to the menu, ensure those transitions are smoothly handled within the \`Game\` class by manipulating \`self.running\` or implementing pause menus. # 5. **Test and Refine** After integrating the original game with the menu system, thoroughly test the transitions between different game states and menus. Ensure that starting the game, returning to the menu, accessing options, and exiting work as intended. # Conclusion This method ensures your original game logic is preserved and neatly packaged into an object-oriented approach that works seamlessly with your new menu systems. It offers flexibility for further expansion, like adding new menus, game states, or even integrating save/load functionality."},{"prompt":"This is the content of the OG.py file: import pygame import random import math import sys # Initialize Pygame pygame.init() # Window settings screen_width, screen_height = 1280, 720 screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height)) pygame.display.set_caption('Pixel Art Game with Light Effects') # Colors BLACK = (0, 0, 0) WHITE = (255, 255, 255) YELLOW = (255, 255, 0) # Main character settings cube_pos = [screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2] cube_size = 20 # Adjust if too small/big cube_speed = 2 # Define running variable running = True # Generate a single light orb initially light_orb = (random.randint(0, screen_width), random.randint(0, screen_height)) # Center of shapes player_center_pos = (cube_pos[0] + cube_size / 2, cube_pos[1] + cube_size / 2) light_orb_center_pos = (light_orb[0], light_orb[1]) # Assuming light_orb is already centered # Player and AI scores player_score = 0 ai_score = 0 # Define the AI character settings ai_pos = [random.randint(0, screen_width), random.randint(0, screen_height)] # Changed to list ai_size = 20 # Unified size with player for fairness ai_speed = 0.1 font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 24) def draw_scores(screen, player_score, ai_score): score_text = font.render(f'Player: {player_score} | AI: {ai_score}', True, WHITE) screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10)) # This function moves the AI towards the target (light orb) def move_towards(ai_pos, target_pos, speed): dx, dy = target_pos[0] -

Given your current setup, there are some adjustments and best practices you might want to consider to encapsulate the logic more neatly and ensure the class interfaces cleanly with the rest of your game: # Refactoring for Better Structure and Encapsulation 1. **Internalize Utility Functions**: Move \`draw_scores\`, \`move_towards\`, \`draw_player_light\`, and \`draw_orb_light\` into the \`Game\` class as methods. This encapsulation ensures that all functionalities related to the game are self-contained within the \`Game\` class. 2. **Use of Instance Variables**: For values that are reused or accessed across different methods within the \`Game\` class, such as \`font\`, ensure you're referring to them as instance attributes (e.g., \`self.font\`). This approach maintains consistency and prevents issues related to variable scope. 3. **Initialization of Pygame Components**: Pygame components like fonts or images often used within your game methods should be initialized within the \`__init__\` method of the \`Game\` class or a dedicated initializer method to ensure they're ready before your game tries to use them. # Example of Refactoring: Here's a quick refactor of integrating the utility functions into the \`Game\` class: \`\`\`python class Game: def __init__(self, screen): self.screen = screen self.running = False self.font = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 24) # Initialize other attributes... def draw_scores(self, player_score, ai_score): score_text = self.font.render(f'Player: {player_score} | AI: {ai_score}', True, WHITE) self.screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10)) def move_towards(self, ai_pos, target_pos, speed): dx, dy = target_pos[0] - ai_pos[0], target_pos[1] - ai_pos[1] dist = max(math.sqrt(dx ** 2 + dy ** 2), 1) move_dx, move_dy = dx / dist * speed, dy / dist * speed return [ai_pos[0] + move_dx, ai_pos[1] + move_dy] def draw_player_light(self, position, max_radius): # The implementation of draw_player_light... pass def draw_orb_light(self, position, max_radius): # The implementation of draw_orb_light... pass def run(self): self.running = True while self.running: # Your main game loop logic, calling self.draw_scores, self.move_towards, etc. pass \`\`\` # Integrating with Main and Menu System: - Ensure the \`menu.py\` is updated to create and start a \`Game\` instance in a manner similar to my previous instructions. - In \`main.py\`, the primary loop should be responsible for initializing Pygame and setting up the main screen before handing control off to either the \`Menu\` system or directly to the \`Game\` depending on how you want your game flow structured. # Conclusion: By encapsulating game-related functionalities within the \`Game\` class, you create a cleaner, more maintainable codebase that logically separates the concerns of game logic from menu navigation and other aspects of your game's infrastructure. Remember, Python classes offer a powerful way to bundle data and functionality together.

This typically involves creating an instance of the \`Game\` class and triggering its \`.run()\` method within your main script (e.g., \`main.py\`). Here’s how you could set up your testing environment: # Step 1: Ensure Pygame is Installed First, make sure Pygame is installed in your Python environment. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip: \`\`\` pip install pygame \`\`\` # Step 2: Set Up \`main.py\` Create a \`main.py\` file (if you haven’t already) that will serve as the entry point to your game. This file should initialize Pygame, set up the screen, and manage the main loop (though the main game loop is handled within \`Game.run\`). \`\`\`python # main.py import pygame from game import Game from settings import SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT def main(): # Initialize Pygame pygame.init() # Set up the display screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT)) pygame.display.set_caption(\\"Game Title\\") # Initialize and run the game game_instance = Game(screen) game_instance.run() pygame.quit() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() \`\`\` Make sure to adjust \`\\"Game Title\\"\` to whatever you want your game's window title to be. # Step 3: Running Your Game After setting up \`main.py\`, you can test your game simply by running this script: \`\`\` python main.py \`\`\` This command starts your Python application, thereby initializing Pygame, setting up the display based on your screen settings, and kicking off your game logic encapsulated in the \`Game\` class. # Additional Recommendations: - **Debug Prints**: Initially, add \`print\` statements in crucial parts of your \`Game.run()\` method or event handlers to ensure your game loop starts correctly and events (like player inputs) are being captured. - **Basic Test Cases**: Implement rudimentary test cases, such as ensuring the player character moves as intended, AI behavior works, score increments, and transition back to menu (if applicable). - **Iterative Testing**: Test features individually as you develop them. Starting with a complex system without ensuring the foundational elements work can make debugging difficult. # Final Notes: Testing is an iterative process. Begin with confirming the basic functionalities, and then move on to test more complex interactions and game states. Pay attention to performance, looking out for any unusual CPU or memory usage that might indicate inefficiencies in your game loop or rendering logic. Congratulations on getting to this stage of your game development! Testing not only helps ensure your game functions as expected, but it can also provide insights into improvements and adjustments to enhance gameplay experience."},{"prompt":"If everyone went coma","completion":"If everyone suddenly went into a coma, the consequences would be catastrophic across multiple levels. Such an unprecedented event would severely impact every aspect of human civilization, ecosystems, and the balance of life on earth. Here’s a breakdown of what would ensue: # Short-term Effects 1. **Power Outages**: Without humans to manage and maintain power plants and electricity grids, most power generation would cease within hours to a few days. Nuclear power plants would shut down into safe modes, and renewable energy sources like wind and solar panels would continue functioning until they encountered a fault or required maintenance. 2. **Fires and Explosions**: With nobody to control them, fires in homes, industries, and forests would spread uncontrolled. Gas leaks, unattended cooking appliances, and industrial accidents could lead to explosions. 3. **Water and Food**: The supply of clean water would stop as treatment plants fail. With no one to maintain or operate the infrastructure, water contamination would become widespread. Perishable food would spoil in a matter of days. 4. **Pets and Livestock**: Domestic animals trapped indoors would die from starvation or dehydration. Livestock would face a similar fate, though some might escape and fend for themselves temporarily. 5. **Transport and Communication**: Vehicles would stop in place, leading to potential accidents and blockages. Communication networks would begin to fail as power sources drain. # Medium-term Effects 1. **Nuclear Facilities**: Although designed with numerous safety protocols, the lack of human oversight could lead to failures in cooling systems over weeks or months, potentially causing leaks or disasters. 2. **Decay of Infrastructure**: Without maintenance, buildings, roads, and bridges would begin to decay more rapidly, especially in areas prone to natural disasters or extreme weather. 3. **Environmental Impact**: The immediate halt in industrial activities would reduce pollution temporarily. However, the long-term neglect of environmental management and containment systems (e.g., for radioactive materials, chemical waste) could lead to significant pollution and ecological damage. # Long-term Effects 1. **Nature Reclaims**: In the absence of human activity, wildlife would begin to reclaim urban areas. Plants would overgrow, and some animal populations would flourish while others, dependent on human-managed habitats, might struggle or go extinct. 2. **Global Cooling**: The significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could lead to a cooling of the planet. However, the unmanaged release of some pollutants and greenhouse gases from industrial sites might counteract this effect partially. 3. **Collapse of Human Culture**: Without humans, all intangible aspects of human culture—languages, traditions, knowledge—would vanish. The tangible remains of human civilization, such as buildings and art, would gradually decay. # Biological Impact Upon waking from the coma, if that were possible, humans would face a world profoundly changed. Infrastructure collapse, loss of knowledge on operating complex systems, widespread disease from decaying bodies and lack of clean water, and drastic ecological shifts would pose immense survival challenges. In summary, a scenario where everyone went into a coma simultaneously highlights the intricate interdependence between humans and the systems we’ve built, as well as our relationship with the natural world. The resilience of human-made systems without us is limited, and the repercussions of such an event would alter the planet in ways that are difficult to fully comprehend."},{"prompt":"Write really overly-funny superhilarious comedy 17+ scooby-doo transcript based on my prompt: (but make it more funnier comedy) Fred, Daphne, Velma, Scooby and Shaggy head to New England to visit Shaggy's uncle, Shagworthy. On the way, they stop at a magician's (Zarko), magic show. He invites Shaggy and Scooby up onto stage and \\"saws them in half\\" the old magic box trick. However, Shaggy and Scooby get so scared at this trick that they run while the other half runs the other way. Both halves of the box crash and the audience boos. Zarko gets mad at Scooby and Shaggy for ruining his act and they run away. The gang leaves and head for Uncle Shagworthy's castle. Upon arrival, they are greeted by a man named Clarence who says he is the caretaker and warns them away from the castle. He explains when Shagworthy bought the castle, the Curse of Camelot came along with it. The caretaker tells Mystery Inc. that the castle is haunted by Merlin the wizard and his evil slave, the Black Knight. He also tells them that Shagworthy has gone missing. Soon after, Merlin and the Black Knight appears, warns the kids away, and kidnaps the caretaker. The five sleuths enter the castle and begin looking for Shagworthy. They begin walking through the winding corridors. The Black Knight appears, and the gang runs into a secret room with a replica of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in it. All of a sudden, flying ghostly figures rise up from the knight statues and chase the gang. Shaggy and Scooby get caught by Merlin and the Knight and get hypnotized to dispose of Fred, Daphne and Velma. Meanwhile, Fred, Velma and Daphne hide in the library where they find signs of a struggle, and a red silk scarf. Shaggy and Scooby try dropping a chandelier on Fred and the girls but it backfires, and Fred, Daphne and Velma manage to get them out of their trance with Scooby Snacks. Scooby or Shaggy has no memory of the events. The gang keeps looking for Shagworthy through the spooky castle. They go down into the dungeon where they find Shagworthy chained up on the wall. Shagworthy explains that Merlin and the knight started appearing in the castle every night at 12:15. The gang is puzzled at the odd time, though they continue looking for clues. They go to the treasure room to find it has been ransacked. Before they can go any further, the flying ghost knights appear and chase Fred, Daphne and Velma. Scooby and Shaggy are pursued by the Knight and Merlin. They fool them by pretending to be corny salesman, and then hide in suits of armor. Fred, Daphne and Velma hide in the music room, where they hear the Knight approaching. They trap him, to find it was Scooby and Shaggy in the knight costume. The gang searches the tower and finds an electronic organ. Velma is starting to piece the puzzle together. Now, all they have to do is trap the wizard and his tin friend. Scooby and Shaggy act as bait, and lure the two ghosts to their trap, but it backfires and Scooby and Shaggy flee, but manage to trap Merlin and the Knight in a woven tapestry. Merlin is unmasked as Clarence the caretaker and the Knight is unmasked as a hired henchman. But Velma isn't so sure; as Fred pulls off a rubber mask to reveal the caretaker was a disguise; Zarko is the culprit! He disguised himself as the caretaker. Mystery Inc. explains it all. Their first clue was when the knight carried the caretaker off through a wall, revealed by Velma to be a common magician trick. The silk scarf was a common tool used by magicians for some tricks. All of the flying ghost knights were controlled by pushing keys on the organ; they were just magician illusions. Zarko wanted to scare everyone off so he could search for Shagworthy's jewels. Also, Shagworthy told them about Merlin appearing at 12:15. Zarko's show ended at midnight and it took 15 minutes to get to the castle.

Fred, Scooby and Shaggy hurry to the garage and freed them just before running into the two men who are the owners of the factory, Mr. Dilly and Mr. Dally. After hearing the gang's story, Mr. Dilly and Mr. Dally instructs them to stay in the office while they search for the zombie. Mr. Dilly and the watchman begin searching and Mr. Dally is grabbed by the No-Face Zombie. Inside the office, Velma finds a magazine with three pages torn out, their first clue. Then, the No-Face Zombie attacks Scooby and the gang, but they manage to swipe the Golden Galleon and flee from the zombie. When they make a run for it, they discover another villain-a giant gorilla is now after the gang! Scooby and Shaggy run into the cafeteria and have a run-in with the popcorn machine. After they've escaped the goons, they phone the police and he tells them they will have to wait there to wait for the lieutenant to arrive. The gorilla and the zombie make an appearance again and chases them all. In the process, the zombie swipes the galleon. They are chased around some more, and while running, Scooby tumbles into a duplication machine and gets multiplied. After being found in a room full of multiple dogs, Scooby joins Shaggy outside to find a newsstand and get another copy of the magazine that Velma found, to see which pages were torn out. But the gorilla appears and chases them back to the factory. Meanwhile, Velma, Fred and Daphne manage to steal the coin back from the zombie. The lieutenant, Scooby and Shaggy arrive at the factory and run into Fred and the girls. But the zombie appears and takes the golden galleon again. After a short chase, they crash into the zombie and discover that it was a computerized robot. The gorilla appears and swipes the coin, and tries to make a getaway, but Shaggy and Scooby act fast and trap him. The gorilla is unmasked as Mr. Dilly. He read about the coin article in that magazine and programmed that robot to steal the coin because it was worth a million dollars. Then when the gang was onto him, he donned the gorilla costume to scare them off, and had Mr. Dally and the night watchman locked in the storeroom. As a reward, Mr. Dally opens up the factory cafeteria. However, when Shaggy and Scooby order some burgers, Dally reveals they're all gone as the duplicates of Scooby ate them all.","completion":"**Title: Scooby-Doo and the Case of the Gourmet Galleon** **[Scene: The gang is in a sandwich shop next door to a coin store.]** **Shaggy:** Like, Scooby, you sure that's enough sandwiches to tide you over? **Scooby:** Ruh-huh, Shaggy! *[Sudden crash from next door.

While the band performs one of their new songs, titled \\"Mamba Wamba\\", an ancient shaman appears, telling them they have violated a sacred chant by playing the song. With a cloud of smoke, he disappears, taking the band's solo female member Lila. The gang decides to help Super find Lila by heading to Maison Dupree, the plantation Lila grew up on. There, they discover voodoo dolls of all the members of Super, including their manager, Roger. While they're searching for clues, a zombie appears to chase Shaggy and Scooby. After all of the band members disappear one by one, it's up to the gang to save them and Lila. After a failed attempt at catching Mamba Wamba, the gang decides to split up once more. Shaggy and Scooby are chased by the zombie outside and take refuge in a grass field. After they lost the zombie, they heard thumping in a nearby log, which they believe is Mamba Wamba inside, but it turned out a frog was inside. They then the hear voodoo drums in the distance and attempted to run away from them, (with the frog hitch-hiking with them) but ended up on top of a hut. While hiding, they discover they're in Mamba Wamba's lair, where they see Alex, Ray and Deek being held hostage. They also discover that Lila has in fact been turned into a zombie. Mamba Wamba promises Alex, Ray and Deek the same fate as Lila, unless they sign a parchment vowing to never play the sacred chant again. Alex signs the parchment, just as Scooby and Shaggy give away their hiding places. The frog then steals the parchment with Shaggy, Scooby, Mamba Wamba, the zombie, and Lila pursuing it. Shaggy and Scooby escaped, giving the parchment to Fred, Daphne and Velma, who recognize it as the final clue. They devise a trap in order to catch Mamba Wamba. After capturing them in a net, the gang calls the police to unveil what's been happening. It turns out Roger was Mamba Wamba, Lila played herself as a zombie, and the other zombie is an unknown henchman. Both Roger and Lila realized that the song, Mamba Wamba was worth millions. So they devised a scheme to scare the band out of their rights to the money. The paper that Alex signed was actually a legal release with a fake parchment glued above their signatures.

Below is the modified version of the previous example, combining all the parts into a single HTML file: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Auto Refresh Example</title> <style> body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh; background-color: #f0f0f0; } .container { text-align: center; background-color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); } #time { font-size: 24px; margin-top: 20px; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=\\"container\\"> <h1>Current Time</h1> <div id=\\"time\\">--:--:--</div> </div> <script> function updateTime() { const now = new Date(); document.getElementById('time').textContent = now.toLocaleTimeString(); } document.addEventListener(\\"DOMContentLoaded\\", function() { updateTime(); // Update time immediately on load setInterval(updateTime, 10000); // Then update every 10 seconds }); <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` **Explanation**: - The \`<style>\` tag placed within the \`<head>\` section contains the CSS styles previously described in the external stylesheet. This directly styles elements on the page without needing a separate file. - The \`<script>\` tag, located before the closing \`</body>\` tag, holds the JavaScript code responsible for updating the time display. Writing the script here ensures it runs after the HTML document's elements are loaded, allowing it to interact with the DOM properly. By combining CSS and JavaScript within your HTML file this way, you achieve a compact, all-in-one solution for simple projects or examples without the need for multiple files. This can be especially useful for quick prototypes, small projects, or embedding code in platforms that support HTML content."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Sutton published a blog post titled \\"The Bitter Lesson\\" in March 2019, although the ideas it contains have been relevant in the field for many decades. The central thesis of the \\"bitter lesson\\" is that the most significant advancements in the performance of AI systems over the years have come from increases in computational power and the use of general methods that leverage this power, rather than from more human-specific insights or intricately designed algorithms that incorporate human understanding of the problem space. Sutton argues that time and again, approaches that try to hard-code human knowledge or expertise into AI systems have been outperformed by approaches that rely on simple but general algorithms, given enough computational power and data. This lesson is considered \\"bitter\\" because it challenges the notion that human expertise and domain-specific knowledge can be directly encoded into AI systems to improve their performance. Instead, it suggests that the path to more powerful AI lies primarily in leveraging more computation and more data to allow the systems to learn for themselves, even if the algorithms they use are relatively simple or general. Sutton's observation has implications for how AI research is conducted and where resources might be best allocated. It suggests a focus on scalable architectures, large datasets, and the computational power needed to process them, rather than on crafting sophisticated, hand-tuned algorithms based on human intuition. The \\"bitter lesson\\" has sparked considerable debate within the AI community about the best paths forward for research and development, the role of human knowledge in AI, and how best to achieve more general or \\"strong\\" forms of artificial intelligence.

With a cloud of smoke, he disappears, taking the band’s solo female member Lila. The gang decides to help Super find Lila by heading to Maison Dupree, the plantation Lila grew up on. There, they discover voodoo dolls of all the members of Super, including their manager, Roger. While they’re searching for clues, a zombie appears to chase Shaggy and Scooby. After all of the band members disappear one by one, it’s up to the gang to save them and Lila. After a failed attempt at catching Mamba Wamba, the gang decides to split up once more. Shaggy and Scooby are chased by the zombie outside and take refuge in a grass field. After they lost the zombie, they heard thumping in a nearby log, which they believe is Mamba Wamba inside, but it turned out a frog was inside. They then the hear voodoo drums in the distance and attempted to run away from them, (with the frog hitch-hiking with them) but ended up on top of a hut. While hiding, they discover they’re in Mamba Wamba’s lair, where they see Alex, Ray and Deek being held hostage. They also discover that Lila has in fact been turned into a zombie. Mamba Wamba promises Alex, Ray and Deek the same fate as Lila, unless they sign a parchment vowing to never play the sacred chant again. Alex signs the parchment, just as Scooby and Shaggy give away their hiding places. The frog then steals the parchment with Shaggy, Scooby, Mamba Wamba, the zombie, and Lila pursuing it. Shaggy and Scooby escaped, giving the parchment to Fred, Daphne and Velma, who recognize it as the final clue. They devise a trap in order to catch Mamba Wamba.

[가만있어.] “혀엉!” [가만있으라고 형이 그랬다.] “으응.” 민국이는 입을 살짝 내밀고는 고개를 끄덕였다. 다행히 전태국과 달리 인성은 올발랐다. 형인 내 말도 잘 들었다. 이 녀석은 아무래도 내가 길들여볼 만할 것 같았다. 김미영이 다가오더니 내 손을 스윽 잡았다. “제가 성국이랑 민국이 보고 있을게요.” 엄마는 미안한 얼굴로 지갑에서 만 원짜리 몇 장을 내밀었다. “언니, 성국이가 요즘 그림책이나 동화책에 관심 많거든요. 근처 서점 가서 책 좀 사주시고, 점심 맛있는 거 드세요. 매번 이렇게 신세 져서 너무 죄송해요.” “우리는 파트너잖아요.” “파트너인데, 제가 항상 더 도움 받는 거 같거든요.” “나야말로 성국이 덕분에 새 직장 생긴 건데요. 그리고 나 성국이 매니저잖아요. 이게 일이죠. 암튼, 성국이랑 민국이, 이사할 동안 제가 볼게요.” 김미영은 어쩔 수 없이 엄마가 내민 돈을 받아 들었다. 그러곤 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 그림책 보러 갈까?” “조아요!” 나는 흔쾌히 대답했다. 요즘이야 다섯 살 아이가 한글을 읽는 게 별 대수롭지 않은 일일지 모르지만, 이 당시만 해도 한글은 초등학교 들어가기 전에 떼는 거였다. 솔직히 내가 영어, 일어에 프랑스어 그리고 중국어까지 할 줄 안다는 사실을 아직 오픈하기에는 좀 이른 감이 있었다. * * * 민국이는 서점에 들어서자마자 지쳐서 유모차에서 그대로 잠들었다. 나는 민국이를 내려다보며 한숨을 팍 내쉬었다. [짜식. 공부 머리는 없는 거 같네. 너 대체 커서 뭐 먹고 살래? 없는 집 애가 머리라도 좋아야지. 쯧쯧.] 나는 뒷짐을 진 채 어슬렁어슬렁 경제 코너로 걸어갔다. 내가 공부한 대학의 도서관에 비하면 어림없는 장서 양이었지만, 이런 것에도 만족할 줄 알아야 하는 게 서민의 삶이라는 게 5년 동안 내가 배우고 습득한 거였다. 나는 괜히 옆구리에 재미없어 보이는 동화책은 눈속임용으로 낀 채였다. 어슬렁. 어슬렁. 95년의 경제서들은 서울대를 나오고 미국에서 MBA를 딴 내가 보기엔 코웃음만 나는 수준이었다. [2년 후에 IMF 온다고 예측하는 책들은 하나도 없네. 쯧쯧.] 나는 책 몇 권을 훑어보다 서민들 선동하는 단어들이나 나열한 책들을 보곤 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. 이때, 뒤로 익숙한 발걸음 소리가 들렸다. 바로 김 매니저 김미영의 발걸음 소리였다. 설마, 내가 책 읽은 것을 알았을까. 순간 등 뒤로 땀이 주르륵 흘렀다. 어쩌면 커밍아웃할 시점인지도 몰랐다. 다섯 살 아이가 한글을 안다는 게 뭐 그리 놀라운 일은 아닐지도 몰랐다. “성국아, 책 읽어?” “녜에!” 나는 태연하게 대답했다. 그러곤 눈여겨본 경제학 서적 몇 권을 김미영에게 내밀었다. 고르고 보니 김미영이 의심할 만한 책이기도 했다. “성국아, 이거 네가 읽을 거야?” “사두세요.” “<맨큐의 경제학>이랑 <자본론>을?” 나는 해맑게 고개를 끄덕였다. [나 이거 옛날에 다 읽은 거야. 그래도 요즘 나오는 헛소리하는 경제 서적보다는 고전이 낫잖아, 김 매니저.] “진짜, 읽을 거야?” 김미영은 여전히 못 믿는 눈치였다. 나는 일부러 어눌한 발음으로 두 책의 제목을 말하기로 결심했다. [어쩔 수 없이 커밍아웃해야겠네.] “맨큐의 경데학. 자봉론. 사두세요.” “성국아….” 김미영은 매우 놀란 얼굴이었다. [내가 그럼 대본 그렇게 쉽게 이해하는 게, 뭐 다 김 매니저가 설명 잘해서인 줄 알아? 나 태어날 때부터 5개 국어 한 남자야. 왜 이래.] 김미영은 잠시 멍한 얼굴로 나를 보더니, 근처에 있던 책 하나를 집어서 내 눈앞에 내밀었다. 딱 봐도 아무거나 집은 게 티가 났다. “성국아, 이거 읽어봐.” 나는 애써 천천히 한 자 한 자 읽어 내려갔다. “우. 리. 집. 을. 지. 키. 는. 경. 제.” “성국아, 너 한글 읽을 줄 알아?” [한글뿐 아니라니까. 영어, 일어, 중국어, 프랑스어. 아참, 독일어도 있지. 거기다 한국어까지 하니 6개 국어네. 나 그런 남자야.] “알았어, 성국아. 이 책 다 사줄게. 또 보고 싶은 책 없어?” [에라, 모르겠다.] 나는 <국부론>까지 집어 들었다. [고전은 영원한 거잖아? 김 매니저.] * * * 엘리베이터가 12층에 도착했다. 막 땀에 젖은 티셔츠 차림으로 나온 아빠가 얼른 나와 민국이의 손을 잡았다. “매니저님, 감사해요. 저녁 같이 먹어요.” “저, 드릴 말씀이 있어요.” “뭔데요?” 김미영은 슬쩍 내 눈치를 살폈다. “이따가요.” “네.” 아빠는 얼른 대답을 하고는 내 눈을 손으로 가리는 시늉을 했다. “성국아, 눈 꼭 감아야 해.” [하아. 이런 거에도 장단을 맞춰 줘야겠지? 민국아, 눈 감아.] 나는 민국이 눈도 손으로 가렸다. 아빠는 곧 현관문을 열어젖혔다. “성국아, 민국아. 새집 소개할게.” “자, 여기가 우리가 새로 살 집이야!” [이미 봤지만, 손뼉 좀 쳐주고 어깨춤도 쳐줄게.] 나는 얼른 현관에서 신발을 벗어 던지고, 매우 신이 난 얼굴로 어깨춤을 추기 시작했다. “우와- 우와-.” 어린애들처럼 감탄사도 연발했다. “아빠. 징짜 우리 집이야?” “어, 성국아. 네 방도 가보자.” 나는 아빠의 말이 떨어지기 무섭게 내가 찍어놓은 방으로 달려갔다. 역시 예상대로 책상이 놓여 있었다. 옆으로는 싱글 침대도 놓여 있었지만, 그건 가볍게 무시했다. 난 아직 엄마 품이 좋았다. 나는 얼른 책상 의자에 앉았다. “의자가 낮네.” 아빠는 얼른 의자를 올려줬다. 나는 배시시 웃으며 의자를 좀 더 앞으로 끌었다. [이 정도면 뭐, 공부할 만은 하네.] 아빠는 책상에 일체형으로 달린 조명도 탁 켰다. “성국아, 어때? 멋지지?” [하아, 아빠. 난 이런 조명보다 루이 폴첸이나 비스타에서 나온 조명을 좀 좋아했어.] 그래도 우선 손뼉은 쳐댔다. 짝. 짝. 짝. 김미영이 뒤에서 오더니 서점에서 산 두툼한 책 세 권을 책꽂이에 끼웠다. “성국이가 오늘 고른 책들이에요.” 아빠는 처음엔 아무 생각 없이 책들을 보다가 놀라 김미영을 쳐다봤다. “김 매니저님, 이 책들을 성국이가 다 골랐다고요?” “네. 사실 아까 드릴 말씀 있다는 게 그거였어요. 성국이가 이미 한글을 알더라고요.” [사람이라면 기본적으로 영어랑 제3 외국어 해서 3개 국어 정도는 하는 게 기본 아니겠어?] 나는 턱을 한껏 치켜세웠다. “설마, 진짜 이게 다 성국이가 읽고 싶다고 한 책이에요?” “저도 안 믿기는데요. 성국이가 다 읽겠다고 집었어요.” “뭘 모르고 집은 거겠죠.” [아빠. 애들은 뭘 모르고 집어도 맨큐의 경제학을 집진 않아. 그림책을 집지.] 엄마가 들어와서는 두 사람을 보더니 내 앞에 놓인 책들을 훑어봤다. “성국이가 고른 거죠?” 엄마는 너무 태연하게 김미영에게 물었다. 오히려 놀란 건 김미영이었다. “그걸 어떻게….” “성국이가 맨날 뉴스 보잖아요. 저도 어렴풋이 성국이가 경제 쪽에 관심 많다는 건 알았거든요. 뉴스 보면서 혼자 중얼거리는 거 들어보면 한글도 대충 알더라고요. 앵커가 하는 말이 아니라 밑에 자막 보고 읽곤 했거든요.” [어라, 엄마?] 나는 엄마를 다시 봤다. 요즘 매니지먼트 일 때문에 바빠서 얼굴 볼 시간도 없었는데, 역시 엄마는 달랐다. “소영아, 그럼 넌 성국이가 한글 아는 거 알았어?” “대강. 촬영 콘티 같은 거나 대본보고 혼자 알아서 할 때가 많았거든. 처음엔 나도 그냥 우리가 이야기한 거 듣고 하는 줄 알았는데, 어느 날 보니까 한글을 아는 것 같더라고. 대기실에 여러 대기자들 이름 적혀 있는데, 자기 이름 적힌 대기실에 곧바로 들어가곤 했거든.” “그걸 왜 말 안 했어?” “성국이도 특별 대우 받는 거 원하는 거 같지 않고 해서. 그리고 사실… 우리한테서 이렇게 특별한 아이가 태어날 거라고 나도 예상치 못했어, 자기야.” [이제 드디어 나의 가치를 알아본 거야?] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 아빠가 내 어깨를 꽉 잡았다. “이 녀석, 지 얘기하는 줄 알고 좋단다. 성국아, 짜장면 먹고 아빠랑 심도 깊은 이야기 좀 하자.” [짜장면은 좋은데, 심도 깊은 얘기. 그건 사양할게, 아빠.] 나는 손을 저었다. “네가 아무리 똑똑해도 아빠 아들인 거 잊으면 안 돼!” 아빠는 애 얼굴에 자신의 얼굴을 비벼대며 배를 뒤집어서 공기 방구를 놨다. [하아, 평범한 삶이란. 전재형 부회장이 나의 이 특별함을 알았다면 벌써 세계적인 석학과 나의 미래에 대해서 논의했을 것인데.] 지금의 아빠처럼 나를 안고 볼을 비비거나, 괜히 배에 공기 방구를 놓진 않았을 것이다. 나는 아빠에게 들려서 까르르 웃어재꼈다. * * * 졸린 민국이가 스멀스멀 엄마 곁으로 밀고 들어왔다. 나는 엄마 곁에 딱 붙어서 민국이를 한 발로 쭉 밀었다. [전민국. 너도 이제 세 살이니까 독립해야지.] 그런데 이상하게 민국이는 내 허리를 잡더니 이마를 콕 박았다. “혀엉.” [너 설마 나랑 같이 자려고 그런 거야?] “헤.” 민국이는 졸린 얼굴로 나를 보며 배시시 웃었다. [못생긴 게.] “혀엉. 코 자. 가티.” [뭐지? 나랑 자자고?] “혀엉. 조아. 헤.” 이 녀석 한마디에 왜 가슴이 몽글몽글하지? 엄마가 나와 민국이를 보더니 흐뭇하게 미소를 지었다. “성국아, 민국이가 형아 정말 좋아하는 것 같아.” [좀 모자란 경쟁자 녀석일 뿐이야, 엄마.] “성국아, 만약 엄마가 어디가 아파도 민국이라 잘 지내야 해?” 뭐지? 엄마가 어디 아픈가. 그 순간, 가슴이 쿵쾅거리더니 심장이 벌렁대기 시작했다. “엄. 마. 아프지 마. 흐어엉! 흐어엉!” 막 샤워를 마친 아빠가 놀라 뛰어 들어왔다. “성국아, 왜 울어?” “자기야, 내가 그냥 성국이한테 혹시 내가 아프면 민국이랑 잘 지내야 한다고 했더니 막 우네.” “소영아, 애한테 그런 장난을 치면 어떡해.” “흑. 흑. 흑.” 나는 훌쩍이며 엄마 손을 꼭 잡았다. [지금 나한테 장난친 거야? 근데 나, 순진하게 속은 거야? 이 철없는 엄마, 아빠야!] “으아앙!” 울음이 터져 나왔다. 왜 그런지 모르겠지만, 이 철없는 엄마, 아빠가 내 곁에 없다는 생각만 해도 가슴이 미어지는 것 같았다. 저번 생에서는 느껴보지 못한 감정이었다. “성국아, 엄마가 미안해. 엄마 건강해. 걱정하지 마.” [다시는 그런 말 하지도 마, 엄마. 엄마가 아파도 내가 돈 벌어서 다 고쳐줄 거니까, 걱정도 말고!] 나는 눈물을 겨우 훔쳤다. “소영아, 너도 참.” “그냥… 나도 엄마, 아빠가 되니까 우리 버린 엄마, 아빠가 조금 이해도 돼. 자신들이 못 키우니까, 우리가 그래도 조금이나마 나은 환경에서 자라길 바란 거였을 거잖아.” 나는 엄마의 뱃살에 폭 안겼다. “참, 내일 성국이 촬영 아니야?” “그러고 보니 내일이 삼전 전자 마지막 카탈로그 촬영이네.” “어디서 한다고 했지?” “삼풍백화점에 삼전 전자 코너에서 찍는다고 했어.” [잠깐만, 엄마 지금 삼풍백화점이라고 했어?]","completion":"Episode 25 Located in Jamsil, a 34-pyeong apartment. The 12th floor, commonly referred to as the \\"royal floor,\\" among the total 23 floors. A small moving truck stopped at the entrance of the apartment. Although there were houses moving in using gondolas here and there, our house didn't need one. Except for the clothes we wore, the dishes, and the books I read, there was nothing to bring. Kim Mi-young, who followed, also got out of the car. I was holding Min-guk's hand tightly. Having turned three years old, Min-guk, who had gained strength in his legs, was running around in all directions, making him a bit uncontrollable. Such a day, we shouldn't trouble mom and dad. [Stay still.] “Hyeeong!” [Stay still, I told you, brother.] “Eung.” Min-guk slightly pouted his lips and nodded his head. Fortunately, unlike Tae-guk, In-seong was well-behaved. He listened to me, his brother, well. This guy seemed like someone I could train. Kim Mi-young approached and gently grabbed my hand. “I'll look after Seong-guk and Min-guk.” Mom, with a sorry face, pulled out a few ten-thousand-won bills from her wallet. “Sister, Seong-guk has been really interested in picture books and fairy tales lately. Please go to a nearby bookstore and buy some books, and have a nice lunch. I'm really sorry for always being indebted like this.” “We're partners, aren't we?” “It feels like I'm always the one receiving more help as a partner.” “I owe it to Seong-guk for getting a new job. And I'm Seong-guk's manager. This is my job. Anyway, I'll take care of Seong-guk and Min-guk while you move.” Kim Mi-young reluctantly accepted the money mom offered. Then she looked at me. “Seong-guk, shall we go see some picture books?” “Joayo (I like it)!” I answered cheerfully. These days, it might not be a big deal for a five-year-old child to read Hangul, but at that time, Hangul was something you learned before entering elementary school. Honestly, it was a bit early to reveal that I could speak English, Japanese, French, and Chinese. * * * As soon as Min-guk entered the bookstore, he fell asleep in the stroller, exhausted. I looked down at Min-guk and sighed deeply. [This kid. Seems like he doesn't have a head for studying. What are you going to do for a living when you grow up? A child from a poor family should at least be smart. Tsk tsk.] I leisurely walked towards the economics section with my hands behind my back. Compared to the library of the university I attended, the number of books was laughable, but learning to be satisfied with such things was what I had learned and acquired during my five years of living as a commoner. I was carrying a boring-looking fairy tale book on my side as a decoy. Leisurely. Leisurely. The economic books from '95 seemed laughable to me, who had graduated from Seoul National University and earned an MBA in the United States. [Not a single book predicts the IMF crisis coming in two years. Tsk tsk.] I skimmed through a few books and shook my head at those that merely listed words to incite the common people. Then, I heard a familiar sound of footsteps from behind. It was Kim Mi-young, the manager's footsteps. Could she have found out that I was reading books? Sweat ran down my back for a moment. Maybe it was time to come out. Knowing Hangul as a five-year-old might not be so surprising after all. “Seong-guk, can you read?” “Nye (Yes)!” I answered calmly. Then I handed Kim Mi-young a few economics books I had been eyeing. It turned out to be books that might make Kim Mi-young suspicious. “Seong-guk, are you going to read these?” “Buy them.” “<Principles of Economics> and <Capital>?” I nodded brightly. [I've read these a long time ago. But still, classics are better than the nonsense in economic books these days, Manager Kim.] “Really, you're going to read them?” Kim Mi-young still seemed incredulous. I decided to pronounce the titles of the two books awkwardly on purpose. [I guess I have to come out.] “Principles of Econo-nomics. Capit-al. Buy them.” “Seong-guk…” Kim Mi-young looked very surprised. [Did you think I understood the script so easily because Manager Kim explained it well? I'm a man who was born speaking five languages. Why are you like this?] Kim Mi-young, with a dazed face, picked up a book nearby and held it in front of me. It was obvious she picked up just anything. “Seong-guk, read this.” I deliberately read it slowly, letter by letter. “Our. Home. Economy.” “Seong-guk, you know how to read Hangul?” [Not just Hangul. English, Japanese, Chinese, French. Oh, and German too. That makes six languages. I'm that kind of man.] “Alright, Seong-guk. I'll buy all these books for you. Do you want any other books?” [Oh well, I give up.] I also picked up <The Wealth of Nations>. [Classics are eternal, right, Manager Kim?] * * * The elevator arrived on the 12th floor. Dad, who just came out in a sweat-soaked T-shirt, quickly came out and grabbed Min-guk's hand. “Manager, thank you. Let's have dinner together.” “I have something to tell you.” “What is it?” Kim Mi-young glanced at me cautiously. “Later.” “Okay.” Dad quickly responded and then made a gesture to cover my eyes with his hands. “Seong-guk, you have to close your eyes tightly.” [Ha. I guess I have to play along with this, huh? Min-guk, close your eyes.] I covered Min-guk's eyes with my hands as well. Dad soon opened the front door. “Seong-guk, Min-guk. Let me introduce you to our new home.” “Here, this is our new home!” [I've seen it already, but I'll clap and dance for you.] I quickly threw off my shoes at the entrance and started dancing with a very excited face. “Wow- Wow-.” I also burst out with exclamations like a little kid. “Dad. Is this really our house?” “Yes, Seong-guk. Let's go see your room too.” As soon as Dad's words fell, I ran to the room I had marked. As expected, there was a desk. A single bed was also placed next to it, but I lightly ignored it. I still liked mom's embrace. I quickly sat down in the desk chair. “The chair is low.” Dad immediately raised the chair for me. I grinned and pulled the chair a bit closer. [Well, this is good enough for studying.] Dad also turned on the integrated desk lamp. “Seong-guk, how is it? Cool, right?” [Ha, Dad. I preferred lights from Louis Poulsen or Vistosi.] Still, I clapped my hands. Clap. Clap. Clap. Kim Mi-young came from behind and inserted the three thick books we bought at the bookstore into the bookshelf. “These are the books Seong-guk chose today.” Dad initially looked at the books without much thought but then looked surprised at Kim Mi-young. “Manager Kim, did Seong-guk choose all these books?” “Yes. Actually, that's what I wanted to tell you earlier. Seong-guk already knows Hangul.” [Isn't it basic for people to know three languages, including English and a third foreign language?] I puffed out my chest. “Really, did he choose all these books because he wants to read them?” “I couldn't believe it either. Seong-guk picked them all up saying he would read them.” “He must have picked them without knowing.” [Dad. Kids don't pick up <Principles of Economics> without knowing. They pick up picture books.] Mom came in and looked at the two, then glanced at the books in front of me. “Seong-guk chose these, right?” Mom asked Kim Mi-young too calmly. Kim Mi-young was the one who was surprised this time. “How did you…” “Seong-guk always watches the news. I vaguely knew Seong-guk was interested in economics. He would mutter to himself while watching the news, not what the anchor said but reading the subtitles.” [Oh, Mom?] I looked at Mom again. Lately, I've been too busy with management work to see her face, but Mom was different. “So-young, did you know Seong-guk knew Hangul?” “Roughly. He would often do things like shooting contis or scripts by himself. At first, I thought he was just doing what we talked about, but one day, it seemed like he knew Hangul. He would go straight into the waiting room with his name on it among the many waiting rooms.” “Why didn't you say anything?” “It didn't seem like Seong-guk wanted special treatment. And honestly… I didn't expect such a special child to be born to us, honey.” [Have you finally recognized my value?] I shrugged my shoulders. Dad grabbed my shoulder tightly. “This kid, thinking we're talking about him and feeling good. Seong-guk, let's have jajangmyeon and talk deeply with Dad.” [Jajangmyeon is good, but deep talks. I'll pass, Dad.] I waved my hand. “No matter how smart you are, don't forget you're Dad's son!” Dad rubbed his face against the child's face and flipped him over to let out an air fart. [Ha, the ordinary life. If Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung knew my specialness, he would have already discussed my future with world-renowned scholars.] He wouldn't have held me and rubbed his cheek against mine or let out an air fart for no reason. I laughed out loud, carried by Dad. * * * Sleepy Min-guk slowly snuggled next to Mom. I stuck close to Mom and pushed Min-guk away with one foot. [Jeon Min-guk. You're three years old now, so you should be independent.] But strangely, Min-guk grabbed my waist and bumped his forehead against me. “Hyeeong.” [Are you trying to sleep with me?] “He.” Min-guk looked at me with a sleepy face and grinned. [Ugly thing.] “Hyeeong. Sleep. Together.” [What? Sleep with me?] “He. Joa. He.” Why does my heart feel warm at this little guy's single word? Mom looked at me and Min-guk and smiled contentedly. “Seong-guk, it seems Min-guk really likes his brother.” [Just a slightly lacking competitor, Mom.] “Seong-guk, if Mom gets sick, you have to get along well with Min-guk, okay?” What? Is Mom sick? At that moment, my heart pounded, and my heart started to race. “Mom. Don't get sick. Hyeong! Hyeong!” Dad, who had just finished showering, rushed in, surprised. “Seong-guk, why are you crying?” “Honey, I just told Seong-guk to get along well with Min-guk in case I get sick, and he suddenly started crying.” “So-young, how can you joke about that with a child.” “Huk. Huk. Huk.” I sobbed and held Mom's hand tightly. [Did you just play a joke on me? But I, naively, fell for it? This irresponsible Mom and Dad!] “Uwaaang!” Tears burst out. For some reason, just the thought of not having this irresponsible Mom and Dad by my side made my heart feel like it was being squeezed. It was an emotion I had never felt in my previous life. “Seong-guk, Mom is sorry. Mom is healthy. Don't worry.” [Don't ever say that again, Mom. Even if Mom gets sick, I'll earn money and cure everything, so don't worry!] I barely wiped away my tears. “So-young, really.” “Just... now that I've become a mom and dad, I can somewhat understand our parents who abandoned us. They couldn't raise us, so they hoped we would grow up in a slightly better environment.” I buried myself in Mom's belly. “By the way, doesn't Seong-guk have a shoot tomorrow?” “Now that you mention it, tomorrow is the last catalog shoot for Samsung Electronics.” “Where did they say it was?” “They said it's at the Samsung Electronics corner in Sampoong Department Store.” [Wait, Mom, did you just say Sampoong Department Store?]"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[아빠, 입 냄새 나.] 그러나 난 눈을 뜨지 않았다. 곧이어 아빠가 씻는 소리가 들렸고, 엄마도 일어나서 나와 민국이에게 입을 맞추고는 부엌으로 향했다. 엄마가 아빠에게 이런저런 이야기 하는 소리가 들렸다. “소영아, 오늘 성국이 일은 언제쯤 끝나?” “낮에 카탈로그 촬영하고, 팬 사인회도 한대. 그거 끝나고 삼풍백화점에 맛있는 집 있다고 선미 씨가 예약했다고 거기 가서 저녁 먹고 끝날 거 같아.” [맙소사!] 이건 뭐 빼도 박도 못 하는 죽음의 스케줄 표였다. “성국이도 이제 진짜 모델 일은 끝이네. 성국이 유치원은 알아봤어?” “중간에 옮기는 거라 어렵긴 한데, 지금 대기 한 군데 걸어뒀어. 미영 언니 친구가 이 동네 살아서 좋은 유치원 추천해줬어.” “김 매니저님은 진짜 은인이야.” “자기야, 이제는 김 대표님이라고 불러야지. 나는 김 대표님 회사의 직원이고.” 엄마의 웃음소리가 들렸다. SKJ 기획은 나와 임선미를 주축으로 돌아가는 어엿한 사무실이 됐다. 김미영도 원룸 건물을 정리하고 이쪽으로 집을 옮기기로 결정한 상태였다. 더불어 SKJ 기획 사무실도 접근성이 좋은 강남으로 옮길 예정이었다. “쉬는 날에 나도 돌아다니면서 이 동네 상권 빨리 알아봐야겠어. 아파트도 많고 해서, 배달 위주로 하는 보쌈집이면 가게가 크지 않아도 될 것 같아.” 아빠는 나름 장사에서만은 선구안을 가진 것 같았다. [그래, 앞으로는 배달이 대세지. 나도 저번 생에서 구치소에서 나오자마자 치킨 배달시켜 먹었다고. 하아. 내가 이러고 있을 때가 아닌데…. 내가 지난 5년 동안 얼마나 뼈 빠지게 살아왔는데, 오늘 죽는 건가….] 내가 뒤척이자, 잠에서 깬 민국이가 내 얼굴을 슬쩍 손으로 쓰다듬었다. “형아. 아띰. 형아, 아띰.” 내가 눈을 뜨자 민국이는 기뻐서 내 얼굴에 뽀뽀를 해대며 침을 발라댔다. [이러지 마. 정든다고.] 나는 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. [죽느냐 사느냐, 그것이 문제로다!] * * * 김미영이 운전하는 차도 최근에 새로 뽑은 95년식 국산 지프차였다. 승차감이 훌륭하진 않았지만, 이전에 타고 다니던 경차에 비해서는 공간도 여유로웠고 안정적이었다. 나는 카시트에 앉아서 눈살을 찌푸렸다. 김미영이 백미러로 나를 살폈다. “성국이 엄마, 성국이 오늘 컨디션이 영 별로인 것 같은데요.” “저도 걱정이에요. 아침에 잠깐 샤워하고 나와 보니까 애가 영 이상해서요. 병원 가야 하는 거 아닌가 잠시 고민했어요.” “걱정이네요. 카탈로그 촬영 끝나고 5시부터 팬 사인회도 있는데.” 나는 차에 달린 시계를 봤다. 오후 2시. 내 기억으로는 삼풍백화점은 저녁 시간에 가까워져서 무너진다. 저녁 준비를 위해 장을 보러 온 주부들이 많이 희생됐단 뉴스가 아직도 머릿속에 또렷하다. 덜컹. 차가 거친 노면 위를 지나갔다. 때마침 속이 울렁거리기 시작했다. 그리고 저 멀리 삼풍백화점이 보이기 시작했다. 김미영이 운전하는 차가 삼풍백화점의 주차장으로 들어섰다. 덜컹. 주차장 방지턱을 넘어가던 김미영의 차가 다시 한 번 덜컹거렸다. 그래, 이때다! “우우욱-.” “성국아, 왜 그래?” 나는 그대로 먹은 것을 다 토해냈다. “우우욱- 우우욱- 우우욱-.” 새 차를 산 김미영에게는 미안한 일이었지만, 3시간 후에는 나에게 고마워할 게 분명하다. 엄마는 얼른 휴지로 내가 토한 것을 닦으며 문을 열었다. “언니, 화장실에 데리고 가서 먹은 거 토해야겠어요.” “아무래도 병원 가야 할 것 같으니까, 토하고 어서 나와요. 여기서 차 대기시켜 놓고 있을게요.” “네, 언니.” 엄마는 나를 안고 뛰기 시작했다. 두근. 두근. 두근. 엄마의 긴박한 심장 소리가 들려왔다. “성국아, 어디가 아픈 거야.” [엄마, 나 괜찮아. 괜찮아질 거야. 근데… 화장실 말고 병원을 가야 하는데….] 한숨도 못 자서 잠은 쏟아졌고, 속은 뒤집어졌다. 거기다 힘을 꽉 주고 있는 항문도 곧 활짝 열릴 것 같은 기분이 들었다. [기저귀는 이미 뗐는데….] 엄마가 얼른 나를 안고 삼풍백화점 안으로 들어가려는데, 전재형 부회장이 양 비서를 비롯한 임원들과 걸어오는 게 보였다. [전재형 부회장까지 있잖아. 오늘 잘못하면 다 저세상에서 만나겠네…. 그건 좀 곤란한데….] 전재형 부회장은 엄마와 나를 단번에 알아봤다. “양 비서, 성국이 아닌가?” “그러게요. 어디가 아픈 거 같은데요.” “한번 살펴보고 오게.” “네, 부회장님.” 양 비서는 얼른 엄마에게 달려왔다. “성국이 어머님, 괜찮으세요?” “성국이가 이상해요, 양 비서님.” “우우욱-.” 나는 잘 닦인 백화점 복도에 토를 조금 했다. 그리고 꾹 참았던 항문도 개방해 버렸다. 뿌직- 뿌직- 뿌직-. “어머머, 성국아.” 엄마는 사색이 된 채 나를 안고 흔들었다. 대충 음식을 게워냈고, 장도 비웠다. 한숨도 잠을 못 잔 덕분에 내 눈은 스르르 감겼다. 귓가에 소리가 들렸다. 어느새 다가온 전재형 부회장의 목소리였다. “오늘 카탈로그 촬영이랑 팬 사인회 취소해요.” “부회장님, 성국이만 빼고 진행하시죠.” 임원진 중 한 명의 목소리였다. “어차피 ‘저스트’는 일정이 바뀌어서 카탈로그 촬영만 예정된 상태라서요. 임선미 씨와 성국이 촬영과 팬 사인회인데, 취소하는 게 좋을 것 같습니다.” 양 비서가 의견을 내자 아무도 토를 달지 못했다. “어머니, 우선 성국이 대충 씻겨 나오세요. 삼전 병원으로 저랑 가시죠. 바로 진료 볼 수 있을 겁니다.” “네, 감사합니다.” 엄마는 얼른 나를 화장실로 데리고 들어가 등을 두드렸다. 나는 겨우 의식을 부여잡고 마지막까지 속과 장을 비웠다. 아랫도리가 시원해졌다. 양 비서 아저씨가 급히 준비한 타월을 몸에 두르자 나는 그대로 정신 줄을 놓고 말았다. * * * [이건 김미영 차의 승차감이 아닌데….] 간간이 들리는 목소리. 바로 전재형 부회장과 양 비서의 목소리였다. “부회장님, 소아과에 전화했습니다. 바로 진료 가능합니다.” “감사합니다. 정말 감사합니다.” 걱정하는 엄마의 목소리가 들렸다. “근데 오늘 저희 때문에 스케줄이 꼬여서 어떡하죠.” “걱정 마세요. 저도 아이 키우는 입장에서 아이 아픈 것만큼 걱정스러운 일도 없더라고요. 우선 성국이부터 돌보고 다음 스케줄을 잡아보죠. 아이가 이렇게 아픈데, 일시키는 건 아니죠.” 전재형 부회장의 말이었다. [아버지가 우리가 아픈 거에 관심이 있었던가.] 그런 생각을 하는 사이에 전재형 부회장의 차가 멈춰 섰다. 미리 연락을 받고 대기하던 경호 요원들이 나와 엄마를 급히 소아과로 안내했다. * * * 전재형 부회장은 잠시 차에서 대기했다. 조수석에 앉은 양 비서가 뒤를 돌아봤다. “부회장님, 저희는 다시 삼풍백화점으로 갈까요?” “‘저스트’는 카탈로그 촬영만 하는 거지?” “네, 임선미 씨도 자택으로 다시 돌아갔다고 연락이 왔습니다.” “그럼, 성국이 상황만 지켜보고 가는 게 좋을 것 같네. 우리 모델이 갑자기 아픈 것도 영 마음에 걸리고, 혹 아이가 지금보다 상태가 더 나빠지면 삼전 전자 이미지랑도 직결될 거 아닌가.” “저도 그게 걱정입니다. 우선 삼전 병원 의사들이야 국내 최고들이니 믿어보시고, 차에서 대기하시겠습니까?” 그러기엔 냄새가 심하게 났다. “나가서 맑은 공기 좀 쐬지.” “네, 부회장님.” 전재형 부회장은 차에서 내려 삼전 병원의 정원으로 향했다. 경호원들이 조용히 따라붙었다. 저녁이 가까워지자 조금 시원한 바람이 불었다. “오랜만에 병원 정원 산책하는 것 같네.” “전주신 회장님이 쓰러지셨을 때 오시고 처음이시죠?” “응.” 전재형 부회장은 고개를 끄덕였다. 작년 초 전주신 회장이 잠시 쓰러져서 난리가 난 적이 있었다. 주가도 떨어지고, 후계 구도 문제도 또다시 불거졌다. 그 이후로 전주신 회장은 자신이 갑자기 죽더라도 문제가 없도록 상속 문제를 은밀하게 해결하고 있단 이야기만 전해 들었다. 삼전 전자의 이미지 변신으로 역대 최고 매출을 기록하게 만든 게 전재형 부회장이었지만, 만약 성국이가 잘못되기라도 해서 이미지에 타격을 입는다면 삼전 그룹 왕좌의 자리는 누가 차지할지 몰랐다. 전주신 회장의 속내를 아는 사람은 아무도 없었다.","completion":"Episode 26 Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung turned his stiff neck. \\"Is it already this time...\\" The clock was pointing to 10 PM. Knock. Knock. Just then, a knock was heard, and Secretary Yang entered. \\"Vice Chairman, it's time to leave the office.\\" \\"Right, is it the last shooting for Samjeon Electronics tomorrow?\\" \\"You remember that too?\\" \\"How could I forget? Thanks to that kid Seong-guk, Samjeon Electronics successfully changed its image. It became more approachable, and for the first time, its sales surpassed those of Lucky products.\\" \\"That's right. We really got back at Lucky for taking the baseball championship from us last year.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung shook his head. \\"Well, we didn't even make it to the playoffs, so it's not like they took the championship from us.\\" Still, his expression was one of regret. There was no one who loved baseball as much as Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, but Samjeon Group had always fallen short of expectations. \\"Maybe I should go to the shooting tomorrow... Where is it?\\" \\"It's scheduled to be at Sampung Department Store. And after that, there's a fan signing event.\\" \\"Seong-guk, 'Just', and Sun-mi are appearing?\\" \\"Yes, all the exclusive models for Samjeon Electronics will be there. It's Seong-guk's last shooting.\\" \\"Time flies.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung smiled bitterly. Time was flying, but Chairman Jeon Ju-sin was still going strong, and his brother was always waiting for Jeon Jae-hyung's mistakes. Secretary Yang glanced at Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. \\"Vice Chairman, it seems like Chairman Jeon is very pleased with Samjeon Electronics' major image overhaul.\\" \\"I want to focus on semiconductors now, but my father is too conservative...\\" \\"Don't worry. Chairman Jeon will surely support your next move, recognizing this success of Samjeon Electronics as your excellent decision.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung nodded. Secretary Yang had served Chairman Jeon Ju-sin and was still reporting everything about Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung through him. Perhaps no one knew Chairman Jeon Ju-sin better than Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. \\"Keep my visit tomorrow a secret.\\" \\"I will do so.\\" This meant it was a secret to everyone except a few major media outlets, as Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's surprise visit was meant for natural photos and promotional purposes. * * * Spending the night wide awake. This was the first time in my five-year-old life that I truly felt this saying. I really couldn't sleep at all. My eyes were closed, but I wasn't asleep. There were moments when sleepiness washed over me, but each time, I felt chills down my spine. Sampung Department Store! And today was precisely June 29, 1995. How do I remember all this? Many executives from Samjeon Group lived in apartments near Sampung Department Store. Some were unharmed, but many lost their families. For a while, the atmosphere at Samjeon Group was not good. Rustle. Rustle. I heard Dad getting up. Dad was still working at <Mr. Won's Bossam> in Suyuri. He was checking out the local market and looking for a shop after moving, so he was commuting to the distant <Mr. Won's Bossam>. Dad sleepily kissed me and Min-guk. [Dad, your breath stinks.] But I didn't open my eyes. Soon, I heard Dad washing up, and Mom also got up, kissed me and Min-guk, and headed to the kitchen. I heard Mom talking to Dad. \\"So-young, when does Seong-guk's work end today?\\" \\"He has a catalog shoot during the day, and there's also a fan signing event. After that, Sun-mi said she reserved a place at Sampung Department Store for dinner.\\" [Oh my God!] This was a death schedule, no doubt about it. \\"Seong-guk's really done with modeling work now. Have you looked into kindergartens for him?\\" \\"It's tough because we're moving in the middle of the year, but I've put us on the waiting list at one place. Mi-young's friend lives in this neighborhood and recommended a good kindergarten.\\" \\"Manager Kim is really a savior.\\" \\"Honey, you should call him President Kim now. I'm an employee of President Kim's company.\\" I heard Mom's laughter. SKJ Planning had become a proper office revolving around me and Lim Sun-mi. Kim Mi-young had also decided to move here after settling her one-room building. SKJ Planning's office was also planning to move to a more accessible location in Gangnam. \\"I should take a day off and quickly learn about the local market. With all these apartments, a delivery-focused Bossam place might work even if it's not big.\\" Dad seemed to have a knack for business. [Yeah, delivery is the future. In my past life, right after getting out of prison, I ordered chicken delivery. Ah, I shouldn't be doing this... After living so hard for the past five years, am I going to die today?] As I tossed and turned, Min-guk, who had woken up, gently stroked my face. \\"Brother. Awake. Brother, awake.\\" When I opened my eyes, Min-guk happily smeared his saliva on my face with kisses. [Don't do this. I'll get attached.] I got up abruptly. [To die or not to die, that is the question!] * * * Kim Mi-young's car, a newly purchased 95 model domestic jeep, wasn't very comfortable, but it was more spacious and stable compared to the previous compact car. I sat in the car seat, frowning. Kim Mi-young glanced at me through the rearview mirror. \\"Seong-guk's mom, Seong-guk seems to be in a bad condition today.\\" \\"I'm worried too. This morning, after a quick shower, I noticed something was off with him. I even considered taking him to the hospital for a moment.\\" \\"It's concerning. There's a catalog shoot ending at 5 PM, followed by a fan signing event.\\" I looked at the car clock. 2 PM. From what I remember, Sampung Department Store collapses close to dinner time. The news still vividly remembered how many housewives who went shopping for dinner preparations were among the victims. Thud. The car jolted over a rough patch of road. Just then, my stomach started to churn. And Sampung Department Store came into view. Kim Mi-young's car entered the parking lot of Sampung Department Store. Thud. Kim Mi-young's car jolted again as it crossed a speed bump in the parking lot. Now's the time! \\"Ugh-.\\" \\"Seong-guk, what's wrong?\\" I vomited everything I had eaten. \\"Ugh- Ugh- Ugh-.\\" I felt sorry for Kim Mi-young, who had just bought a new car, but in three hours, she would surely be grateful to me. Mom quickly wiped up my vomit with tissues and opened the door. \\"Unnie, I need to take him to the bathroom to vomit.\\" \\"We should probably go to the hospital, so come out quickly after vomiting. I'll wait here with the car.\\" \\"Okay, Unnie.\\" Mom started running with me in her arms. Thump. Thump. Thump. I could hear Mom's heart racing. \\"Seong-guk, where does it hurt?\\" [Mom, I'm okay. I'll be okay. But... we need to go to the hospital, not the bathroom...] I hadn't slept at all, so I was drowsy, and my stomach was turning. On top of that, my tightly clenched anus felt like it was about to burst open. [I've already stopped wearing diapers...] As Mom tried to enter Sampung Department Store with me, Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung and his executives, including Secretary Yang, were seen walking towards us. [Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung is here too. If things go wrong today, we'll all meet in the afterlife... That would be problematic...] Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung recognized Mom and me immediately. \\"Secretary Yang, isn't that Seong-guk?\\" \\"It seems like he's sick.\\" \\"Let's check on him.\\" \\"Yes, Vice Chairman.\\" Secretary Yang quickly approached Mom. \\"Seong-guk's mother, are you okay?\\" \\"Seong-guk is acting strange, Secretary Yang.\\" \\"Ugh-.\\" I vomited a little on the well-polished department store floor. And then, I let go of my clenched anus. Pfft- Pfft- Pfft-. \\"Oh my, Seong-guk.\\" Mom turned pale and shook me in her arms. I managed to vomit out the food and empty my bowels. Thanks to not sleeping at all, my eyes slowly closed. I heard voices around me. It was Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's voice that had approached. \\"Cancel today's catalog shoot and fan signing event.\\" \\"Vice Chairman, let's proceed without Seong-guk.\\" One of the executives spoke. \\"Anyway, 'Just' was only scheduled for the catalog shoot. It was supposed to be a shoot and fan signing event with Lim Sun-mi and Seong-guk, so it's better to cancel.\\" As Secretary Yang suggested, no one objected. \\"Mother, please clean up Seong-guk and come out. Let's go to Samjeon Hospital with me. You can get a consultation right away.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Mom quickly took me to the bathroom and patted my back. I barely managed to hold on to consciousness and emptied my stomach and bowels to the end. My lower body felt relieved. Secretary Yang quickly wrapped a towel around me, and I let go of my consciousness. * * * [This isn't the ride of Kim Mi-young's car...] Intermittent voices. It was Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung and Secretary Yang's voices. \\"Vice Chairman, I called the pediatric department. They can see us right away.\\" \\"Thank you. Thank you so much.\\" Mom's worried voice was heard. \\"But what about our schedule today because of us?\\" \\"Don't worry. I have a child too, and I know there's nothing more worrying than a sick child. Let's take care of Seong-guk first and then arrange the next schedule. It's not right to make a child work in this condition.\\" It was Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's words. [Did Dad ever care when we were sick?] While I was thinking, Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's car stopped. Security personnel who had been waiting came out and quickly guided Mom to the pediatric department. * * * Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung waited in the car for a while. Secretary Yang, sitting in the passenger seat, looked back. \\"Vice Chairman, shall we go back to Sampung Department Store?\\" \\"'Just' is only doing the catalog shoot, right?\\" \\"Yes, Lim Sun-mi also returned home according to the contact.\\" \\"Then, it's better to wait and see Seong-guk's condition. I'm also concerned about our model suddenly getting sick, and if his condition worsens, it could directly affect Samjeon Electronics' image.\\" \\"I'm worried about that too. Let's trust the doctors at Samjeon Hospital for now, as they are the best in the country. Shall we wait in the car?\\" But the smell was too strong. \\"Let's go out and get some fresh air.\\" \\"Yes, Vice Chairman.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung got out of the car and headed to the garden of Samjeon Hospital. Security personnel quietly followed. As evening approached, a slightly cool breeze blew. \\"It's been a while since I've taken a walk in the hospital garden.\\" \\"It's your first time since Chairman Jeon Ju-sin collapsed, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung nodded. Early last year, there was a commotion when Chairman Jeon Ju-sin briefly collapsed. The stock price dropped, and the issue of succession resurfaced. Since then, Chairman Jeon Ju-sin had been secretly resolving inheritance issues to ensure there would be no problems even if he suddenly died. Although Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung had achieved the highest sales ever by transforming Samjeon Electronics' image, if something went wrong with Seong-guk and the image was damaged, it was uncertain who would take the throne of Samjeon Group. No one knew the true intentions of Chairman Jeon Ju-sin."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: HeyASSISTANT:","completion":"Hello! How can I help you today?"},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

[아하, 속 쓰려.] 매운 김치 때문에 여전히 속도 엉덩이도 따끔거렸다. 1인실에 마련된 TV에서는 계속해서 삼풍백화점 붕괴 현장이 나오고 있었다. 폭격이라도 맞은 듯 건물의 일부만 남기고 처참하게 붕괴된 삼풍백화점. 그곳에서 연락이 끊긴 가족들을 찾는 사람들의 절규. 나는 잠시 눈을 감았다. 이때, 화면에 나온 아나운서의 입에서 기업들과 전국 각지에서 참사 현장 복구를 위한 성금이 도착하고 있단 이야기가 흘러나왔다. 나는 얼른 몸을 일으켰다. “엄마, 나두.” “성국아, 뭐라고?” “나두 저거.” 나는 성금액이 올라가는 TV 화면을 가리켰다. “성국이 엄마, 성국이가 기부하고 싶나 봐요.” 김미영이 빨리 눈치를 챘다. 엄마와 아빠는 서로를 바라보더니 고개를 끄덕였다. 아빠는 내 곁으로 오더니 내 손을 꼭 잡았다. “성국아, 내일 아빠가 성국이 이름으로 기부할게.” “응.” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 삼풍백화점 사고가 나고 닷새가 훌쩍 지났다. 초반 생존자들이 나오고는 더는 진전이 없었다. 전재형 부회장은 조간신문 몇 개를 번갈아 봤다. 처참하게 무너진 잔해에서 기적에 가까운 생존자가 나왔고, 성국이가 삼풍백화점 참사 생존자를 위한 모금에 천만 원을 기부했단 뉴스가 흘러나왔다. 동시에 그날 성국이의 사연도 함께 나왔다. “전성국 군은 그날 오후에 예정된 삼전 전자 카탈로그 촬영 및 팬 사인회 때문에 삼풍백화점으로 향하는 길에 심한 배탈이 나서 병원으로 향해 목숨을 구할 수 있었습니다.” 최고의 인기 그룹 ‘저스트’가 스케줄 문제로 팬 사인회는 참석 안 하고 카탈로그만 찍고 간 사연부터 일반인들이 아슬아슬하게 사고를 피한 사연이 줄줄이 이어졌다. 삼풍백화점 관리 직원들이 사고를 미리 알고 피한 사실이 드러난 부분에 대해서는 국민적인 공분이 일었다. 이제 적절하게 전재형 부회장과 성국이의 이야기를 터트릴 때가 된 타이밍이었다. 전재형 부회장은 곧바로 양 비서를 호출했다. 곧 양 비서가 노크를 하고 들어왔다. “부회장님, 부르셨습니까?” “며칠 후 성국이와의 일화를 언론에 풀면 좋을 것 같아서.” “안 그래도 그 말씀 드리려고 했습니다. 그리고 성국이네에서 부탁을 하나 해왔습니다.” “부탁? 무슨 부탁?” * * * 제2의 유리 젤라라니! 나는 한숨을 팍 내쉬었다. 실종자들을 찾아내지 못하자 무당과 각종 심령술사. 심지어 초능력자로 유명한 유리 젤라의 섭외에 실패하자 어떤 낯선 나라에서 금발의 남자아이가 와서 말도 안 되는 상황이 연출됐다. “여기 기운이 느껴져요.” [그건 나도 하겠다, 이것아!] 시간은 흐르고 사람들의 마음은 초조했다. 그걸 이해하지 못하는 것은 아니었다. 뉴스에서는 연일 실종자를 찾지 못하자 이제 실종자 찾기를 마무리해야 하는 게 아니냐는 의견도 나왔다. “이거 예산 낭비라고요!” 예나 지금이나 정치인들이 들고 나오는 레퍼토리는 뻔했다. [쯧쯧쯧.] 나는 두고만 보고 있을 수가 없었다. 그래서 고심 끝에 김미영에게 부탁할 계획을 세웠다. 현재로서는 가장 끗발 있는 상대는 김미영이었다. 김미영이 집에 와서 저녁을 먹는 날, 그날도 마찬가지로 뉴스에서는 삼풍백화점 붕괴 사건에 대해서 보고하고 있었다. “이제 정말 실종자도 안 나오나 봐요.” “찾는 사람들도 지치고, 구호의 손길도 줄어드나 봐요. 일각에서는 어서 사건을 마무리하고 싶어 하기도 하고요.” 이때, 나는 얼른 김미영의 손을 꽉 잡았다. “앙 돼요.” “성국아, 뭐라고?” “앙 돼요. 절대 앙 돼요.” “뭔 소리야?” “사람 있떠. 으아아앙.” 나는 눈물을 터트렸다. 순간 엄마와 김미영이 나를 쳐다봤다. 김미영인 당혹스러운 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 그게 무슨 말이야?” “부탕. 부탕. 삼전에 부탕. 일. 이. 삼. 사. 오만 뎌!” “5일만 더?” “녜에!” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. 김미영은 고심 끝에 삼전 그룹의 양 비서에 전화를 걸었다. * * * “성국이가 수색을 딱 5일만 더 해달라고 부탁했다고요?” “네, 회장님.” “아이가요?” “혹시….” 양 비서는 말을 아꼈다. “양 비서, 삼청동 이 선생에게 전화하지. 나 간다고.” “네, 알겠습니다.” 전재형 부회장이 삼청동이라고 부르는 곳은 바로 대대로 삼전 그룹에서 점을 봐온 곳이다. 삼전 그룹은 전주신 회장 때부터 특히 임직원을 뽑을 때는 관상과 사주를 봤다. “가능할 것 같습니다. 헌데, 부회장님. 뭐가 궁금하신 겁니까?” “흠….” 전재형 부회장은 잠시 뜸을 들였다. 사실 자신이 궁금한 것은 전성국이라는 아이와의 관계였다. 어떻게 이 아이가 자신이 가장 중요한 시점마다 나타나는지. 그리고 그 일들이 왜 삼전 전자에게 영향을 끼치는지 궁금했다. 삼풍백화점에서 자신의 목숨을 구한 것은 우연인지. 이 모든 게 막연히 궁금했다. “부회장님?” 전재형 부회장이 대답이 없자, 양 비서가 조용히 물었다. “성국이네 집에 연락해서 성국이 사주도 알아보게. 이번 삼풍백화점 일도 그렇고. 자꾸 그 아이랑 뭔가 연결된 거 같으니까, 이 일을 좀 정리하고 가야 할 것 같고… 아버지의 의중도 좀 알아봐야겠네.” “네, 부회장님.” 양 비서는 깍듯하게 인사를 하고 부회장실을 나왔다. 전재형은 성국이라는 아이와 엮이는 일마다 아슬아슬한 상황이 계속되는 것이 이상했다. 물론 지금까지는 모든 것이 삼전 전자에 유리했다. 하지만 앞으로 어떻게 될지는 아무도 몰랐다. 원래 악마는 사탕을 먼저 주지 않던가! * * * 전재형 부회장은 오래된 한옥으로 걸어 들어갔다. 마당에 놓인 아름드리 느티나무가 이 집의 역사를 알게 해줬다. 일반인들이 이 집에 드나들기 위해서는 예약을 하고도 1년 이상 기다려야 하는 곳이었다. 돈이나 권력으로도 순서를 바꿀 수는 없었다. 유일하게 대한민국에서 삼전 그룹만은 제외였다. 전재형 부회장은 정갈한 한옥의 정원을 지나서 댓돌에 신발을 벗고 마루로 올라갔다. 머리를 한 갈래로 곱게 빗은 여인이 아무 말 없이 조용히 안채로 안내했다. 점집이라기보다는 고급 요정의 분위기가 물씬 풍기는 곳이었다. 전재형 부회장의 방문 때문에 일반 고객들은 모두 취소하거나 돌려보낸 후라 내부는 적막할 정도로 고요했다. 맨 끝에 위치한 방 앞에 다다랐다. 여인이 문을 열자, 인자한 얼굴의 노인이 전재형 부회장에게 허리 굽혀 인사했다. 이 사람이 바로 이 선생이었다. “부회장님, 어서 오시지요.” 전재형 부회장은 이 선생 앞에 다소곳이 앉았다. 전재형 부회장이 좋아하는 국화차 향이 방 안에 가득했다. “차가 딱 적당히 우려졌네요.” 이 선생은 전재형 부회장의 차 뚜껑을 열었다. “어르신, 제가 부탁드린 사주 한번 보셨습니까?” “91년 9월 12일 신시생 사주 말이죠?” “네.” 전재형 부회장은 마시기 딱 좋게 우려진 국화차를 한 입 머금고 음미했다. 노인은 잠시 생각하더니, 전재형 부회장을 쳐다봤다. “부회장님, 이런 말씀 실례가 될지 모르겠지만요. 혹시 숨겨둔 아들 아닙니까?”","completion":"Episode 27 As I dozed off on the way, my consciousness gradually returned. Dr. Seo Byung-kwan, the friendly pediatrician who was my primary doctor during my childhood in my previous life, was treating me. Dr. Seo Byung-kwan frowned slightly and then looked at my mother. \\"Mother, did you feed him something wrong?\\" \\"I fed him rice as usual in the morning, and for a snack, he had a banana. With white milk. He's never had trouble after eating these.\\" Dr. Seo Byung-kwan tilted his head. \\"Did you feed Seong-guk any spicy kimchi?\\" My mother looked at me with a puzzled face. \\"Seong-guk, when did you eat kimchi?\\" \\"Kimchi. Tasty.\\" I grinned. After vomiting everything in my stomach and intestines in the bathroom of Sampoong Department Store and having a good sleep in Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's luxury sedan, my body was recovering. Dr. Seo Byung-kwan pinched my cheek. \\"This little one, you sneakily ate it when mom wasn't looking.\\" Grinning. I smiled broadly. My mother looked at me with a relieved face. \\"Doctor, is he okay now?\\" \\"Children who aren't used to spicy food often get sick from eating it by mistake. But this kid, how much kimchi did he eat?\\" Dr. Seo Byung-kwan clicked his tongue. While my mother was busy preparing for the shoot, I opened the fridge and stuffed my mouth with the bossam kimchi sold at my dad's restaurant. Honestly, I don't remember how much I ate. My goal was to eat as much as possible. And for a perfect crime, I washed my hands, applied baby lotion, and calmly waited for my mother. My mother still looked worried. \\"Doctor, this is really the first time something like this has happened. He usually can't handle spicy kimchi, so I always wash it with water before giving it to him.\\" \\"This kid will probably stay away from kimchi for a while after being scared today. But his condition isn't good today, so let's get him an IV. I'll also prescribe some medicine. Come back in about 3 days. I'll make an appointment for you.\\" \\"Thank you, Doctor.\\" My mother carried me to get an IV. A nurse looked at me and smiled. \\"Mother, is this the famous Seong-guk?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"The child is so pretty, no wonder, the mother is a beauty. You must be so happy to have such a son.\\" \\"He usually listens well, but I don't know why he ate kimchi today.\\" \\"Seong-guk still ate kimchi, though. There are so many kids who come in after eating something they shouldn't. No matter how well parents watch, kids can get into trouble in the blink of an eye.\\" \\"That's true. I'll have to be more careful in the future.\\" Then, pagers in the hospital started going off simultaneously. Beep- Beep- Beep- Beep- Beep-. \\"Oh, what's happening?\\" The nurse looked surprised too. My mother's pager also went off. \\"Dad contacted us.\\" Kim Mi-young arrived late with a pale face. \\"Sister, what's going on?\\" \\"Sampoong Department Store. Sampoong Department Store has...\\" Kim Mi-young couldn't finish her sentence. \\"Sister, what about Sampoong Department Store?\\" \\"...It collapsed.\\" \\"What?!\\" My mother screamed in shock. Then, the large TV in the lobby broadcasted the emergency news that Sampoong Department Store had collapsed. My mother's legs gave out, and she sat down on a hospital chair, still holding me. \\"Seong-guk's mom... Seong-guk's mom, are you okay?\\" \\"Sister... Seong-guk saved us.\\" * * * Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's face hardened as he walked through the garden of Samjeon Hospital. Secretary Yang also had a pale face. \\"Vice Chairman, Sampoong Department Store has collapsed.\\" \\"I just heard. What about the remaining executives?\\" \\"The employees of Sampoong Department Store were contacted in advance and evacuated. Since many of our company's employees live near Sampoong Department Store, we expect there to be family casualties.\\" \\"Let's go to the company.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung stopped walking suddenly. \\"By the way, how is Seong-guk?\\" \\"Dr. Seo Byung-kwan contacted us before the accident. He said Seong-guk had severe diarrhea and dehydration, but there's no serious problem.\\" \\"That's a relief.\\" \\"Vice Chairman, isn't it strange? We've been watching Seong-guk for 2 years, and he's never been late or fussed for a shoot. But today, of all days, he got diarrhea.\\" \\"...\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung walked on without a word. It was indeed strange. Since Seong-guk became involved, not only did the image of Samjeon Electronics change, but his own position became more solid. And today's event... it was something he could only believe was fate. Of course, the management staff of Sampoong Department Store had evacuated in advance, and he would have done the same, but that could have been criticized. However, thanks to Seong-guk, he had left the scene before any signs of the incident appeared. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung looked back at Secretary Yang. \\"First, let's donate to the Sampoong Department Store incident site and victims on behalf of the group, and look into other support measures.\\" \\"Yes, Vice Chairman.\\" \\"And, you know. Once things calm down a bit, how about we make today's event with Seong-guk a bit of an issue?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" Secretary Yang asked cautiously. \\"If we publicize the story of the baby model suddenly getting sick and using my car to go directly to Samjeon Hospital, and how this saved lives, it might help the image of Samjeon Group, don't you think?\\" \\"The incident is so big that there might be a backlash...\\" \\"Let's move carefully, watching the public's reaction.\\" \\"Yes, Vice Chairman.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung got into the car. Thud. The car door closed, and he placed his fingers on his forehead. Being involved with Seong-guk, there were times when he made decisions he couldn't understand himself. Today was one of those days. Normally, he would have just sent the child, but why did he accompany him to the hospital? But what was even stranger was that by doing so, Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung not only saved his life but also received a pardon for any potential problems. * * * Knock. Knock. Knock. The IV was being administered to my arm. In a single room provided by Samjeon Group, I was receiving an IV. After hearing about me, my dad and Lim Seon-mi rushed over with pale faces. \\"Seo-young, when I heard the store collapsed at the restaurant, I just sat down right there.\\" \\"Oppa, I'm sorry. Seong-guk was in such bad shape, I couldn't think of anything else.\\" My mother tried to call my dad after hearing his pager, but the line for the payphone was so long it took a while to get through. Actually, Lim Seon-mi was the most shocked. \\"It was really strange today. I've worked with Seong-guk for a long time, but this is the first time something like this has happened... If Samjeon hadn't canceled the schedule...\\" Lim Seon-mi's lips trembled. I lay on the bed with a heavy heart. This was all I could do. I couldn't change the fate of many people or alter history. My mother stroked my head. \\"Seong-guk, don't worry. Mom and dad are here.\\" [Ah, this damn shoddy construction. Mom, I've repaid my debt to you.] The day I first acknowledged this young couple flashed through my mind. The day mom carried me to the supermarket to buy bean sprouts. To protect me from a collapsing building, mom threw her whole body in front of me. And today, it was the opposite; I threw my stomach and intestines. [Ah, my stomach hurts.] My stomach and butt still stung from the spicy kimchi. The TV in the single room continuously showed the Sampoong Department Store collapse site. The building, which looked like it had been bombed, leaving only part of it standing, was a tragic sight. The cries of people searching for their missing family members. I closed my eyes for a moment. Then, the announcer on the screen mentioned that corporations and people from all over the country were sending donations to help with the disaster recovery. I quickly sat up. \\"Mom, me too.\\" \\"Seong-guk, what did you say?\\" \\"Me too, that.\\" I pointed at the TV screen showing the rising donation amount. \\"Seong-guk's mom, Seong-guk wants to donate.\\" Kim Mi-young quickly caught on. My mom and dad looked at each other and then nodded. Dad came over to me and held my hand tightly. \\"Seong-guk, dad will donate in Seong-guk's name tomorrow.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I nodded. * * * Five days had passed since the Sampoong Department Store incident. After the initial survivors were found, there was no further progress. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung flipped through a few morning newspapers. News of a miraculous survivor found among the devastated ruins and Seong-guk donating ten million won for the Sampoong Department Store disaster survivors was spreading. At the same time, the story of Seong-guk's day also came out. \\"Seong-guk Jeon was on his way to Sampoong Department Store for a Samjeon Electronics catalog shoot and fan signing event that afternoon. He suffered severe diarrhea and had to head to the hospital, which saved his life.\\" Stories of the popular group 'Just' attending the fan signing event but not the catalog shoot due to schedule issues, and stories of ordinary people narrowly avoiding the accident, followed in succession. Public outrage erupted over the revelation that Sampoong Department Store management staff had known about the accident in advance and evacuated. Now was the time to properly release the story of Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung and Seong-guk. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung immediately called Secretary Yang. Secretary Yang entered after knocking. \\"Vice Chairman, did you call for me?\\" \\"I think it would be good to release the story with Seong-guk to the media in a few days.\\" \\"I was about to suggest that too. Also, Seong-guk's family has made a request.\\" \\"A request? What request?\\" * * * The second Yuri Geller! I sighed heavily. As the search for the missing failed and attempts to hire psychics, shamans, and even the famous psychic Yuri Geller fell through, a blond boy from a strange country arrived, creating an unbelievable situation. \\"I feel energy here.\\" [I could do that too, you know!] Time passed, and people grew anxious. It wasn't that I didn't understand. The news repeatedly suggested that it might be time to conclude the search for the missing. \\"It's a waste of budget!\\" The rhetoric of politicians was predictable, then as now. [Tsk, tsk, tsk.] I couldn't just stand by and watch. After much thought, I decided to ask Kim Mi-young for help. Currently, Kim Mi-young was the most influential person I could turn to. Kim Mi-young came over for dinner one day, and as usual, the news was reporting on the Sampoong Department Store collapse. \\"It seems like no more survivors are being found.\\" \\"People searching are getting tired, and the aid is dwindling. Some are even saying it's time to wrap up the incident.\\" That's when I quickly grabbed Kim Mi-young's hand. \\"No way.\\" \\"Seong-guk, what did you say?\\" \\"No way. Absolutely no way.\\" \\"What are you talking about?\\" \\"People there. Waaah.\\" I burst into tears. Suddenly, my mom and Kim Mi-young looked at me. Kim Mi-young looked at me with a puzzled face. \\"Seong-guk, what do you mean?\\" \\"Search. Search. Samjeon. One. Two. Three. Four. Five more days!\\" \\"5 more days?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I nodded firmly. After some thought, Kim Mi-young called Secretary Yang of Samjeon Group. * * * \\"Seong-guk asked to extend the search for just 5 more days?\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" \\"A child?\\" \\"Maybe...\\" Secretary Yang hesitated. \\"Secretary Yang, call that person in Samcheong-dong. Tell them I'm coming.\\" \\"Yes, I understand.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung referred to a place in Samcheong-dong as the home of a fortune-teller who had been consulting for Samjeon Group for generations. Since the time of Chairman Jeon Shin, Samjeon Group particularly relied on physiognomy and fortune-telling when hiring employees. \\"It seems possible. But, Vice Chairman, may I ask what you're curious about?\\" \\"Hmm...\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung paused for a moment. Actually, he was curious about his relationship with Seong-guk Jeon. How did this child appear at the most crucial moments? And why did those events affect Samjeon Electronics? Was saving his life at Sampoong Department Store a coincidence? He was curious about all of it. \\"Vice Chairman?\\" When Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung didn't respond, Secretary Yang quietly asked. \\"Contact Seong-guk's family and find out his birth chart too. With this Sampoong Department Store incident and all, it feels like we're somehow connected to that child, so we need to sort this out... and also check my father's intentions.\\" \\"Yes, Vice Chairman.\\" Secretary Yang bowed respectfully and left the Vice Chairman's office. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung found it strange that every time he was involved with Seong-guk, they narrowly escaped dangerous situations. So far, everything had been in favor of Samjeon Electronics. But no one knew what the future held. After all, doesn't the devil always offer candy first? * * * Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung walked into an old Hanok. The majestic zelkova tree in the yard spoke of the house's history. For ordinary people to visit this house, they had to wait for over a year even with a reservation. Money or power couldn't change the order of things here. Only Samjeon Group was an exception in South Korea. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung walked through the neatly kept Hanok garden, took off his shoes on the stepping stone, and stepped onto the porch. A woman with neatly combed hair silently led him to the inner quarters. The place felt more like a high-end salon than a fortune-telling house. Because of Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's visit, all other customers were either canceled or sent away, making the inside eerily quiet. They reached the room at the very end. As the woman opened the door, a kind-faced elderly man bowed deeply to Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. This was the person known as Teacher Lee. \\"Vice Chairman, welcome.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung sat down modestly in front of Teacher Lee. The room was filled with the fragrance of chrysanthemum tea, which Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung liked. \\"The tea is perfectly brewed.\\" Teacher Lee opened the lid of Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's tea. \\"Elder, did you have a chance to look at the birth chart I asked about?\\" \\"The one born on September 12, 1991, at the hour of the monkey?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung took a sip of the chrysanthemum tea, which was brewed just right, and savored it. The elder paused for a moment, then looked at Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. \\"Vice Chairman, I hope you don't mind me asking, but could he be your hidden son?\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Es un factor imprescindible para que la planta pueda llevar a cabo la fotosíntesis y de la que depende directamente para sintetizar la materia orgánica a partir de sustancias minerales. La luz provee la energía necesaria para que la planta realice la fotosíntesis, con la cual se produce la materia orgánica para su crecimiento y desarrollo. La actividad fotosintética y su eficacia aumenta con la luz, la temperatura y el CO2, por lo que si se quiere conseguir un buen desarrollo del cultivo y un incremento de la productividad, hay que garantizar un buena y correcta iluminación. Cuanto mayor es la iluminación, más eficaz es la fotosíntesis y más rápido se puede llegar a desarrollar la planta. Sin embargo, a medida que la intensidad de la luz aumenta, la velocidad de la fotosíntesis alcanza un límite. A este punto máximo se le denomina “punto de saturación de la luz”, a partir del cual la velocidad del proceso físico-químico de la fotosíntesis se vuelve plana. La cantidad de luz recibida por la planta dependerá de dos factores principalmente; de la intensidad y del número de horas diarias de exposición. A los cambios de iluminación que reciben las plantas se denomina fotoperiodo, y el tiempo de exposición o las horas de luz necesarios para que el cultivo pueda desarrollarse y llegar a la floración, varía según la especie. Todas las plantas necesitan luz y por debajo de un determinado umbral, muy pocas consiguen subsistir. Pero tanto el exceso como la falta de luz ocasiona en las plantas consecuencias nocivas. Las plantas que reciben insuficientes niveles de luz tienen menor crecimiento vegetativo, menor floración, se debilitan y producen hojas más pequeñas. Por otro lado, las plantas que reciben demasiada luz pueden producir lo que se denomina clorosis (La clorosis es el amarillamiento del tejido foliar causado por la falta de clorofila).

All of a sudden, a large puff of pink smoke appears and a giant, red, winged demon appears! The man jumps onto the moving beam and as the demon swipes at him, it leaves a handprint that has burned right through the metal! Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby are eating dinner and reading an article about a demon sighting on a large construction site; it has been the fifth sighting so far. The gang decides to pay the site a visit to try and solve the mystery. They talk with the owner, Mr. Crenshaw, whose office has just been vandalized by the demons. He claims they were after an ancient talisman that is used to be able to drive demons back underground. Daphne finds a matchbook with the words \\"Crow's Nest\\" on it, and Sam Crenshaw explains that the Crow's Nest is a waterfront hotel. The gang go to the Crow's Nest hotel and speak with the manager, Sally. She claims that the demons are terrorizing her as well. A sailor named Albert Tross appears and tells the gang that the demons prowl the docks at night, and that is where the gang head next. On the docks, they split up. Shaggy and Scooby end up chased by the demons and meet up with the gang, telling their story. Sally shows up and frantically tells Mystery Inc. that the demons have taken Albert. The gang go down to Sally's basement, which contains the entrance to the underground city. They enter the city, and look around, but get separated. Scooby and Shaggy have a run-in with the demons again, and Fred, Daphne and Velma find a steel lid leading underground, where supposedly the demons escaped from, but it is sealed tight. Shaggy and Scooby meet up with Fred and the girls, and the five sleuths come upon a wax museum, full of wax statues of classic movie monsters (werewolves, a mummy, etc.) and they discover a demon exhibit-and one of the demon statues are missing. Daphne gets nabbed by a demon, and the gang split up to look for her. Shaggy and Scooby enter an old music store, where they find Daphne stuffed inside a piano. Velma and Fred find an old drugstore and Velma discovers one of the bottles have been recently tampered with. The bottle breaks and releases a pink gas, the same pink gas that appears when the demons show up. Shaggy, Scooby and Daphne meet up with Fred and Velma. Suddenly, the demon appears and chases the gang. They drive back to the construction site to find Mr. Crenshaw's office destroyed and Mr. Crenshaw missing. After returning to the underground city, the gang managed to lose the demons that was pursuing them and stumble upon a cable car roundhouse. The demons appear again, and Shaggy and Scooby hop onto a cable car and the demon chases them around the cable car. After a period of time, the cable car crashes and Scooby and Shaggy flee and hide in an old movie set, where they fall through a trapdoor, crashing into Velma, Daphne and Fred and they slam through an old wall, back into the wax museum-where all of the demon statues are missing. The gang comes up with a plan. They set up some of the monster statues on the cable car rails and operate them along the rails, chasing the demon into an underground secret tunnel. They follow the tunnel and end up in Sally's basement where Albert Tross appears. Scooby also accidentally discovers a chest full of coins -- Albert Tross is the culprit! The gang chase him, and finally trap him. They pull off his face to reveal Sam Crenshaw underneath. His get-up was Albert Tross; he used him to be able to get into the underground city in Sally's basement. But when the gang found the matchbook and connected him to the Crow's Nest, he had to make Tross disappear, too. The sizzling handprints and the red smoke was made using the medicine in the pharmacy, and he was stealing treasure from the underground city. Also, he stole demon statues from the wax museum and hooked them up to the cable cars to make it look like demons were running amok. Back at the diner, Scooby opens his meal tray and immediately hides underneath the table because he saw smoke coming out of it and thought the demon was coming back for revenge, but Fred tells Scooby that it's only a cooked lobster. The gang then start laughing about it and so does Scooby.","completion":"Title: Scooby-Doo and the Demon of the Docks --- [The scene begins with a night at the bustling construction site.

All of a sudden, a large puff of pink smoke appears and a giant, red, winged demon appears! The man jumps onto the moving beam and as the demon swipes at him, it leaves a handprint that has burned right through the metal! Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby are eating dinner and reading an article about a demon sighting on a large construction site; it has been the fifth sighting so far. The gang decides to pay the site a visit to try and solve the mystery. They talk with the owner, Mr. Crenshaw, whose office has just been vandalized by the demons. He claims they were after an ancient talisman that is used to be able to drive demons back underground. Daphne finds a matchbook with the words \\"Crow's Nest\\" on it, and Sam Crenshaw explains that the Crow's Nest is a waterfront hotel. The gang go to the Crow's Nest hotel and speak with the manager, Sally. She claims that the demons are terrorizing her as well. A sailor named Albert Tross appears and tells the gang that the demons prowl the docks at night, and that is where the gang head next. On the docks, they split up. Shaggy and Scooby end up chased by the demons and meet up with the gang, telling their story. Sally shows up and frantically tells Mystery Inc. that the demons have taken Albert. The gang go down to Sally's basement, which contains the entrance to the underground city. They enter the city, and look around, but get separated. Scooby and Shaggy have a run-in with the demons again, and Fred, Daphne and Velma find a steel lid leading underground, where supposedly the demons escaped from, but it is sealed tight. Shaggy and Scooby meet up with Fred and the girls, and the five sleuths come upon a wax museum, full of wax statues of classic movie monsters (werewolves, a mummy, etc.) and they discover a demon exhibit-and one of the demon statues are missing. Daphne gets nabbed by a demon, and the gang split up to look for her. Shaggy and Scooby enter an old music store, where they find Daphne stuffed inside a piano. Velma and Fred find an old drugstore and Velma discovers one of the bottles have been recently tampered with. The bottle breaks and releases a pink gas, the same pink gas that appears when the demons show up. Shaggy, Scooby and Daphne meet up with Fred and Velma. Suddenly, the demon appears and chases the gang. They drive back to the construction site to find Mr. Crenshaw's office destroyed and Mr. Crenshaw missing. After returning to the underground city, the gang managed to lose the demons that was pursuing them and stumble upon a cable car roundhouse. The demons appear again, and Shaggy and Scooby hop onto a cable car and the demon chases them around the cable car. After a period of time, the cable car crashes and Scooby and Shaggy flee and hide in an old movie set, where they fall through a trapdoor, crashing into Velma, Daphne and Fred and they slam through an old wall, back into the wax museum-where all of the demon statues are missing. The gang comes up with a plan. They set up some of the monster statues on the cable car rails and operate them along the rails, chasing the demon into an underground secret tunnel. They follow the tunnel and end up in Sally's basement where Albert Tross appears. Scooby also accidentally discovers a chest full of coins -- Albert Tross is the culprit! The gang chase him, and finally trap him. They pull off his face to reveal Sam Crenshaw underneath. His get-up was Albert Tross; he used him to be able to get into the underground city in Sally's basement. But when the gang found the matchbook and connected him to the Crow's Nest, he had to make Tross disappear, too. The sizzling handprints and the red smoke was made using the medicine in the pharmacy, and he was stealing treasure from the underground city. Also, he stole demon statues from the wax museum and hooked them up to the cable cars to make it look like demons were running amok. Back at the diner, Scooby opens his meal tray and immediately hides underneath the table because he saw smoke coming out of it and thought the demon was coming back for revenge, but Fred tells Scooby that it's only a cooked lobster. The gang then start laughing about it and so does Scooby.","completion":"**Title: Scooby-Doo and the Demon of Laughter** [Scene: The construction site at night, ambient sounds of construction echo.

They meet Mr. Crenshaw.] **Mr. Crenshaw:** Those darn demons are after the ancient talisman. Or maybe my secret recipe. **Velma:** (skeptically) A secret recipe?

They’ve been rearranging the furniture and not in a good way. **Fred:** That's monstrous! [Albert Tross appears, a bit too dramatically.] **Albert:** The demons prowl the docks at night!

[이럴 땐 짜장면이나 먹어야지.] 나는 있는 힘껏 면발을 빨아 당겼다. 호로록. 호로록. 호로록. 엄마가 당황한 채 말을 잇지 못했다. “저희가 그 큰 것을 받아도 될지….” “부회장님, 좋은 제안 너무 감사드립니다. 성국이 아버님이랑도 상의해봐야 하니 양 비서님 통해서 자세한 제안 주시면, 저희가 고민해보고 답 드려도 될까요?” 김미영 매니저가 깔끔하게 정리했다. 역시 이런 일은 제3자의 눈으로 볼 때 더 정확했다. 전재형 부회장은 고개를 끄덕였다. “물론이죠. 아버님이랑 당연히 상의해 보셔야죠. 제가 식사도 못 하시게 했네요. 그럼, 이제 편하게 식사하시죠. 성국이는 이미 잘 먹는 것 같지만요.” “따땅면. 마시떠요.” 나는 엄지까지 치켜세웠다. 전재형 부회장은 나를 보며 묘한 미소를 지었다. [저 미소의 의미는 뭐지?] 그때, 양 비서가 들고 있던 핸드폰이 요란하게 울렸다. 양 비서가 조용히 구석에서 전화를 받더니 황급히 전재형 부회장에게 다가와 뭐라 속삭였다. 전재형 부회장은 최대한 표정을 숨긴 채 급히 인사를 했다. “회사에 문제가 생겨서 가봐야 할 것 같습니다. 말씀대로 성국 군 일은 양 비서 통해서 알려 주시고요, 다음에 다시 저녁 식사 자리 한번 만들겠습니다.” 다급한 상황에서도 전재형 부회장은 예의를 잃지 않았다. 그리고 조용히 룸을 빠져나갔다.

[삼전 그룹 회장 죽었다고 대한민국 경제 안 망해.] 뉴스 화면에는 굳은 얼굴의 전재형 부회장과 남동생의 얼굴이 연이어 비쳤다. 전주신 회장의 유언대로 전재형 부회장이 그룹의 총수 자리를 맡게 된다는 소식이 이어지고, 정재계의 조문 행렬이 이어졌다. 엄마가 다가오더니, 내 입에 바나나를 밀어 넣었다. “성국아, 아침에 일어나자마자 뉴스야?” “아저띠!” 나는 TV에 나온 전재형 부회장을 손가락으로 가리켰다. “어, 아저씨 아버지가 오늘 하늘나라로 떠나셨대. 정말, 삼전 그룹 어쩌니.” [엄마, 엄마는 SKJ 기획과 우리 가족 걱정이나 해. 재벌 걱정은 하는 게 아니야.] 진짜 대한민국 사람들은 좀 특이했다. 집집마다 삼전 전자 가전제품 하나 정도는 있고, 건너 아는 누군가 한 명은 삼전 그룹에 다녔다. 그래서 마치 삼전에 무슨 일이 생기면 내 일처럼 걱정하기도, 질타하기도 했다. “엄마, 밥!” “참, 성국아. 오늘 아빠 가게 구경 가자. 아빠가 이따가 너랑 민국이 다 데리고 구경 오라고 했어.” “좋아!” 나는 엉덩이를 슬쩍 씰룩여줬다. 엄마가 웃으며 엉덩이를 토닥였다. “성국이 때문에 엄마가 웃어.” [당연하지!] 진짜 이번 생에서는 생존 스킬만 만렙이 되어가는 중이었다. * * * “흠….” 나는 뒷짐을 진 채 아빠 가게를 올려다봤다. 막 아저씨들이 간판을 붙이고 있었다. “성국아, 민국아. 아빠 가게야.” “원아저띠 보쌈. 잠실점.” 나는 간판을 또박또박 읽었다. 이제 내가 글을 스스로 깨친 것에 대해서 가족들은 무난히 받아들였다. 이게 나, 전성국이라서 가능한 일인 것을 이들은 알기나 알까. 나는 아직 말도 제대로 못 하는 민국이 녀석을 내려다봤다. [부모님이 널 가르쳐보면 알 거야. 형이 얼마나 천재인지.] 민국이는 뭐가 좋은지 나만 보면 히죽히죽 웃어댔다. [내가 웃으면 정든다고 웃지 말라고 했지!] “형, 조아.” 민국이는 내 손을 이미 입안에 넣고 쪽쪽 빨고 있었다. [엄마, 아빠 바쁘니까 말썽 부리면 안 돼. 형 손가락이나 빨아.] “응!” [암튼 대답은 잘해요.] 나는 한 손을 민국이에게 준 채 가게를 살폈다. 10평 정도 되는 작은 사이즈에 주방이 절반 가까이 차지해서 테이블은 네 개밖에 없었다. 아빠는 전에 이야기한 대로 포장 전문 보쌈 가게를 차렸다. “자, 돼지 머리 왔어요!” 김미영이 한없이 인자한 미소를 짓고 있는 돼지 머리를 들고 들어왔다. [고사 지내나 보구나.] 나는 주머니를 뒤적거렸다. 다행히 촬영장에서 스태프 누나들에게 받은 용돈 몇천 원이 나왔다. 나는 주로 커팅 행사를 했지만, 고사도 종종 지내서 어떻게 해야 하는지는 알았다. 떡까지 배달 오고 나니, 이제 제법 고사상다운 모습이 완성됐다. <원아저씨 보쌈>의 수유 본점 대표님까지 오고 나니 작은 가게 안이 꽉 찼다. “자, 어서 대표 먼저 절해야지!” 수유 본점 대표님의 재촉에 아빠가 쑥스러워하며 앞으로 나가 절을 하고, 잠시 기도하는 모습을 하더니 주머니에서 준비한 흰 봉투를 꺼내 인자한 돼지 입속에 쏙 넣었다. “자, 이젠 내가 해야지. 정말 원아저씨 보쌈 대박 나게 해주세요!” 수유 본점 대표님도 인사를 하고, 김미영이 나서려는 순간, 내가 손을 확 들었다. “저요!” “성국아, 네가 한다고?” “녜에!” 모두들 웃으며 나를 지켜봤고, 나는 저번 생의 기억을 더듬어서 제법 의젓하게 절도 하고 주머니에서 미리 준비한 천 원짜리도 돼지 입에 쏙 넣었다. 그러자 모두 박수와 함께 웃음을 터트렸다. “역시 우리 스타는 달라.” <원아저씨 보쌈> 아저씨가 달려와서 나를 안으려고 해서 몸을 슬쩍 피해 엄마 뒤로 달려갔다. 그리고 엄마 뒤에서 까르르 웃으면서 사람들을 바라봤다. 엄마가 나를 보며 연신 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 잘했어.” “엄마….” [왜 마음이 몰캉거리지?] 이런 거 잘해도 칭찬보다는 비판받는 일이 더 많았다. 항상 뭐가 부족했다며 철의 여인은 지적을 했고, 장난치고 도망가서 숨을 엄마의 뒤는 내 기억 속엔 없었다. [아빠, 엄마….] “혀엉?” 민국이가 내 손을 침 범벅인 손으로 꼭 잡았다. [민국아… 뭐야… 왜 다들 나한테 따뜻한 건데…. 내가 뭐 잘했다고, 이게 뭐라고 다들 웃고 좋아하는 건데!] 나는 순간 울컥해서 울음을 터트리고 말았다. 엄마가 나를 안아 들어서는 등을 토닥였다. “성국아, 우리가 웃어서 놀랐어? 너 놀리는 거 아니고, 다들 너 귀여워서 그래.” [나도 안다고… 나도 다….] <원아저씨 보쌈> 수유 본점 사장님도 어느새 곁에 와서 만 원을 내보였다. “아이고, 이 녀석. 아저씨가 과자 사먹게 용돈 주려고 했는데, 안 되겠네.” [고작 만 원이잖아.] 하지만 나는 손을 뻗어 만 원을 악착같이 잡았다. [티끌 모아 티끌이 아니라 태산도 될 수 있다는 것을 내가 증명해 보이겠어!] 만 원을 잡고 미간을 팍 찡그린 내 얼굴을 본 가게 안의 사람들이 모두 또 웃어재꼈다. “성국아, 기분 풀렸어?” “녜에, 엄마!” 엄마가 내 엉덩이를 토닥였다. * * * “자기야, 성국이 유치원 어떻게 하지? 근방에 몇 군데 대기 넣어놨는데, 다들 연락이 없네.” “소영아, 성국이 유치원 보내지 말까?” 쫑긋. 나는 뉴스를 보다가 아빠의 말에 귀를 기울였다. [아빠, 좋은 생각이야. 나 유치원 가도 배울 게 하나도 없어. 내가 누차 말하지만, 나 6개 국어 한다고 말했나? 이제 영어도 하고, 중국어랑 일본어도 좀 해볼까? 이러면 곤란한데…. 나 또 영재 발굴 프로, 이런 거에 나가라는 거 아니야? 너무 잘난 것도 힘들군….] 도리도리. “성국아, 뭔 말을 혼자 중얼거려?” 아빠가 나를 보며 웃었다. “아빠, 유치원 시로.” “소영아, 성국이도 유치원 싫다잖아.” “애가 뭘 알아. 자기가 그러니까 성국이도 덩달아 그러잖아. 유치원 다녀야 사회생활도 배우고, 친구도 생기지. 새 동네라 동네 친구도 없는데….” “그렇긴 하지. 나도 어릴 적에 유치원 졸업 사진, 집에 걸린 애들 보면서 엄청 부러워했어.” 아빠가 엄마의 등을 도닥였다. “참, 자기야. 요즘 매출은 어때?” “입소문 나서 조금씩 오르는 추세야. 배달이랑 포장 위주라 그런지 오히려 전에 가게보다 손님 스트레스도 덜하고, 편한 것 같아.” “자기야, 나도 우리 성국이 덕분에 돈 벌고, 자기도 보쌈집 사장님이고. 우리 이러다가 재벌 되는 거 아니야?” 엄마가 환하게 미소를 지었다. [엄마, 재벌은 아무나 되는 줄 알아? 그래도 걱정은 마. 내가 있잖아.] 마침 뉴스에서는 삼전 그룹의 후계 계승이 마무리됐단 소식이 흘러나왔다. 전주신 회장의 유언대로 장남인 전재형 부회장이 정식으로 회장 직함을 달고 출근했고, 남동생인 전재진은 계열사 하나를 가지고 분리 독립했다는 소식도 전했다. [작은아버지, 나중에 저것도 말아먹지. 쯧쯧.] 후계 구도가 정리되면서 전주신 회장 사후 잠시 떨어졌던 삼전 전자 주식도 상승했다. “소영아, 삼전 주식 또 올랐어. 성국이 이러다가 나중에 우리보다 부자 되겠는데.” [겨우 그 정도 가지고 부자는….] 나는 아장아장 걸어서 부엌으로 향했다. 투 룸에서 살다가 34평으로 이사 오니 한결 숨통이 트이는 느낌이었다. 안방에서는 민국이 녀석이 세상 태평하게 자고 있었다. 나는 내 책상이 놓인 방으로 아장아장 걸어갔다. 그리고 이전에 산 <맨큐의 경제학>을 꺼내 들었다. [오랜만에 읽어보는군.] 나는 한 장 한 장 넘기면서 잊고 있었던 기초들을 새삼 기억해냈다. 이때, 전화벨 소리가 들렸다. 곧 아빠가 전화를 받았다. “양 비서님, 어쩐 일이세요? 아, 네….” 양 비서라고? 나는 귀를 쫑긋했다. “성국이 유치원 구하기가 쉽지는 않네요. 이런 것까지 신경 써주시고, 감사합니다.” 전화를 끊은 아빠는 의아한 얼굴로 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “소영아, 양 비서님이 우리 성국이 유치원 어떻게 되는 거냐고 물으시는데.” “참, 깜빡했다. 자기야, 나 애를 둘이나 낳고 났더니 완전 깜빡이야.” “뭘 깜빡한 거야?” “저번에 성국이 삼전 전자 카탈로그 마지막으로 촬영한 날, 전재형 부회장님이. 아니지, 이제 회장님이지. 아무튼 회장님이 성국이가 삼풍백화점 붕괴 때 자기 목숨 구해준 거나 마찬가지라고 평생 교육 책임지시겠다고 했어. 나중에 대학은 물론 유학까지 모두 다. 그리고 삼전 그룹에 특별 채용도 제안하셨어.” “그걸 깜빡하면 어떡해!” “미안. 당신 가게 개업에 정신없었잖아. 그리고 나는 사실 이런 게 진짜 일어나는 일인가 싶어.” 엄마는 여전히 못 미더운 눈치였다. [엄마, 삼전 그룹 사람들은 한 번 입은 은혜는 수십 배로 갚고, 한 번 입은 원수는 수천 배로 갚아.] “성국이 유치원까지 혹시 관리해주실 생각이신가. 삼전 그룹이라고 해도 대기를 뚫고 들어갈 수는 없잖아. 그건 편법이지. 소영아, 만약에 양 비서님이 그렇게 해주신다고 해도 우리 그런 건 하지 말자.” “당연하지, 자기야. 나도 성국이가 첫 단추부터 편법에 길들여지는 건 싫어.” [역시 엄마, 아빠가 생각은 바른데 말이야. 엄마, 아빠. 세상은 편법으로 돌아가는 거야.] 나는 책을 천천히 넘겼다. 그때 문득 내가 어릴 적 다닌 유치원이 떠올랐다. 삼전 그룹에서 만든 삼전 유치원. 말로는 그룹 내 맞벌이 부부를 위한 유치원이었지만, 그 안에 특별반이 하나 있었다. 바로 나와 같은 후계자 및 정재계 자녀들이 다니는 반이었다. 이 반에 속한 아이들은 특별 교육을 받는 그런 시스템이었다. [잠깐, 그럼 나 유치원 가야 하는 거야?]","completion":"Episode 29 I grumbled to myself. I knew exactly how much wealth and slush funds the Samjeon Group had, but pretending to know anything about it at five years old would be pointless since no one would understand me. [This is a time for black bean noodles.] I slurped the noodles with all my might. Slurp. Slurp. Slurp. My mom was at a loss for words, flustered. \\"Are we really okay to accept such a big offer...\\" \\"Vice Chairman, thank you so much for the generous offer. We'll need to discuss it with Seonguk's father and get back to you through Secretary Yang with our decision, if that's okay?\\" Manager Kim Miyoung wrapped things up neatly. Indeed, viewing these matters through a third party's perspective was more accurate. Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung nodded. \\"Of course. You should definitely discuss it with his father. I've kept you from eating. Please, enjoy your meal now. Seonguk seems to be enjoying his already.\\" \\"Black bean noodles. Delicious.\\" I gave a thumbs up. Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung smiled at me mysteriously. [What does that smile mean?] Then, Secretary Yang's phone, which he was holding, started ringing loudly. Secretary Yang quietly stepped aside to take the call, then hurriedly whispered something to Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung. Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung, trying his best to hide his expression, quickly said his goodbyes. \\"I need to attend to an issue at the company. As we discussed, please let me know about Seonguk's matter through Secretary Yang, and we'll arrange another dinner meeting next time.\\" Even in a rush, Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung did not lose his manners and quietly left the room. [Is today that day?] The day Chairman Jeon Jushin of Samjeon Group collapsed. The day I died, the day my heart painfully tore apart. I remembered my grandfather's death. He had watered his beloved garden trees on a summer afternoon as usual, came into the living room, took a nap, and never woke up. Forever. It must have been a myocardial infarction, just like my cause of death. Suddenly, the black bean noodles lost their taste. I put down my fork and reached for a napkin to wipe my mouth. \\"Seonguk, aren't you eating anymore?\\" Mom seemed a bit surprised. \\"Mom!\\" \\"Yes, Seonguk?\\" \\"Let's go home.\\" \\"Alright, let's just eat this and go home with mom and the manager.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I nodded and yawned lazily. Whether it was because I was full or the tension from the shoot was finally easing, I was suddenly overwhelmed with sleepiness. * * * I woke up the next morning. Immediately, I went to the bathroom, then skillfully turned on the TV. By now, I could easily turn the TV on and off without anyone's help. The news was, of course, covering the death of Chairman Jeon Jushin of Samjeon Group as the main story. All the news channels were making a fuss as if the South Korean economy would shake just because the chairman of Samjeon Group had died. [The South Korean economy won't collapse just because the chairman of Samjeon Group is dead.] The news showed the stern faces of Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung and his younger brother in succession. Following Chairman Jeon Jushin's will, Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung was announced to take over as the head of the group, and a series of condolences from the political and business communities followed. Mom came over and stuffed a banana into my mouth. \\"Seonguk, watching the news as soon as you wake up?\\" \\"Daddy!\\" I pointed at Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung on the TV. \\"Oh, that uncle's father went to heaven today. Really, what will happen to Samjeon Group.\\" [Mom, you should worry about SKJ Planning and our family, not about conglomerates.] People in South Korea were indeed peculiar. Almost every household had at least one Samjeon Electronics appliance, and someone they knew worked for Samjeon Group. So, it felt like their own business when something happened to Samjeon, worrying and criticizing as if it were their own issue. \\"Mom, food!\\" \\"Right, Seonguk. Let's go see dad's store today. Dad said he'd take you and Minkuk to see it later.\\" \\"Yay!\\" I wiggled my bottom slightly. Mom laughed and patted my bottom. \\"Mom smiles because of Seonguk.\\" [Of course!] In this life, it seemed like I was only leveling up my survival skills. * * * \\"Hmm...\\" I looked up at dad's store with my hands behind my back. Men were just finishing up hanging the sign. \\"Seonguk, Minkuk. This is dad's store.\\" \\"Won Uncle's Bossam. Jamsil Branch.\\" I read the sign out loud. By now, my family had casually accepted that I had taught myself to read. Did they even realize that this was possible because I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>? I looked down at Minkuk, who couldn't even speak properly yet. [If our parents tried teaching you, they'd realize how much of a genius your brother is.] Minkuk just grinned at me whenever he saw me. [I told you not to smile because it makes you likable!] \\"Bro, good.\\" Minkuk was already sucking on my finger. [Mom, dad, I shouldn't cause trouble since you're busy. I'll just suck on my brother's finger.] \\"Okay!\\" [At least you respond well.] Holding one hand out to Minkuk, I surveyed the store. It was a small size of about 10 pyeong, with the kitchen taking up almost half of it, leaving space for only four tables. Dad had opened a bossam (Korean boiled pork) store specializing in takeout, as he had mentioned before. \\"Here comes the pig's head!\\" Kim Miyoung entered with a pig's head, smiling endlessly. [Looks like they're performing a ritual.] I rummaged through my pockets. Luckily, I found a few thousand won that staff sisters at the shooting site had given me as pocket money. I had mostly participated in cutting ceremonies, but I had also attended a few rituals, so I knew what to do. Once the rice cakes were delivered, completing the look of a proper ritual table. With the arrival of the representative of Won Uncle's Bossam's Suyu main branch, the small store was packed. \\"Come on, the representative should bow first!\\" Urged by the representative of the Suyu main branch, dad shyly stepped forward, bowed, and after a moment of prayer, he took out a prepared white envelope and neatly placed it into the generous pig's mouth. \\"Now, it's my turn. Please make Won Uncle's Bossam a big hit!\\" The representative of the Suyu main branch also paid his respects, and just as Kim Miyoung was about to step forward, I raised my hand high. \\"Me!\\" \\"Seonguk, you want to do it?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Everyone watched me with smiles as I, recalling my past life's memories, performed a rather dignified bow and even placed a prepared 1,000 won note into the pig's mouth. Then, everyone burst into applause and laughter. \\"Our star is different.\\" The owner of Won Uncle's Bossam rushed over to hug me, but I swiftly dodged and ran behind my mom, giggling and looking at everyone from there. Mom kept patting my head. \\"Seonguk, well done.\\" \\"Mom...\\" [Why does my heart feel so warm?] I was used to receiving more criticism than praise for doing well. The Iron Lady always pointed out what was lacking, and hiding behind my mom after playing pranks was not something I remembered. [Dad, mom...] \\"Huh?\\" Minkuk tightly held my saliva-covered hand. [Minkuk... Why... Why is everyone so warm to me... What did I do to deserve all this laughter and happiness!] Suddenly, I burst into tears. Mom picked me up and patted my back. \\"Seonguk, did you get scared because we laughed? We're not making fun of you, everyone just finds you adorable.\\" [I know... I know all that...] The owner of Won Uncle's Bossam's Suyu main branch also came over and showed a 10,000 won note. \\"Oh dear, this little one. I was going to give you some pocket money to buy snacks, but it seems that won't do.\\" [It's just 10,000 won.] But I reached out and grabbed the 10,000 won note as if my life depended on it. [I'll show you that even dust can become a mountain if gathered!] Holding the 10,000 won note and scrunching up my face, everyone in the store laughed again. \\"Seonguk, are you feeling better?\\" \\"Yes, mom!\\" Mom patted my bottom. * * * \\"Honey, what should we do about Seonguk's kindergarten? I've put us on the waiting list for a few places nearby, but no one has contacted us.\\" \\"Dear, how about we don't send Seonguk to kindergarten?\\" I perked up. I stopped watching the news and listened to dad's words. [Dad, that's a great idea. There's nothing for me to learn in kindergarten. I've mentioned it before, but did I tell you I speak six languages? Maybe I should start learning English, Chinese, and Japanese too. This could be problematic... I'm not supposed to end up on some genius discovery show, right? Being too talented can be tough...] Shaking my head. \\"Seonguk, what are you mumbling to yourself?\\" Dad looked at me and smiled. \\"Dad, no kindergarten.\\" \\"Dear, Seonguk doesn't want to go to kindergarten either.\\" \\"Kids don't know what's best for them. You're the reason Seonguk is acting like this. Kindergarten is important for learning social skills and making friends. We're in a new neighborhood, and he doesn't have any local friends...\\" \\"That's true. I was always jealous of kids with kindergarten graduation photos hanging in their homes when I was young.\\" Dad comforted mom by patting her back. \\"By the way, dear, how are the sales lately?\\" \\"It's slowly increasing thanks to word of mouth. Since it's mainly delivery and takeout, it's less stressful than the previous store, and it feels more comfortable.\\" \\"Dear, I'm making money thanks to our Seonguk, and you're the boss of a bossam store. Are we becoming conglomerates?\\" Mom smiled brightly. [Mom, becoming a conglomerate isn't something just anyone can do. But don't worry, I'm here.] The news was now reporting that the succession of Samjeon Group had been finalized. As per Chairman Jeon Jushin's will, Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung officially took the position of chairman and went to work, and his younger brother Jeon Jaejin took over one of the affiliates and became independent. [Little uncle, you'll probably squander that too. Tsk tsk.] With the succession issue settled, Samjeon Electronics' stock, which had briefly fallen after Chairman Jeon Jushin's death, was on the rise again. \\"Dear, Samjeon's stock has risen again. Seonguk might become richer than us in the future.\\" [Just that amount and you think it's wealth...] I toddled off to the kitchen. Moving from a two-room to a 34-pyeong apartment felt like a breath of fresh air. In the master bedroom, Minkuk was sleeping peacefully as if he owned the world. I walked into the room where my desk and books were. Then, I took out \\"Mankiw's Principles of Economics.\\" [It's been a while since I've read this.] I flipped through the pages, recalling the basics I had forgotten. Then, the phone rang. Dad soon answered the call. \\"Secretary Yang, what's the matter? Ah, yes...\\" Secretary Yang? I pricked up my ears. \\"It's not easy to find a kindergarten for Seonguk. Thank you for taking care of even this.\\" After hanging up, dad looked puzzled at mom. \\"Dear, Secretary Yang asked about Seonguk's kindergarten.\\" \\"Oh, I completely forgot. Honey, ever since I had two kids, I've become so forgetful.\\" \\"What did you forget?\\" \\"That day, the last day Seonguk shot the Samjeon Electronics catalog, Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung. No, now he's the chairman. Anyway, the chairman said that Seonguk practically saved his life during the Sampoong Department Store collapse and promised to take responsibility for his education for life. He said he would cover everything from college to studying abroad and even offered a special position at Samjeon Group.\\" \\"How could you forget that!\\" \\"Sorry. I was so busy with your store opening. And honestly, I wasn't sure if this was really happening.\\" Mom still seemed unconvinced. [Mom, people at Samjeon Group repay a favor a hundredfold and a grudge a thousandfold.] \\"Dear, if Secretary Yang really takes care of Seonguk's kindergarten, let's not go through with it. Even if it's Samjeon Group, bypassing the waitlist is unfair. That's taking advantage.\\" \\"Of course, honey. I don't want Seonguk to start off on the wrong foot with shortcuts.\\" [Of course, mom and dad are morally upright. But mom, dad, the world operates on shortcuts.] I continued flipping through the book. Suddenly, I remembered the kindergarten I attended as a child. The Samjeon Kindergarten. It was officially for the children of dual-income families within the group, but there was a special class. A class for heirs like me and children of the political and business elite. This class received special education. [Wait, does that mean I have to go to kindergarten?]"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

A반이라고 양 비서가 말했고, 부모님은 그 의미를 몰랐지만 나는 알고 있었다. A반은 바로 특별반을 의미했다. 내 모든 인맥은 사실 삼전 유치원부터 시작했다. 정재계의 자녀들은 자라서 다시 정재계를 움직였고, 나는 그들의 도움이 언제든 필요했다. 그렇다면 유치원에 집중해야 할 타이밍이다. 그리고 슬슬 연예계는 은퇴할 시기가 다가오기도 했다. 민국이는 어린이집에 가고, 나는 엄마를 따라 SKJ 기획 사무실에 갔다. SKJ 기획 사무실은 이제 가로수길에 위치했다. 엄마와 내가 들어서자 김미영 매니저가 시원한 물을 내밀었다. “많이 덥죠?” “언니, 저도 운전면허 따야 할 것 같아요. 애들 데리고 다니려면요. 성국이 유치원 다니면 배울까 봐요.” “삼전 유치원 정말 좋다고 친구들이 자랑하는 소리 많이 들었어요. 참, 성국이 이번에 또 광고랑 여러 가지 프로그램 제안이 들어왔는데요.” 김미영은 들어온 제안들을 정리해서 엄마에게 보였다. “방송국 프로그램, 이거 괜찮은 것 같아요. 성국이 유치원 가다! 이런 콘셉트인데, 또래 아이들과 지내는 자연스러운 모습을 찍는 건데, 어때요?” “사실은 안 그래도 요즘 고민이에요. 성국이 아빠랑 삼전 전자 전속 끝나면 더는 이 일 안 하기로 했거든요.” “스케줄에 무리 없으면 광고라도 하는 건 어때요?” [이제 내가 나서야 할 때인가.] 탁! 나는 테이블을 소리 나게 내려쳤다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” 엄마가 내 손을 잡으며 물었다. “엄마!” “왜?” “나… 일 시로.” 나는 최대한 또박또박 내 의사를 밝혔다. 모두 놀란 눈치였다. 여태 내가 일을 하기 싫다고 한 적은 없었기 때문이다. 물론 나는 기본적으로 워커홀릭에 잘난 척을 안 하면 살 수 없는 인간이기에, 아기 전성국으로 일한 게 즐거웠다. 하지만 이제 나도 어엿한 다섯 살이다. 1995년 당시 과거의 나는 한창 사춘기 시절을 겪던 중이었다. 당연히 사회 물정은 잘 몰랐다. 굵직한 일들이야 기억하고 있지만, 그것만으로는 이번 생에서 성공하기엔 부족하다. 삼전 그룹의 유치원 A반은 정재계의 자녀들이 골고루 다니는 곳이다. 이제 슬슬 인맥도 만들고, 다시 경제 공부도 시작해서, 좀 더 정확한 의사표시가 가능한 초등학교 입학 연령이자 IMF 시기가 오면 위기를 기회 삼아 도약할 계획이다. 나는 뿌듯한 얼굴로 어깨를 으쓱했다. [역시 난 전성국이야. 완벽한 계획이야.] 김미영 매니저는 테이블 위에 펼쳐놓은 제안서들을 차곡차곡 모았다. 그러곤 나를 빤히 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 일하기 싫어?” “네에! 성국이 유치원 갈 거야.” 엄마는 안쓰러운 얼굴로 나를 안았다. “성국이도 공부하고 싶구나.” [엄마, 공부가 아니라 인맥 만들러 가는 거야.] “성국이 엄마, 성국이 의견도 그렇고 우선은 이 제안들 다 거절할게요. 성국이가 다시 일하고 싶을 때 해도 되니까요.” “언니, 미안해요. 이렇게 성국이가 갑자기 일을 안 한다고 할 줄은 몰랐어요.” “미안하긴 뭐가 미안해요. 성국이 덕분에 고졸 출신 삼전 기획 경리부 직원이 SKJ 기획 대표 하고 있는데요. 임선미 씨도 예전만 못하지만, 고정적인 출연도 꾸준하고요. 이 기회에 우리도 신인 배우들 좀 더 키워보면 어떨까 해요.” “신인 발굴하시게요?” “성국이 일이 많았는데, 아무래도 줄면 시간이 될 것 같아요.” 내가 사람 보는 눈 하나는 확실했다. 김미영이 SKJ 기획의 대표이기는 하지만, 실질적인 소유자는 우리 가족과 김미영이었다. 김미영은 생각보다 포부가 큰 사람이었다. [앞으로도 잘 부탁해, 김미영.] 나는 김미영에게 다가가 등을 손으로 두 번 토닥거렸다. 엄마가 그 모습을 날카롭게 쳐다봤다. “언니, 봤죠?” “어, 진짜네.” [뭐가 진짜라는 거지?] “성국이가 언니 의견이 마음에 들었나 봐요.” “이 녀석 정말 천재 맞나 봐요. 우리 말 다 알아듣고.” 나는 얼른 손을 빼고는 뒷짐을 졌다. [이런, 들켰군.] 아무래도 앞으로 토닥 기술은 신중히 사용해야 할 것 같았다. * * * 단정한 네이비색 유치원 교복을 입은 내가 아파트 앞에서 삼전 유치원의 버스가 오기를 기다렸다. 결국, 이렇게 되고야 말았다. 나는 아빠와 엄마 손을 나란히 잡고 서 있었다. “하아-.” 나는 한숨을 내쉬었다. 엄마와 아빠는 한껏 들뜬 얼굴이었다. “미영 언니 친구도 삼전 그룹 다녀서 애들 삼전 유치원 보냈는데, 완전 만족했대. 다음에 학부모 참관일에 우리 꼭 가보자.” “와, 우리 성국이도 이제 제대로 된 유치원 다니네. 아빠가 더 설렌다. 아빠, 유치원도 못 나왔잖아.” [내가 갈 반은 아마 김 매니저가 친구 자식들이 다닌 반이 아니야. 거기는 일반적인 집안의 애들이나 다니는 반이라고.] 저 멀리 노란 삼전 유치원의 스쿨버스가 다가왔다. 버스가 멈춰 서자 젊은 남자 선생님이 나를 보고 알은척을 했다. “성국이 맞죠?” “와, 어떻게 이름도 아세요?” 아빠가 신기한 듯 물었다. “A반 학생들은 수가 많지 않아서 다 알아요. 성국아, 유치원 가자.” 남자 선생님은 아빠로부터 내 손을 건네받았다. 나는 살짝 슬픈 얼굴로 엄마와 아빠를 돌아보곤 유치원 버스에 올랐다. 남자 선생님은 나를 자리까지 안내해 안전벨트까지 채워줬다. “성국아, 30분만 더 가면 돼. 근데, 너 실제로 보니까 더 잘생겼다. 선생님도 완전 팬이었어. 친구들도 엄청 좋아할 거야.” “녜에. 감따합니다.” 나는 앉아서 배꼽 인사를 했다. 없는 집 애일수록 예의는 있어야 하니까. 곧 차가 출발했다. 창문 너머로 엄마, 아빠는 계속 손을 흔들었다. 나도 창문을 향해 손을 흔들었다. [어서 들어가, 엄마. 아빠. 나는 유치원 접수하러 갈게.] * * * “안녕하세요. 전. 성. 국. 입니다.” 나는 또박또박 한 자 한 자 천천히 내 이름을 말했다. 그리고 꾸벅 인사를 했다. 조르륵 앉은 다섯 명의 아이들이 나를 보고는 박수를 쳤다. 남자가 둘, 여자가 셋이었다. 여기에 내가 들어가면서 남자와 여자의 비율이 맞았다. A반 담당인 이지은 선생님은 아이들에게 나를 다시 소개해줬다. “여기 성국이는 너희들도 잘 알지?” 몇 명만 격하게 고개를 끄덕였다. 다른 반이라면 아마 환호가 터져 나왔을 것이다. 하지만 이 반의 아이들에게 연예인 따위 안중에도 없다. 이지은 선생님은 어색한 미소를 지으며 말을 얼른 끝냈다. “성국이가 중간에 전학 왔지만, 모두 같이 잘 지내요. 그럼, 30분 자유 시간 후에 영어 수업 시작할게요.” 아이들은 시큰둥하게 대답했다. 이 아이들은 원래 어릴 적부터 부리는 사람에게 굳이 친절하게 대할 필요 없다고 배웠다. 유치원 선생도 이들에게는 부리는 사람일 뿐이다. 이지은 선생님의 관찰 아래 30분의 여유 시간이 주어졌다. 한 손에 거대한 로봇을 든 남자아이가 일부러 어깨를 세게 부딪치고 지나갔다. [다섯 살 인생이란.] 남자아이들은 다섯 살부터 이미 서열 싸움을 시작했다. [전학 첫날부터 손봐줄까?] 아이의 명찰에는 ‘강주성’이라고 적혀 있었다. [강주성. 강주성. 누구 아들이지?] 번뜩 뉴스에서 봤던 검찰총장 강현웅의 얼굴이 스치고 지나갔다. 아마 손주쯤 되는 놈인가 보다. 강주성은 다시 내게 오더니 어깨를 부딪치려고 했기에 얼른 자리를 피했다. 삼전 그룹의 후계자일 때야 검찰총장이 아니라 대통령의 손자가 건드려도 무서울 게 없었지만, 나는 이 특별반에서 유일하게 사회 배려자일 뿐이었다. “성국아.” 쭉 찢어진 눈에 말간 얼굴을 한 여자아이가 다가왔다. 그 순간 명찰이 눈에 들어왔다. [전미진?] 전미진은 전태국의 여동생. 즉, 저번 생의 나의 여동생이기도 했다. 너무 어릴 적 얼굴이라 알아보지 못했다. 나는 잠시 얼얼한 얼굴로 전미진을 바라봤다. “성국아, 나는 미진이야.” “아, 안녕.” 나는 어색하게 인사를 했다. 전미진은 잘생긴 남자를 무척이나 좋아했다. 학창 시절에는 아이돌에 빠져 허우적거리더니, 커서는 직접 배우를 만나 사귀기도 여러 번이었다. 그러니까 내 말은, 전미진의 저 반짝이는 눈동자는 나를 아주 마음에 들어 하고 있다는 말이었다. “성국아, 너 우리 집에 와서 놀래?” “고마워. 다음에 갈게.” 나는 최대한 애매하게 대답했다. 지금 이 반에서 전미진의 심기를 건드려 좋을 건 없었다. 이때, 새초롬하게 생긴 여자애 한 명이 옆으로 끼어들었다. 이름은 이세희. “너희 아버지 뭐 하셔? 우리 아빠는 의사야.” [아하, 삼전 병원 병원장 손녀구나.] “우리 아빠는 식당 하셔.” 이세희가 해맑게 웃었다. “식당이 몇 개야? 우리 언니 친구는 치킨집 하는데 100개도 넘는대. 강촌치킨이라고 알아?” [그걸 지금 치킨집 한다고 하는 건가.] 강촌치킨이라면 전국에 많은 체인을 가지고 있는 치킨 재벌이었다. “우리 아빠는 하나!” 난 해맑게 웃었다. 그렇게 나는 30분 동안이 특별반의 구성을 확인했다. 검찰총장 손자, 강주성. 삼전 전자 대표의 손자, 김현중. 그리고 여자아이들 역시 쟁쟁한 집안의 아이들이었다. 삼전 병원 병원장의 손녀, 이세희. 전 국방부 장관의 손녀, 서여림. 그리고 삼전 전자 전재형 회장의 딸인 전미진이었다. 거기에 서민 중에 서민. 흙수저 중에 흙수저를 쥔 내가 끼어 있었다. 나에게 말 한 마디 걸지 않고 나를 관찰하던 서여림은 선생님에게 조르르 달려가서 뭐라고 이르는 것도 같았다. 할아버지도 이 정권, 저 정권 잘 옮겨 타더니 서여림에게도 집안사람들의 눈치가 그대로 유전된 모양이다. 선생님은 웃으며 서여림을 돌려보냈다. 서여림은 그 이후에도 나를 뚫어져라 관찰했다. [사방이 적이군.] 정말 인생은 유치원부터 살벌한 거였다. “자, 이제 영어 수업 시작할게요.” 이지은 선생님의 말에 아이들은 체형에 맞춰진 의자에 앉았다. 곧 문이 열리면서 원어민 선생님이 들어왔다. 원어민 선생님의 손에는 고급 케이크와 음료가 들려 있었다. 원어민 선생님도 명찰을 달고 있었는데, 이름은 토마스였다. 토마스는 곧 케이크를 잘라 아이들에게 나눠줬다. 그리고 모든 말은 영어로 진행됐다. 김현중이 케이크를 보더니 아는 척을 했다. “이거. 삼전 호텔서 머겄어.” [겨우 삼전 전자 대표 손자 주제에, 아는 척은. 나는 수도 없이 먹은 케이크야.] 하지만 이번 생에서는 처음이었다. 나는 삼전 호텔에서 가져온 딸기케이크를 포크로 떠서 입에 넣었다. 혀끝에 닿기도 전에 사르르 녹아사라지는 쉬폰 케이크. 나는 감동하며 케이크를 먹었다. 토마스가 나를 보더니 영어로 물었다. “성국, 맛있어?” “물론이죠!” 나는 무의식중에 영어로 대답했다. 아이들은 전혀 아무도 신경 쓰지 않았다. 이 아이들 대부분은 어릴 적부터 지금까지 미국 등 영어권 국가에서 살다 와서 영어가 한국말보다 편한 아이들도 있었다. 놀란 것은 이지은 선생님이었다. 하지만 곧 표정을 숨기곤 나를 지켜보는 게 느껴졌다. 분명 나에 대해서 보고를 받았을 것이다. 삼전 전자 CF와 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’로 국민 베이비로 등극했지만, 고아 출신의 부모. 거기다 유학은커녕 대한민국 서울 경계선을 넘어본 적도 없는 사실도 이미 파악했을 것이다. 다섯 살 이전에 내가 받은 교육이라고는 아무것도 없다시피 했다. [영어 정도는 커밍아웃할까. 뭐, TV 보고 배웠다고 하면 너무 천재 같은가….] 사실 삼전 그룹의 후계자 시절의 나는 피나는 노력으로 모든 것을 얻었지만, 밑바탕이 된 건 뛰어난 두뇌였다. [멘사 회원이기도 했으니까… 이 정도는 껌이지.] 나는 입꼬리를 슬쩍 올려 미소 짓고는 토마스의 대화에 적극적으로 참여하기로 마음먹었다. “성국은 어떤 케이크를 좋아해?” “케이크보다는 아빠의 보쌈이 좋아.” 이건 진심이었다. 내가 자연스럽게 영어로 토마스와 대화를 이어나가는 것을 본 전미진은 더 황홀한 눈치였다. 계속 옆에서 영어로 귀엽다거나 잘생겼다거나 그런 감탄사를 뱉어냈다. [정말, 저 모지리.] 나는 이를 꽉 깨물었다.","completion":"Episode 30 As soon as Secretary Yang got involved, my kindergarten admission process sped up significantly. I was already enrolled for the fall semester, and my class was decided. Secretary Yang told me it was Class A, and although my parents didn't understand what that meant, I did. Class A meant the special class. In fact, all my connections started from Samjeon Kindergarten. The children of the political and business elite grew up to move the political and business world themselves, and I always needed their help. Then, it was time to focus on kindergarten. And it was also about time to retire from the entertainment industry. Min-guk went to daycare, and I followed my mom to the SKJ Planning office. SKJ Planning was now located in Garosu-gil. As my mom and I entered, Manager Kim Mi-young offered us cool water. \\"It's really hot, isn't it?\\" \\"Sister, I think I need to get a driver's license too. To take the kids around. Maybe I'll learn when Seong-guk goes to kindergarten.\\" \\"I've heard a lot from my friends bragging about how great Samjeon Kindergarten is. Oh, and Seong-guk has received several offers for commercials and various programs again.\\" Kim Mi-young organized the offers and showed them to my mom. \\"This TV program looks good. It's a concept like 'Seong-guk goes to kindergarten!' It's about filming the natural interactions with peers. What do you think?\\" \\"Actually, I've been worried about this lately. We decided not to do this anymore once Seong-guk's exclusive contract with Samjeon Electronics ends.\\" \\"What about doing commercials if it doesn't interfere with the schedule?\\" [Is it time for me to step in?] Thump! I slammed the table loudly. \\"Seong-guk, why?\\" My mom asked, holding my hand. \\"Mom!\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"I... want to stop working.\\" I stated my opinion as clearly as possible. Everyone looked surprised. I had never said I didn't want to work before. Of course, I'm inherently a workaholic and can't live without showing off, so working as baby Seong-guk was enjoyable. But now, I'm a proud five-year-old. Back in 1995, I was going through my teenage years. Naturally, I didn't know much about the ways of the world. Remembering major events wasn't enough to succeed in this life. Class A of Samjeon Group's kindergarten was attended by children from various influential families. Now it was time to start making connections and studying economics again, to be able to express my opinions more accurately by the time I enter elementary school and to take advantage of the IMF crisis as an opportunity to leap forward. I proudly shrugged my shoulders. [After all, I'm Seong-guk. It's a perfect plan.] Manager Kim Mi-young neatly stacked the proposals on the table and looked at me intently. \\"Seong-guk, don't you want to work?\\" \\"Yes! Seong-guk will go to kindergarten.\\" My mom hugged me with a pitiful look. \\"Seong-guk wants to study too.\\" [Mom, it's not about studying. It's about making connections.] \\"Seong-guk's mom, considering Seong-guk's opinion, let's reject all these offers for now. We can always do them if Seong-guk wants to work again.\\" \\"Sister, I'm sorry. I didn't expect Seong-guk to suddenly not want to work.\\" \\"Don't be sorry. Thanks to Seong-guk, a high school graduate became the head of SKJ Planning from an accounting staff at Samjeon Planning. Im Sun-mi isn't as popular as before, but she still has steady appearances. Maybe it's time for us to focus more on nurturing new actors.\\" \\"Are you planning to scout new talents?\\" \\"Seong-guk had a lot of work, but now we might have more time.\\" I had a keen eye for people. Although Kim Mi-young was the representative of SKJ Planning, the real owners were our family and Kim Mi-young. Kim Mi-young had bigger ambitions than I thought. [Please take good care of me in the future, Kim Mi-young.] I approached Kim Mi-young and patted her back twice with my hand. My mom sharply observed this. \\"Sister, did you see?\\" \\"Yeah, really.\\" [What do they mean by 'really'?] \\"Seong-guk seems to like your opinion, sister.\\" \\"This kid really might be a genius. He understands everything we say.\\" I quickly withdrew my hand and put it behind my back. [Oops, I've been caught.] It seemed I had to be more careful with my patting technique in the future. * * * I, wearing a neat navy-colored kindergarten uniform, waited for the Samjeon Kindergarten bus in front of the apartment. Eventually, it had come to this. I stood there, holding hands with both my mom and dad. \\"Haah-.\\" I sighed. My mom and dad had excited faces. \\"Mi-young's friend also sent her kids to Samjeon Kindergarten and was completely satisfied. Let's definitely go to the parent observation day next time.\\" \\"Wow, our Seong-guk is now attending a proper kindergarten. Dad is more excited. Dad didn't even go to kindergarten.\\" [The class I'm going to isn't the one Manager Kim's friend's children attended. That's a class for children from ordinary families.] A yellow Samjeon Kindergarten school bus approached from afar. As the bus stopped, a young male teacher recognized me and nodded. \\"Are you Seong-guk?\\" \\"Wow, how do you know his name?\\" Dad asked, amazed. \\"There aren't many students in Class A, so I know everyone. Seong-guk, let's go to kindergarten.\\" The male teacher took my hand from my dad. I looked back at my mom and dad with a slightly sad face and boarded the kindergarten bus. The male teacher guided me to my seat and even fastened my seatbelt. \\"Seong-guk, it's just 30 more minutes. But, seeing you in person, you're even more handsome. I was a huge fan. Your friends will like you a lot too.\\" \\"Yes, thank you.\\" I bowed, sitting down. Even if you're from a poor family, you should have manners. Soon, the bus departed. Through the window, my mom and dad kept waving their hands. I also waved my hand towards the window. [Go inside, mom. Dad. I'm off to register for kindergarten.] * * * \\"Hello. I. Am. Seong. Guk.\\" I introduced my name slowly, one letter at a time, and bowed. The five seated children clapped for me. There were two boys and three girls. With me joining, the ratio of boys to girls was even. Class A's teacher, Ms. Lee Ji-eun, introduced me to the children again. \\"Do you all know Seong-guk here?\\" Only a few nodded vigorously. In any other class, there might have been cheers. But to these children, a celebrity was of no interest. Ms. Lee Ji-eun smiled awkwardly and quickly ended the introduction. \\"Seong-guk joined us mid-term, but let's all get along well. Now, we'll have 30 minutes of free time before we start our English lesson.\\" The children responded indifferently. These children were taught from a young age not to be overly kind to those who serve them. To them, even a kindergarten teacher was just another servant. Under Ms. Lee Ji-eun's supervision, we were given 30 minutes of free time. A boy with a giant robot in one hand deliberately bumped his shoulder against mine as he passed. [Such is the life of a five-year-old.] Boys start their hierarchy battles from the age of five. [Should I take care of this on my first day of transfer?] The boy's name tag read 'Kang Ju-seong.' [Kang Ju-seong. Kang Ju-seong. Whose son is he?] The face of Prosecutor General Kang Hyun-woong flashed through my mind. This must be his grandson or something. Kang Ju-seong approached me again, attempting to bump his shoulder into mine, but I quickly dodged. As the heir of Samjeon Group, I wouldn't have been afraid even if the grandson of the president touched me, but in this special class, I was the only one considered a beneficiary of social welfare. \\"Seong-guk.\\" A girl with long, slit eyes and a clean face approached me. At that moment, her name tag caught my eye. [Jeon Mi-jin?] Jeon Mi-jin was the younger sister of Jeon Tae-guk. In other words, she was my younger sister from my previous life. I didn't recognize her because she was too young. I looked at Jeon Mi-jin with a momentarily stunned face. \\"Seong-guk, I'm Mi-jin.\\" \\"Ah, hello.\\" I greeted her awkwardly. Jeon Mi-jin really liked handsome men. During her school days, she was obsessed with idols, and as she grew up, she dated actors several times. So, what I mean is, Jeon Mi-jin's sparkling eyes were very much into me. \\"Seong-guk, do you want to come play at my house?\\" \\"Thank you. I'll go next time.\\" I answered as vaguely as possible. It wouldn't be good to upset Jeon Mi-jin in this class. Then, a girl with a serene look joined us. Her name was Lee Se-hee. \\"What do your fathers do? My dad is a doctor.\\" [Ah, the granddaughter of Samjeon Hospital's director.] \\"My dad runs a restaurant.\\" Lee Se-hee smiled brightly. \\"How many restaurants? My sister's friend owns a chicken place with over 100 stores. Do you know Gangchon Chicken?\\" [Is she really calling that owning a chicken place?] Gangchon Chicken was a chicken empire with many chains nationwide. \\"My dad has one!\\" I smiled brightly. That's how I spent 30 minutes getting to know the composition of the special class. Grandson of the Prosecutor General, Kang Ju-seong. Grandson of Samjeon Electronics' CEO, Kim Hyun-jung. And the girls were from equally impressive families. Granddaughter of Samjeon Hospital's director, Lee Se-hee. Granddaughter of the former Minister of National Defense, Seo Ye-rim. And Jeon Mi-jin, the daughter of Samjeon Electronics' Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. Among them, I was the most ordinary of the ordinary. The only one holding the spoon of dirt among the spoons of dirt. Seo Ye-rim, who didn't speak to me but observed me, seemed to whisper something to the teacher. Her grandfather was good at switching sides between regimes, and it seemed Seo Ye-rim inherited her family's keen sense of observation. The teacher smiled and sent Seo Ye-rim back. After that, Seo Ye-rim continued to observe me intently. [I'm surrounded by enemies.] Life really was brutal from kindergarten. \\"Okay, let's start our English lesson now.\\" At Ms. Lee Ji-eun's words, the children sat in chairs tailored to their body shapes. Soon, the door opened, and a native English-speaking teacher entered. The teacher, named Thomas, brought in high-quality cakes and drinks. Thomas also wore a name tag, and his name was Thomas. Thomas soon cut the cake and distributed it to the children. All conversations were conducted in English. Kim Hyun-jung recognized the cake and showed off. \\"I've had this at Samjeon Hotel.\\" [Just a grandson of Samjeon Electronics' CEO, and he's showing off. I've eaten this cake countless times.] But in this life, it was my first time. I picked up a piece of strawberry cake from Samjeon Hotel with my fork and put it in my mouth. The chiffon cake melted before it even touched my tongue. I was moved as I ate the cake. Thomas looked at me and asked in English. \\"Seong-guk, is it delicious?\\" \\"Of course!\\" I unconsciously replied in English. None of the children paid any attention. Most of these children had lived in English-speaking countries like the United States since they were young, so English was more comfortable for them than Korean. Ms. Lee Ji-eun was surprised. But she quickly hid her expression and seemed to observe me. She must have received a report about me. Despite becoming a national baby through Samjeon Electronics CF and 'Five Men and a Baby Basket,' I was an orphan with no parents. Moreover, I had never been abroad, not even beyond the borders of Seoul, South Korea. Before the age of five, my education was almost non-existent. [Should I come out with my English skills? What if they think I'm too much of a genius if I say I learned it from watching TV...] In fact, as the heir of Samjeon Group, I achieved everything through blood, sweat, and tears, but my foundation was my brilliant mind. [I was also a member of Mensa... This is nothing.] I slightly lifted the corners of my mouth and smiled, deciding to actively participate in Thomas's conversation. \\"What kind of cake do you like, Seong-guk?\\" \\"I like my dad's bossam more than cake.\\" That was the truth.

[엄마, 아빠, 고생 많았어. 초등학교만 들어가봐. 내가 아주 이 집안, 바싹 더 잘살게 만들 테니까.] “성국아, 뭐가 그렇게 기분이 좋아?” 아빠가 머리를 쓰다듬었다. [하루하루 자란다는 게 좋아서 그래. 엄마, 아빠도 잘 자라는 것 같고 말이야.] “아아앙!” 방에서 잠에서 깬 민국이 녀석의 울음소리가 들렸다. 저 녀석만 없으면 정말 평화로운 아침인데…. 엄마는 민국이를 안아서 식탁으로 데리고 왔다. [엄마, 나 민국이랑 겸상 못 하겠어. 저 녀석 맨날 밥 다 흘려서 더럽다고.] 민국이는 그러거나 말거나 나를 보더니 달려들었다. “혀-영아.” “하아-.” 나는 한숨을 팍 쉬었다. 이 녀석은 세상에서 제일 먼저 배운 단어가 형이었다. [그래, 너도 이 집안의 실세가 누군지 본능적으로 알아보는 거지?] “엉!” 민국이는 내 옆에 앉더니, 히죽히죽 웃어댔다. [못생겼지만, 웃으면 그나마 낫긴 하네.] 나는 슬쩍 손을 들어 민국이의 엉덩이를 토닥였다. 또 뭐가 좋은지 웃는다. “참, 자기야. 성국이 유치원도 옮겨야 하잖아.” “유띠원. 시로!” 나는 강력하게 반대 의사를 표했다. 이사 오기 전에 잠시 다닌 유치원의 아이들과는 영 수준이 맞지 않았다. 글을 아는 애도 별로 없었고, 사회 경제 이슈에 대해서 토론할 상대도 하나도 없었다. 다들 장난감 들고 자랑하기 바쁠 뿐이었다. 아빠가 내 등을 도닥였다. “성국아, 친구를 사귀어야지. 아빠 일도 정리될 테니 가을 학기부터는 유치원 알아보자.” “미영 언니 친구가 추천해준 데는 대기도 잘 안 나네. 아무래도 다른 데 알아봐야 할 것 같아.” 나는 풀이 죽었다. 미래가 너무 암울해서였다. 유치원 지나 초등학교에, 중딩, 고딩까지. 도대체 얼마나 수준도 안 맞는 녀석들과 사회생활을 해야 하는지, 눈앞이 깜깜했다. “혀어엉. 머거.” 민국이가 내 입으로 지 숟가락을 푹 집어넣었다. [이 녀석이!] “혀어엉. 헤에.” [오늘만 봐준다. 너 때문에 봐주는 거 아니야. 엄마가 한 된장찌개가 맛있어서 봐주는 거야.] 나는 민국이가 밀어 넣은 밥을 꼭꼭 씹어 넘겼다. * * * 나는 촬영장의 퀴퀴한 냄새를 코로 훅 들이켰다. 물론 몸에는 분명 나쁜 냄새이다. 하지만 이 촬영장의 냄새도 당분간 안녕이다. 오늘이 삼전 전자 전속 모델로서 하는 마지막 촬영이기 때문이다. 그리고 나는 은퇴를 할 작정이다. 박수 칠 때 떠나라는 말처럼, 가장 화려할 때 떠나야 하는 게 인생이다. [이곳도 그리울까?] 시드머니를 벌기 위해 구르고 뛰어다닌 이곳이었다. 그리고 내가 목표로 한 금액은 이미 차고 넘쳤다. “성국아, 오늘 마지막 촬영이네.” 나와 같이 전속 모델이 끝나는 임선미가 웃으며 다가왔다. “누냐!” 나는 임선미를 향해 웃으며 손을 흔들었다. 우리 SKJ 기획의 든든한 물주인 임선미를 위해서라면 지금 당장 앞구르기도 할 수 있었다. 엄마와 김미영 매니저의 든든한 응원. 거기다 익숙한 임선미와의 촬영은 순조롭게 진행됐다. “자, 이제 마지막 컷입니다. 조금만 기운 내 주세요!” 사진작가의 외침이 들렸고, 임선미는 나를 안아 올렸다. “성국아, 진짜 마지막이다. 잘하자.” “화잇띵!” 난 귀엽게 파이팅을 외쳤다. 스태프들의 웃음소리가 여기저기에서 들렸고, 그렇게 내 마지막 삼전 전자 촬영이 끝이 났다. 엄마가 달려와 물을 내밀었다. 쪼오옥. 나는 빨대로 시원하게 물을 마셨다. “성국아, 고생했어.” [뭘, 이건 이제 껌이지.] 진짜 마지막이라고 생각하니 조금 아쉬운 생각이 들었다. 나는 촬영장을 한번 쑥 훑었다. 이때, 저 멀리서 익숙한 사람이 나타났다. [전재형 부회장 아니야?] 전재형 부회장은 감독과 스태프들에게 회식비와 금일봉을 지급하고, 나와 임선미에게 다가왔다. “오늘 식사 같이 하시죠.” 쪼오옥-. 나는 일부러 빨대로 물을 쭉 들이켰다. 전재형 부회장은 절대로 사람을 허투루 만나지 않았다. 임선미가 애매한 얼굴로 우리를 쳐다봤다. “전 오늘은 힘들 것 같아요. 선약이 있어서요.” [이거 뭐지?] 전재형 부회장의 여자관계까지 다 알지는 못하지만, 이 분위기면 임선미와 슬슬 헤어지는 단계인가. 양 비서가 엄마와 김미영에게 웃으며 다가왔다. “성국이가 삼전 호텔 짜장면을 그렇게 좋아한다고 들었습니다. 정리하시고 6시까지 거기서 뵙지요. 삼풍백화점 때 저희 모두가 성국이 때문에 산 거나 마찬가지라 부회장님께서 특별히 저녁 식사를 같이 하자고 하시네요.” 보상치고 삼전 호텔 짜장면은 진짜 약한데. 꼴깍. 주책없게 침은 이미 목을 타고 넘어갔다. 양 비서가 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 이따가 보자.” “녜에! 짜당면. 마니요.” 나는 혀 짧은 소리로 대답했다. * * * 엘리베이터 안에 단둘이 남게 된 전재형 부회장과 임선미 사이에는 어색한 기운이 흘렀다. 먼저 입을 연 건 임선미였다. “그동안 고마웠어.” “나두.” “후계자 준비 때문에 멀어진 거라고 생각하면 되는 거지?” “응.” 전재형 부회장은 삼청동 이 선생을 만나고 난 뒤 임선미에게 이별 통보를 했다. 곧 있으면 전주신 회장의 자리를 물려받는 상황이 온다. 제아무리 장남에 최대 주주라고 해도 잡음은 최대한 줄이는 것이 좋았다. “좋은 소식 있으면 언제든 연락할게.” “언제든 일하면서 어려울 땐 연락 줘. 그 정도는 해줄 수 있어. 나쁘게 끝난 것도 아니니까.” “알았어요. 삼전 그룹 회장님.” 임선미의 말과 동시에 엘리베이터가 지하 주차장에 멈춰 섰다. 기다리고 있던 양 비서를 따라 전재형 부회장이 먼저 이동하고, 임선미는 시간 차를 두고 매니저의 차량으로 향했다. * * * [왜 이렇게 안 나오지.] 나는 젓가락을 한 손에 쥐고 초조하게 삼전 호텔의 짜장면을 기다렸다. 스르륵. 미닫이문이 열리는 소리가 들렸다. 난 득달같이 문을 쳐다봤지만, 전재형 부회장과 양 비서가 걸어 들어왔다. 대실망. 내가 실망한 내색을 하자 양 비서가 푸근하게 웃었다. “성국아, 짜장면 곧 올 거야.” “와아!” 나는 저절로 어깨를 들썩였다. 특기로 익힌 건데, 요즘은 기분 좋을 때마다 습관처럼 어깨를 들썩이게 됐다. 양 비서의 말대로 짜장면은 곧 나왔고, 전재형 부회장은 나와 엄마, 김미영 매니저에게 그동안 삼전 전자의 모델을 한 수고를 치하하고 감사의 의미로 금일봉도 내밀었다. 전재형 부회장은 아버지일 때도 참 지루하게 말을 돌려서 했는데, 오늘도 그랬다. 그러는 통에 엄마와 김미영 매니저는 산해진미를 앞에 두고도 물만 홀짝였다. 그러거나 말거나 나는 짜장면을 호로록 마시듯 먹었다. 아이가 되고 나니 어느 자리에서 격식을 차리지 않아도 돼서 편한 것도 있었다. “성국아, 아저씨 목숨 구해줘서 고마워.” [겨우 짜장면으로 퉁치려고? 전재형 부회장, 재벌이 왜 이렇게 쩨쩨하지? 금일봉 얼마야? 한 1억 들었나?] 전재형 부회장은 냅킨을 들어 짜장면이 가득 묻은 내 입을 닦아줬다. “천천히 먹어.” [아버지일 때도 이런 적 없잖아. 당황스럽게 왜 이래?] “사실은 말이죠. 오늘 이 자리를 마련한 것은요.” 전재형 부회장이 엄마를 쳐다봤다. 나도 전재형 부회장을 주목했다. “성국이가 제 목숨도 구해주지 않았습니까. 이제 삼전 전자 모델 일은 끝났지만, 성국이 이제 겨우 다섯 살이잖아요. 제가 성국이의 후견인이 되었으면 해서요.” “그게 무슨….” 엄마는 당황한 나머지 말을 잇지 못했다. 양 비서가 나섰다. “성국이가 앞으로 공부하고 싶을 때까지 저희가 모두 후원해 드리고 싶습니다. 대학 공부부터, 유학을 가고 싶으면 유학을 가도 되고요. 후에 삼전 그룹에 입사할 때 어느 자리이든 특별 채용도 생각하고 있습니다.” 전재형 부회장이 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. 아버지로 살 때도 이런 적이 없는 양반이, 오늘따라 나를 아들처럼 대했다. “성국이 덕분에 제가 산 거나 마찬가지라고 생각합니다. 여러 가지 고심하다가 드리는 제안이니, 거절하지 않으셨으면 좋겠습니다.” [뭐야, 목숨 값으로 동탄의 삼전 전자 부지 정도는 좀 떼줘야 하는 거 아니야?]","completion":"Episode 28 Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was perplexed. Of course, it wasn't the first time a woman had passed him by, but there had never been such an incident with Seong-guk's family. This teacher quickly noticed Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's unease and subtly changed the topic. \\"What I mean is… that's the extent of our connection.\\" \\"Are you saying it's a connection as significant as that between a father and son?\\" \\"Surely, in a past or future life, we were destined to meet as father and son at least once. Even if not in this life.\\" \\"Then what about our connection in this life?\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung cautiously asked. \\"Hmm… You'll help out bit by bit and then take everything all at once.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"Isn't that what children are like? Little by little when raising them. Then, when I grow old and sick, they take everything I have. Especially if the parents have a lot, there's much to give to their children. Although we weren't born into a father-son relationship in this life, you should be cautious. Looking at this child's fortune, although he's young and can't show his full potential yet, once he encounters water, he will head to the sea and command the world.\\" The elder quietly reviewed the fortune again. \\"Though born to poor parents with nowhere to rely on, this child will greatly uplift this household.\\" \\"How do you see my son, Taeguk?\\" \\"Your son's fortune…\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was well aware of his son, Jeon Taeguk's fortune. Despite being born through a cesarean section scheduled down to the date and time, something went wrong, and his fortune after birth wasn't as favorable. \\"Hmm… If he had an older brother, his life would have been suppressed, unable to fully stretch his wings, but fortunately, without an older brother, that won't happen. However, you must watch over him until the end.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's head was filled with complex thoughts. The teacher quietly looked at Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's face. \\"Vice Chairman, let me give you a piece of advice. The future isn't set in stone. Keep this child close and watch over him. There's a saying to keep your enemies closer.\\" \\"I'll keep that in mind.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung moistened his dry throat with chrysanthemum tea. \\"By the way, this child saved my life at Sampoong Department Store. And he also asked to extend the search for just five more days.\\" \\"Hmm… Looking at his fortune, he's no ordinary child. Please listen. Let's see how far his energy goes.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung nodded. The teacher took a sip of chrysanthemum tea and looked at Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung with a hint of anticipation. \\"It seems there will be good news soon, Vice Chairman.\\" \\"…Thank you.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung didn't ask any questions. Because the time had come. His heavy heart felt a bit lighter. When the teacher made such a declaration, it invariably came true. \\"Good things come with bad, so prepare your heart.\\" Could it be… Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung didn't voice the ominous thought that suddenly crossed his mind. Exactly five days after Seong-guk asked for more time, a survivor was found on the 17th day, buried on the first basement floor. Thanks to Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's promise of support, the search was extended, contrary to opinions to conclude the rescue efforts earlier. The discovery of a survivor after 17 days was celebrated by the public, and news naturally followed that the Samjeon Group had sponsored the effort. This incident led to a surge in popularity for Samjeon Electronics, hitting record sales. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung couldn't ignore his connection with Seong-guk. * * * The alarm sounded loudly. Dad jumped out of bed, quickly turned off the alarm, and the sound of him washing up followed. I rubbed my eyes and got up. Today was Dad's last day of work. The smell of boiling soybean paste stew filled the house. I hurried to the dining table and sat in my chair. \\"Seong-guk, you're up already?\\" \\"Mom! I'm hungry.\\" \\"You have a shoot today, you should've slept more.\\" I shook my head. Today was the day to shoot the Samjeon Electronics catalog that we couldn't do because of the Sampoong Department Store collapse. \\"Seong-guk, let's eat when Dad comes out.\\" \\"Okay!\\" Mom peeled a banana and put it in my mouth, then went back to preparing the food. Dad, after washing up, kissed my cheek and helped Mom finish preparing breakfast. I watched them intently. Mom and Dad, now in their mid-20s. Though orphans, they lived diligently, and thanks to a son like me, we even moved to an apartment in Jamsil. Dad's bossam restaurant was also about to open, and Mom and Manager Kim Mi-young's SKJ Planning were planning to move to Gangnam. I heard Manager Kim Mi-young was also moving here from her one-room in Suyuri. I chewed the banana happily. [Mom, Dad, you've worked hard. Just wait until I enter elementary school. I'll make sure our family lives even better.] \\"Seong-guk, what's making you so happy?\\" Dad ruffled my hair. [It's nice to grow up day by day. It seems like Mom and Dad are growing up well too.] \\"Ah!\\" Min-guk's crying voice came from the room. If only it weren't for that guy, it would've been a peaceful morning. Mom brought Min-guk to the dining table. [Mom, I can't eat with Min-guk. He always spills his food and makes a mess.] Min-guk, regardless, rushed towards me. \\"Hyung.\\" \\"Sigh.\\" I sighed deeply. The first word this guy learned in the world was \\"hyung.\\" [Right, you instinctively recognize who the real power in this house is, huh?] \\"Yeah!\\" Min-guk sat next to me and grinned. [He may not be good-looking, but at least he looks better when he smiles.] I gently patted Min-guk's bottom with my hand. He laughed again for some reason. \\"By the way, honey. We need to transfer Seong-guk's kindergarten.\\" \\"Kindergarten. No!\\" I strongly expressed my opposition. The kids at the kindergarten I briefly attended before moving here were not on my level. There were hardly any kids who knew how to read, and there was no one to discuss social and economic issues with. They were all busy showing off their toys. Dad patted my back. \\"Seong-guk, you need to make friends. Dad's work will be settled, so let's look for a kindergarten for the fall semester.\\" \\"The place recommended by Mi-young's friend doesn't seem to have a long waitlist. We might need to look elsewhere.\\" I felt deflated. The future seemed too bleak. From kindergarten to elementary, middle, and high school, how long do I have to socialize with people who don't match my level? It was all so dark. \\"Hyung. Eat.\\" Min-guk shoved his spoon into my mouth. [This guy!] \\"Hyung. Hehe.\\" [Just for today. It's not because of you. It's because Mom's soybean paste stew is delicious.] I chewed and swallowed the rice Min-guk pushed into my mouth. * * * I inhaled the musty smell of the shooting studio. Of course, it's a bad smell for the body. But this smell of the shooting studio is also saying goodbye for a while. Today is my last shoot as an exclusive model for Samjeon Electronics. And I plan to retire. Leave when the applause is loudest, they say. It's best to leave life at its peak. [Will I miss this place?] This was the place where I rolled and ran around to gather seed money. And the amount I aimed for has already been far exceeded. \\"Seong-guk, it's our last shoot today.\\" Lim Seon-mi, who is also ending her exclusive modeling contract, approached with a smile. \\"Sister!\\" I waved at Lim Seon-mi with a smile. For Lim Seon-mi, the solid financial supporter of our SKJ Planning, I could even do a somersault right now. The strong support of Mom and Manager Kim Mi-young. And the familiar shooting with Lim Seon-mi went smoothly. \\"Okay, this is the last cut. Please give it your all!\\" The photographer's shout was heard, and Lim Seon-mi lifted me up. \\"Seong-guk, it's really the last one. Let's do well.\\" \\"Fighting!\\" I cutely shouted fighting. Laughter erupted from the staff, and that's how my last shoot with Samjeon Electronics ended. Mom rushed over and handed me water. Slurp. I drank the water through the straw refreshingly. \\"Seong-guk, you worked hard.\\" [What, this is now a piece of cake.] Thinking it was really the last time made me feel a bit sad. I scanned the shooting studio. Then, a familiar figure appeared in the distance. [Isn't that Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung?] Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, after handing out dinner money and bonuses to the director and staff, approached me and Lim Seon-mi. \\"Let's have dinner together today.\\" Slurp-. I deliberately sucked water through the straw. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung never met people carelessly. Lim Seon-mi looked at us with an ambiguous expression. \\"I think I'll be tired today. I have a prior engagement.\\" [What's this?] I didn't know everything about Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's relationships with women, but if this was the atmosphere, were Lim Seon-mi and he about to break up? Secretary Yang approached Mom and Manager Kim Mi-young with a smile. \\"Seong-guk loves the Samjeon Hotel's jjajangmyun. Let's meet there at 6 o'clock after you wrap up. Because of Seong-guk, we all practically owe him our lives during the Sampoong Department Store incident, so the Vice Chairman wants to have dinner together specially.\\" Samjeon Hotel's jjajangmyun as compensation is really weak. Gulp. I couldn't help but swallow my saliva. Secretary Yang patted my head. \\"Seong-guk, see you later.\\" \\"Okay! Lots of jjajangmyun.\\" I responded with a lisp. * * * An awkward atmosphere flowed between Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung and Lim Seon-mi, left alone in the elevator. Lim Seon-mi was the first to speak. \\"Thanks for everything.\\" \\"Me too.\\" \\"Should I take it that we've grown apart because of the successor preparations?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung had notified Lim Seon-mi of their breakup after meeting Teacher Lee in Samcheong-dong. Soon, he would inherit the position of Chairman Jeon Joo-shin. Even as the eldest son and the largest shareholder, it was best to minimize any noise. \\"Let me know if there's good news.\\" \\"Whenever you're having a hard time at work, call me. I can at least do that much. We didn't end on bad terms.\\" \\"Got it. Chairman of Samjeon Group.\\" As Lim Seon-mi spoke, the elevator stopped at the underground parking lot. Following Secretary Yang, Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung moved first, and Lim Seon-mi headed to her manager's car after a time gap. * * * [Why aren't they coming out?] I held chopsticks in one hand and anxiously waited for the Samjeon Hotel's jjajangmyun. Swoosh. The sliding door opened. I eagerly looked at the door, but Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung and Secretary Yang walked in. Big disappointment. Seeing my disappointed look, Secretary Yang smiled warmly. \\"Seong-guk, the jjajangmyun will be out soon.\\" \\"Wow!\\" I involuntarily shrugged my shoulders. It's a skill I've honed, but lately, I've been shrugging my shoulders like a habit whenever I'm happy. As Secretary Yang said, the jjajangmyun soon arrived, and Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung expressed his gratitude and appreciation to me, Mom, and Manager Kim Mi-young for our work as models for Samjeon Electronics, even handing out bonuses. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung always spoke in a roundabout way, even when he was my father, and he did the same today. Because of that, Mom and Manager Kim Mi-young barely touched the feast in front of them, just sipping water. But I slurped up the jjajangmyun without caring for formality. Being a child again meant I didn't have to keep up appearances in any setting, which was convenient. \\"Seong-guk, thank you for saving my life.\\" [Just jjajangmyun for saving your life? Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, why are chaebols so stingy? How much is in the bonus? About 1 billion?] Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung wiped my mouth, full of jjajangmyun, with a napkin. \\"Eat slowly.\\" [You never did this when you were my father. Why are you acting like this now? It's embarrassing.] \\"Actually, the reason I arranged this meeting today is...\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung looked at Mom. I also focused on Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. \\"Seong-guk saved my life. Although the model work for Samjeon Electronics has ended, Seong-guk is only five years old. I would like to become Seong-guk's guardian.\\" \\"What do you mean...\\" Mom was so flustered she couldn't continue. Secretary Yang stepped in. \\"We would like to sponsor everything Seong-guk wishes to study until he wants to, including college and studying abroad if he wishes. We are also considering special recruitment for any position if he wishes to join Samjeon Group later.\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung patted my head. I felt like he was treating me like a son, something he never did when he was my father. \\"I believe I owe my life to Seong-guk. After much consideration, this is my offer, and I hope you won't refuse.\\" [What, shouldn't you at least give me the Samjeon Electronics site in Dongtan as compensation for my life?]"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This condition can present opportunities for some traders, such as the potential for significant price movements from relatively small trades. However, it also comes with increased risks, including the possibility of not being able to easily exit positions. If you're looking to identify illiquid markets, while there may not be websites dedicated exclusively to highlighting them, you can use several tools and techniques within existing platforms to find these markets: 1. **Exchange Websites and Trading Platforms**: - Most cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken provide trading volume data for all listed pairs. By filtering or sorting markets by trading volume, users can identify those with the least activity, which may suggest illiquidity. 2. **CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko**: - These platforms provide comprehensive data on cryptocurrencies, including trading volume, market cap, and available trading pairs across multiple exchanges. By examining lower-volume trading pairs or those on smaller exchanges, you can spot potentially illiquid markets. 3. **TradingView**: - TradingView offers detailed charts and data for a wide range of cryptocurrencies and trading pairs. It can be used to analyze trading volumes over time and identify patterns that suggest illiquidity, such as large gaps in the order book or significant price changes from small trades. 4. **Cryptowatch**: - Cryptowatch provides real-time cryptocurrency market data, including order books, trading volumes, and price charts for numerous exchanges. By studying the depth of the market and trading activity, you can assess the liquidity of various trading pairs. 5. **APIs from Exchanges**: - For those comfortable with programming, using APIs provided by cryptocurrency exchanges can allow for the custom analysis of trading data. By fetching order book, volume, and recent trade data, you can programmatically assess the liquidity of markets across multiple platforms. When looking for illiquid markets, it's essential to exercise caution. Illiquid markets are more easily manipulated, and entering or exiting positions can be difficult without significantly affecting the price. Always perform thorough research and consider the risks before trading in these environments."},{"prompt":"there is a better trading setup than the follwing one? if yes please provide. the Example is: -25% SL with 4 TP targets. -25%; 100% 100%; 50% (i.e. takes out your initials) 250%; 20% 400%; 20% 1000%; 10%","completion":"Your specified trading setup seems to be tailored for high risk and high reward scenarios, specifically in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. This setup involves having a 25% stop-loss (SL) with four take-profit (TP) targets (100%, 250%, 400%, 1000%) and distributing the risk across these targets in a descending percentage of your position (50%, 20%, 20%, 10% respectively). It's a strategy that aims to maximize gains while maintaining a significant risk control mechanism via the stop loss. Whether there's a \\"better\\" trading setup depends greatly on your trading goals, risk tolerance, trading style (day trading, swing trading, position trading, etc.), and the market conditions. No one-size-fits-all strategy can be considered the best for every trader and situation. However, I can provide an alternative setup that still focuses on high reward but might offer a more balanced approach to risk management: # Modified Approach with Incremental SL Adjustment and TP Targets **Initial Setup**: - **Initial Stop Loss**: -15% (Tighter than your original to reduce potential downside) - **Initial Position Size**: Calibrate according to your maximum tolerable loss. Always know the maximum you're willing to lose on a single trade. **Take-Profit and Stop-Loss Adjustment Strategy**: 1. **First Target (50%)**: When the price reaches a +50% gain, sell 25% of the position and move the stop loss to your entry point (breakeven). 2. **Second Target (100%)**: Sell another 25% of your position and move the stop loss to +50% of the entry price, ensuring a guaranteed profit even if the market turns. 3. **Third Target (250%)**: Sell 20% of your remaining position and adjust the stop loss to +100% of the entry price, locking in substantial profit. 4. **Fourth Target (400%)**: Sell another 20% of your position and move the stop loss to +250% of the entry price. 5. **Final Target (1000%)**: Sell the remaining 10% of your position. **Key Benefits**: - **Incremental Profit Booking**: Ensures you capitalize on different stages of a favorable market movement without waiting solely for a high target. - **Adjusted Stop Loss**: Protects gains by moving up the stop loss, potentially transforming a high-risk setup into a no-loss scenario after the first target is hit. **Flexibility**: - **Adjust According to Market Sentiment and Performance**: Depending on how bullish or bearish you perceive the market, you can adjust the above percentages and targets. - **Personal Risk Tolerance**: Modify the setup based on how aggressively or conservatively you wish to trade, tweaking both TP levels and the percentage of the position you sell at each target. Remember, the success of any trading setup heavily relies on disciplined execution, continuous learning, and adaptation to market changes. Always be prepared for the possibility of loss, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

However, it's vital to understand the increased risk that comes with not adjusting your stop loss as the price moves in your favor, which usually serves to protect gains. Here's an alternative strategy that relies on a fixed stop loss and diversified take-profit targets. This approach focuses on capitalizing on positive market moves without the specific stop-loss adjustment, while still attempting to manage downside risk. # Alternative Trading Setup: **Stop Loss and Position Size**: - **Stop Loss (SL)**: -20% instead of -25%, a tighter stop loss may help reduce potential losses per trade. - **Position Size**: Determine based on the maximum amount you're willing to lose on this trade, given the 20% SL. **Take-Profit (TP) Targets**: 1. **First Target (+50%)**: Sell 20% of your position. This target aims for a more conservative initial gain, taking some profit earlier in the price movement. 2. **Second Target (+100%)**: Sell 30% of your position. By this target, you're securing a substantial portion of your initial investment and gains. 3. **Third Target (+250%)**: Sell 25% of your position. Here, you're targeting a higher gain while still keeping a significant portion of your trade active. 4. **Fourth Target (+500%)**: Sell 15% of your position. Adjusting this target to a more realistic profit-taking point if the asset experiences significant bullish momentum. 5. **Final Target (+750%)**: Sell the remaining 10% of your position. This final target aims for an optimistic outcome, leaving a portion of your position to benefit from potential extensive rallies. **Key Strategy Notes**: - **Diversified TP Levels**: This setup provides more gradual profit booking, helping to realize gains throughout different stages of a favorable market movement. - **Fixed SL**: Keeping a non-adjustable SL can be risky; ensure you are comfortable with the potential for a 20% loss from your entry point. The idea is to manage overall exposure across multiple trades rather than maximizing protection on a single trade. - **Position Distribution**: By taking profits at various targets, you're attempting to capture gains while still leaving room for significant upside. **Risk Management Considerations**: - Ensure that the sum of your potential losses from multiple trades does not exceed your overall risk tolerance. Consistency in maintaining the stop loss and disciplined taking of profits are critical. - Continuously monitor market conditions. External factors or news can rapidly change the market sentiment, potentially invalidating your trade setup. - Consider the liquidity of the asset. High TP targets require a market capable of absorbing sell orders without significant price impact. Remember, all trading involves risk, and there's no one-size-fits-all strategy. It's essential to adapt and refine your strategy based on your trading style, risk tolerance, and the market's behavior. Testing your strategy with smaller positions or through simulation can help you gauge its effectiveness before fully committing."},{"prompt":"can you please optimize this trading setup: -25% SL with 4 TP targets. -25%; 100% 100%; 50% (i.e. takes out your initials) 250%; 20% 400%; 20% 1000%; 10%","completion":"Optimizing a trading setup with a -25% stop loss and multiple take-profit (TP) targets requires balancing risk management with the potential for significant returns. The original setup aims for high rewards but also encompasses substantial risk, especially with a -25% stop loss. Let's adjust this setup to enhance risk-reward efficiency while aiming to capture substantial profits. # Optimized Trading Setup: 1. **Stop Loss (SL):** -25%. This remains unchanged as it defines the risk appetite and sets the stage for calculating the position size based on the maximum amount one is willing to lose. 2. **Position Size Calculation:** - Adjust your position size to ensure that a -25% move does not risk more than 1-2% of your total trading capital. This conservative approach to position sizing helps manage the overall portfolio risk. 3. **Take-Profit (TP) Targets Adjustment:** - **TP1: 75% profit; Sell 30% of the position.** By lowering the first TP target and increasing the percentage sold, you're aiming to secure profits earlier and decrease your exposure more quickly. This adjustment can help in volatile markets where reaching 100% gains is not guaranteed. - **TP2: 150% profit; Sell 30% of the position.** This second target takes out a larger portion of your position at a higher profit margin, ensuring that you lock in significant gains while still letting the rest of the position run for higher targets. - **TP3: 300% profit; Sell 20% of the position.** By adjusting this target upwards slightly, you aim for a higher return on the remaining position while still securing a sizable portion of the gains. - **TP4: 500% profit; Sell 20% of the position.** This final target is set for an exceptional gain scenario. By selling 20% here, you allow for a considerable part of your position to benefit from substantial market moves without risking too much on highly ambitious targets. # Risk Management Enhancements: - **Review SL Mechanism:** Consider using a trailing stop loss after reaching the first TP. While the original requirement was not to move the SL to the entry point, implementing a trailing stop after substantial gains can protect from sudden market reversals without limiting potential upside. - **Regularly Reassess the Market Conditions:** Your TP levels and SL should not be set in stone. If significant news or market sentiment shifts occur, be ready to adjust your targets accordingly. - **Profit Reinvestment Strategy:** After successful trades, consider re-investing a portion of the profits into new positions while keeping the risk management rules consistent. This approach can help compound gains. # Position Review and Adjustment: - **Continuous Monitoring:** Use technical and fundamental analysis to review your open positions regularly. If a trend seems to be weakening or reversing before hitting the next TP, consider taking profits early or adjusting the TP levels. - **Mental and Conditional Stop Loss:** Beyond a fixed SL, have a mental or conditional SL based on changing market conditions or unexpected news affecting the market sentiment. # Note: Every trader's risk tolerance, capital size, and trading strategy can significantly impact how a trading setup is optimized. The above optimization aims to balance the risk and reward more effectively while allowing for flexibility based on market conditions and individual trader preferences. It's crucial to backtest any trading strategy and adjust based on performance and changing market dynamics."},{"prompt":"can you please optimize this trading setup for extreme volatile markets: -25% SL with 4 TP targets. -25%; 100% 100%; 50% (i.e. takes out your initials) 250%; 20% 400%; 20% 1000%; 10%","completion":"Trading in extremely volatile markets requires a careful balance between seizing profit-making opportunities and managing risk. The original setup has clear goals but might benefit from adjustments to better suit the rapid price changes common in such environments. Here is an optimized version designed to capitalize on volatility while aiming to protect from its downside. # Optimized Trading Setup for Extreme Volatility: 1. **Stop Loss (SL):** - Rethink the -25% SL. In a highly volatile market, a -25% move can happen quickly and might not necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal. Consider tightening this to -15% or -20%. A tighter SL can help preserve capital during sudden drops. 2. **Position Sizing:** - It’s even more critical in volatile markets to only risk an amount you are comfortable losing. Since the SL is tighter, you may adjust your position size accordingly, but still ensure it aligns with your overall risk management strategy. 3. **Take-Profit (TP) Targets Adjustment:** - **TP1: +50% profit; Sell 40% of the position.** In volatile markets, securing profits earlier can be advantageous. Increasing the portion sold at the first TP helps lock in gains before potential reversals. - **TP2: +100% profit; Sell 30% of the position.** This continues to secure a significant chunk of the profit while still keeping skin in the game for higher rewards. - **TP3: +200% profit; Sell 20% of the position.** By adjusting this TP, you're adapting to the volatile environment where reaching +250% might become increasingly rare. - **TP4: +300% profit; Sell 10% of the position.** This final target is adjusted downward to be more achievable in a volatile market while ensuring a portion of your investment benefits from outlier moves. # Additional Optimization Strategies: - **Trailing Stop Loss:** Consider using a trailing stop loss after hitting the first TP. This approach allows you to protect gains as the price moves in your favor, which is particularly useful in volatile markets where reversals can be swift. - **Dynamic TP and SL Adjustments:** In volatile markets, being flexible with your TP and SL points based on real-time market analysis and news can be beneficial. If new information or market sentiment suggests a potential reversal, don’t hesitate to adjust your targets accordingly. - **Frequent Monitoring:** Volatile markets require constant vigilance. Regularly assess open positions, and be prepared to make quick decisions to protect your capital or take profits. - **Scale-Out Strategy:** Given the increased portion being sold at earlier TPs, consider scaling out of positions even beyond the predefined TPs if the momentum continues to be exceptionally strong. - **Mental Resilience:** Volatile markets can test emotional discipline. Stick to your predefined strategy as much as possible, avoiding rash decisions based on fear or greed. # Final Note: Optimizing for extreme volatility is about being nimble, securing profits early, and protecting your capital from sudden market moves. However, it’s essential to acknowledge that even the best-planned strategies can face challenging market conditions. Always be prepared for the possibility of loss and manage your investments according to your overall risk tolerance. Testing your strategy with smaller amounts or on paper before fully committing can also provide valuable insights and adjustments."},{"prompt":"can you please optimize this trading setup instead of 4 tp i want 3: -25% SL with 4 TP targets. -25%; 100% 100%; 50% (i.e. takes out your initials) 250%; 20% 400%; 20% 1000%; 10%","completion":"Adjusting the trading setup to use three take-profit (TP) targets instead of four, while keeping the initial -25% stop loss (SL), involves consolidating the profit-taking strategy to ensure we're still capturing significant potential gains across different market phases. Let's redesign the strategy to optimize for profitability and risk management with these new parameters: # Optimized Trading Setup with 3 TP Targets: 1. **Stop Loss (SL):** - Keep the -25% SL as the fundamental risk management boundary. This level allows for market volatility while aiming to protect against significant adverse movements. 2. **Position Sizing:** - Given the -25% SL, position size should be determined with the understanding that any single trade should not risk more than a predetermined percentage of your trading portfolio (often 1-2% of total capital). 3. **Take-Profit (TP) Targets Adjustment:** - **TP1: +75% profit; Sell 40% of the position.** By consolidating the four TPs into three, the first target is set to capture substantial gains while balancing the risk of reversals in volatile market phases. Taking out 40% helps in securing a notable portion of the investment earlier. - **TP2: +200% profit; Sell 30% of the position.** This target is adjusted to optimize the balance between achievable returns and exposure to market volatility, securing further profits while still maintaining a position for higher gains. - **TP3: +400% profit; Sell the remaining 30% of the position.** Setting the final target at +400% aims for an ambitious yet possible return in volatile or trending markets. Selling the remainder of the position here locks in all gains from the trade. # Additional Strategy Enhancements: - **Dynamic SL Adjustments:** Although the initial requirement suggests not moving the SL to the entry point, consider implementing dynamic SL adjustments after reaching TP1. This could mean either manually raising the SL to break even or utilizing a trailing stop for the remaining position to protect from significant downturns and lock in profits. - **Regular Market Assessment:** Given the large intervals between the TPs, it's crucial to stay informed about market trends and sentiment that could affect the outcome of your trade. Be prepared to make informed adjustments to TPs and SL based on new information. - **Patience and Discipline:** This optimized setup requires patience, allowing your trades to reach their full potential. Discipline in adhering to SL and TP levels is crucial to safeguard profits and manage risks. # Risk Considerations: - **Adjust for Personal Risk Tolerance:** The aggressive nature of the TP targets necessitates a clear understanding and acceptance of the inherent risk. Adjust the strategy to align with your risk tolerance and trading goals. - **Portfolio Management:** Always consider how each trade fits within your broader trading and investment strategy. Ensure that the aggregate risk of concurrent trades does not expose you to undue portfolio-wide risk. Adapting a trading strategy to include fewer TP targets with a fixed SL requires maintaining a balance between ambition for high returns and the pragmatism of risk management. This setup aims to capture significant market movements while securing profits at strategic intervals, tailored for traders comfortable with a moderate to high risk-reward profile."},{"prompt":"make a trading setup for the following market: newly listed memecoins in a decentralized exchange i need stop loss and take profit high risk high reward","completion":"Trading newly listed memecoins on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) embodies the epitome of high risk, high reward scenarios in the crypto market. These assets can be incredibly volatile, often subject to large pumps and dumps, making a strategic trading setup crucial. Below is a bespoke trading setup tailored to these conditions, emphasizing both aggressive profit-taking and stringent risk management. # Trading Setup for Newly Listed Memecoins on DEXs Pre-Trade Research: 1. **Initial Research:** Prioritize memecoins with solid backing, potentially interesting utilities, or strong community support observed through social media engagement. 2. **Liquidity Check:** Assess the liquidity pools for your target memecoin to ensure there's enough volume for entry and exit without significantly impacting the price. Position Sizing: - **Capital Allocation:** Given the high risk, allocate only a small percentage of your trading capital to any single memecoin position (e.g., 1-2%). This helps mitigate the risk of a total loss. Entry Strategy: - **Buy-in Phases:** Consider a phased entry approach to average your buy-in price, dividing your allocated capital for the coin into two or three portions. Stop Loss (SL): - **SL Setting:** Set a tight SL at -20% from your average entry price. The volatility of memecoins can trigger SLs frequently; however, the fast recuperation often observed in these assets justifies the tight threshold. Take-Profit (TP) Targets: 1. **TP1: +50% profit; Sell 30% of the position.** Given the unpredictable nature of memecoins, securing profits early is crucial. 2. **TP2: +100% profit; Sell 30% of the position.** This realizes significant gains while still leaving room for exceptional returns. 3. **TP3: +200% profit; Sell 40% of the position.** The final target aims for a home-run exit, realizing the high-reward aspect of the setup. # Additional Considerations: - **Monitoring:** Newly listed memecoins require constant monitoring due to their volatile nature. Be prepared to act fast. - **Emotional Discipline:** Be disciplined with SL and TP orders. The temptation to hold for larger gains needs to be balanced against the risk of sudden price reversals. - **Smart Contract Risks:** Be aware of potential risks like rug pulls or smart contract vulnerabilities. Only invest what you can afford to lose. - **Slippage:** When setting orders, especially on less liquid memecoins, account for slippage by setting slippage tolerance appropriately on your DEX interface. - **Taxes and Fees:** Remember to consider the impact of transaction fees on DEXs and potential tax implications of trading. # Trading Psychology and Exit Plan: - **Psychological Preparation:** Prepare mentally for high volatility and the possibility of losing your entire investment on any given position. - **Exit Strategy:** Beyond TP levels, have an overarching exit strategy. This might include setting a maximum holding period after which you'll evaluate whether to continue holding based on current performance and sentiment. This trading setup is designed for experienced traders comfortable navigating the extremely volatile and speculative market of newly listed memecoins. Success requires not just sticking to predefined SL and TP levels but also staying updated on market sentiment, news, and developments related to the specific memecoin. Remember, this strategy carries a high level of risk, and it is essential to trade responsibly."},{"prompt":"how to find which pair or crypto exchange is the best for maximum sudden price movement (aka scamwick), what does account for such fenomenon to happen? low liquidity?","completion":"To find cryptocurrency pairs or exchanges where sudden price movements, often referred to colloquially as \\"scam wicks,\\" are more likely, you indeed need to consider several factors, with liquidity being a key element. These sudden price movements can result from a variety of causes, here are the main ones: # 1. **Low Liquidity:** Low liquidity is a primary factor that accounts for the occurrence of scam wicks. In a low liquidity market, the order book is thin — there are few buy or sell orders at each price point. This means even a relatively small trade can significantly move the price, either up or down. # 2. **Whale Actions:** A \\"whale\\" in cryptocurrency is an entity or individual that holds a large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their trades can significantly impact the market. If a whale decides to sell a large quantity of a coin all at once in a low liquidity pool, it can cause the price to plummet temporarily. Conversely, large buy orders can skyrocket the price. # 3. **Market Sentiment & News:** Sometimes news or market sentiment can trigger sudden moves. For example, if there’s unexpected news regarding regulations or significant updates about a specific cryptocurrency, this can cause traders to act quickly, leading to rapid price changes. # 4. **Stop Loss Hunting:** Some traders or bots intentionally push the price to a level where they suspect many stop-loss orders are placed, triggering those orders and further driving the price in their intended direction before quickly reversing it. This often happens in markets with low liquidity, where it's easier to manipulate the price. # 5. **Leveraged Trading:** Markets or pairs that allow high leverage may also be more prone to scam wicks. Since leveraged positions can be liquidated if the price moves against the trader by a relatively small percentage, large sell-offs to liquidate positions can occur, exacerbating sudden price movements. # How to Identify Potential Markets for Scam Wicks: **1. Look for Low Liquidity Pairs:** Examine the order books of different pairs on various exchanges. Pairs with significant gaps between buy and sell orders or those with small total order sizes close to the current price are more susceptible to scam wicks. **2. Watch for High Leverage Options:** Exchanges and pairs that offer high leverage (e.g., 50x, 100x) can be more volatile. **3. Monitor Smaller Exchanges:** While larger exchanges have more stringent market protections and liquidity, smaller exchanges might not, making them more prone to rapid price movements. **4. Follow Social Media and News:** Being aware of when news breaks or sentiment shifts dramatically can help you anticipate when scam wicks might happen, especially if trading leveraged products or in low liquidity conditions. **5. Use Alerts:** Set up price alerts around key support and resistance levels for the assets you’re monitoring. Rapid breaches of these levels might indicate the start of scam wick movements. # Precautionary Measures: - **Risk Management:** Always use appropriate risk management strategies. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider using stop-loss orders to protect your investment — though be wary of placing them at common levels that could be targeted in stop loss hunting. - **Research:** Continually research and monitor the pairs and exchanges you're interested in to gather insights on potential movements. Understanding and identifying scam wicks require constant vigilance and an in-depth understanding of the market dynamics of each pair or exchange. While these movements can represent trading opportunities for the very experienced and risk-tolerant, they can also pose significant risks, especially for those new to cryptocurrency trading."},{"prompt":"can you please optimize this trading setup instead of 4 tp i want 3: -25% SL with 4 TP targets. -25%; 100% 100%; 50% (i.e. takes out your initials) 250%; 20% 400%; 20% 1000%; 10%","completion":"Optimizing your trading setup to have three take-profit (TP) targets instead of four, while maintaining a -25% stop loss (SL), requires recalibrating the profit-taking strategy for efficiency and potentially higher returns.

A function is considered smooth if it has derivatives of all orders at every point in its domain. The existence of a Taylor series that equals the function everywhere on (mathbb{R}) implies that the function is infinitely differentiable at every point in (mathbb{R}), since the Taylor series is constructed from the derivatives of the function at a point. Thus, the function must have derivatives of all orders, making it smooth by definition."},{"prompt":"Is it analytic?","completion":"Yes, if a function has a Taylor series that equals the function everywhere on (mathbb{R}) (i.e., for all (x in mathbb{R})), then the function is not only smooth but also analytic. A function is defined as analytic at a point if it can be represented by a convergent power series (i.e., its Taylor series) in some neighborhood of that point. If this condition is met everywhere on (mathbb{R}), the function is said to be analytic on (mathbb{R}). Being analytic implies not just that the function is indefinitely differentiable, but also that its behavior is completely captured by its Taylor series at any point in its domain. In other words, knowing the coefficients of the Taylor series (which are the derivatives of the function at a point) is sufficient to reconstruct the function exactly in the vicinity of that point. If the Taylor series equals the function everywhere on (mathbb{R}), it means that the function can be locally reconstructed by its series at any point across its domain, fulfilling the definition of an analytic function on (mathbb{R})."},{"prompt":"So if a function has a Taylor series at a single point that converges to the function on all of R, the function is analytic?","completion":"I apologize for the potential confusion in my prior responses. Let's clarify this important nuance regarding Taylor series and analyticity: If a function has a Taylor series expansion about a single point, and this series converges to the function for all (x) in (mathbb{R}), then yes, under that specific and quite remarkable circumstance, the function is indeed analytic on (mathbb{R}). This is because the Taylor series represents the function exactly everywhere, not just within some radius of convergence around the point of expansion, which is the common case. Typically, the convergence of a Taylor series (or any power series) is associated with a specific radius of convergence. Within this radius, the series converges to the function, and the function is said to be analytic within this interval or domain. Outside of this interval, the series may not converge, or if it does, it doesn't necessarily have to converge to the function it's derived from. However, in the exceptional case where the Taylor series about a single point converges to the function across the entire real line, this indicates that the function's behavior can be captured entirely by its derivatives at a single point for the whole domain. This makes the function analytic on (mathbb{R}). This scenario is quite special and is not true for most functions. For example, the exponential function (e^x), the sine function (sin(x)), and the cosine function (cos(x)) have Taylor series expansions at (x=0) that converge to the functions themselves for all (x) in (mathbb{R}), making these functions analytic on (mathbb{R}). However, many functions do not exhibit this property and may only be analyzed locally or within certain domains using their Taylor series."},{"prompt":"Why is it true that if a smooth function has a point where the Taylor series exists but does not converge to f, then any Taylor series cannot converge to f on the whole of R?","completion":"If a smooth function (f) has a point where the Taylor series exists but does not converge to (f), then it cannot be the case that any other Taylor series of (f) (centered at a different point) converges to (f) for all (x) in (mathbb{R}). This fact is rooted in the properties of smooth, analytic functions and the nature of Taylor series. A smooth function can have a Taylor series at every point in its domain since smoothness means the function has derivatives of all orders. However, smoothness alone does not ensure that these Taylor series will converge to the function outside of any neighborhood of the point of expansion, let alone over the entire real line. If at any point the Taylor series of a smooth function does not converge to the function itself (outside a neighborhood of the expansion point or at all), this reveals a crucial aspect of the function's behavior and analyticity: 1. **Local Behavior**: Taylor series are intrinsically local representations of functions. They are built from the derivatives at a point and are guaranteed to represent the function accurately only within a certain radius from that point, known as the radius of convergence. This radius depends on the behavior of the function's derivatives and the interval within which these derivatives do not grow too rapidly. 2. **Analyticity and Convergence**: For a function to be analytic on (mathbb{R}), its Taylor series must converge to it for all (x) in (mathbb{R}), starting from any point of expansion. If for some point in its domain the Taylor series diverges or fails to represent the function, it indicates the function is not analytic at that point. This local failure impacts the global property of being represented by a Taylor series over the entire real line. 3. **Global Consequences**: If a function's Taylor series fails to converge to it at some point, it implies a limitation in the function's analytic structure. Since analytic functions are those for which the Taylor series converges to the function at every point in their domain and represent the function exactly, a failure in this property at any point suggests the function is not globally analytic in (mathbb{R}). Therefore, no Taylor series centered at a different point could cover the whole real line successfully where another has failed, respecting the function’s non-analytic nature on (mathbb{R}). In summary, the convergence of a function's Taylor series at a particular point is deeply tied to its local behavior around that point. If a smooth function has even one point where its Taylor series diverges or fails to represent the function accurately, it indicates a broader characteristic of the function that prevents any Taylor series (regardless of the center point) from converging to the function globally across (mathbb{R}). This does not preclude partial or local representations by Taylor series but highlights a constraint on global analytic representation."},{"prompt":"Please be more specific","completion":"To clarify and address the specific reasoning behind why the existence of at least one point where a smooth function's Taylor series does not converge to the function implies that no Taylor series of the function can converge to the function on the whole of (mathbb{R}), let's dive into a more detailed explanation. # Analytic Functions and Convergence of Taylor Series An **analytic function** is a function that can be represented by a convergent Taylor series in the neighborhood of any point in its domain. This means that for a function (f) to be analytic on (mathbb{R}), its Taylor series must converge to (f(x)) for all (x in mathbb{R}), and this must be true around any point where the series is centered. # The Implication of a Non-Converging Taylor Series 1. **Localized Convergence**: The convergence of a Taylor series is inherently a local property. If the Taylor series for a function (f) centered at a point (a) converges to (f(x)) for all (x) in a neighborhood of (a), the function is locally represented by its Taylor series at (a). 2. **Non-Convergence at a Point**: If there exists a point, say (b), where the Taylor series of (f) centered at (b) does not converge to (f(x)) (or diverges, or converges to something else), this is indicative of a fundamental characteristic of (f) around (b). It suggests that (f) cannot be represented by a power series in this region, which is a hallmark of non-analytic behavior at (b). 3. **Non-Analyticity and Global Representation**: If (f) is not analytic at point (b) due to the divergence of its Taylor series, (f) is not analytic on (mathbb{R}). For a function to be analytic on all of (mathbb{R}), it must not only be smooth (have derivatives of all orders everywhere) but also be representable by a converging Taylor series everywhere. If there's even one point where this fails, the function loses the analytic designation globally. 4. **Global Implications**: Given a smooth function (f) with a Taylor series that diverges or does not converge to (f(x)) at some point (b), we can conclude that (f) is not globally representable by any Taylor series across the entire real line. This is because analyticity, and hence global convergence of the Taylor series to the function, requires this representation to be possible at every point in the function's domain. A failure at a single point suggests that there is no single Taylor series centered at any point that can converge to the function on the entirety of (mathbb{R}), as analyticity is a global property that gets invalidated by local failures. # Conclusion Therefore, the specificity of the claim that if at least one point exists where the Taylor series does not converge to the smooth function (f), then (f) cannot be represented by a Taylor series on all of (mathbb{R}), touches on the intrinsic nature of analytic functions. Essentially, analyticity requires the function to be locally represented by its Taylor series at every point, converging to the function within some radius. A failure in this requirement at any point excludes the possibility of the function being globally analytic or being represented by a Taylor series across the whole real line."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: ПриветASSISTANT:","completion":"Привет!

[나도 예전에는 저랬겠지. 없는 사람들 뒤에서 조용히 조롱하고 무시하고….] “참, 성국이 엄마는 대학 어디 나왔어요?” “저는 고등학교만 나왔어요. 서촌 여상이요.” “풉-.” 몇 명 엄마들은 비웃음을 겨우 참고 있었다. 철의 여인은 조용히 눈을 내리깔고 알았다는 듯이 커피를 마셨다. 아마 이게 신호일 것이다. 제일 먼저 나선 것은 삼전 그룹 방계인 검찰총장 며느리였다. 김주성의 엄마이기도 했다. “사촌 오빠 목숨 구한 것치고는 너무 과분한 대우 아니야?” [지금 프랑스어로 말하는 거냐?] 시작은 프랑스어였다. 엄마는 아무것도 모른 채 빙긋 웃으며 여자들의 얼굴을 살폈다. 한때 가수였던 여자도 말을 보탰다. 물론 프랑스어로. “우리랑 수준이 너무 안 맞네요. 여상이라뇨.” [아줌마, 지금 여상에 붙인 관사 틀렸어!] 아무래도 저 가수도 이 사회에 발붙이기 위해 속성으로 프랑스어를 배운 모양이었다. 그런데 문법 틀린 것을 눈치챈 건 철의 여인과 나 정도였다. 여자들은 계속해서 프랑스어로 떠들어댔다. 아이들은 영어 외에 제2외국어를 하기에는 아직 어렸다. 프랑스어로 나누는 그들의 대화는 더 노골적으로 변했다. “아무래도 아이들한테도 같이 놀아주지 말라고 해야겠어요. 친구 없으면 스스로 옮기겠죠.” “미진이가 성국이를 엄청 챙긴다는데, 걱정이네요.” “미진이는 내년이면 미국으로 갈 거예요. 올해까지만 견디는지 보죠.” 철의 여인은 능숙한 프랑스어로 대답했다. 엄마와 김미영 매니저는 자신들 빼고 그들만 대화하는 것이 따돌리는 의미란 건 알았지만, 뭔 소리인지 몰라 잠자코 있었다. 이 자리에서 아무것도 없는 두 사람이 나선다고 될 일도 아니었다. 그렇다면 내가 또 나서야 하나? 프랑스어까지 커밍아웃하면 곤란한데…. 미진이가 나에게 제일 큰 케이크를 건넸다. “성국아, 이거 먹어.” “응, 고마워.” 내년에 미국으로 간다니 그나마 다행이었다. 뒤에서 다시 여자들의 프랑스 수다가 시작됐다. “없는 애가 참 눈치도 없네요. 여기가 어딘 줄 알고 꼴랑 꽃만 들고 와요.” “없는 집안이 그렇죠, 뭐. 엄마, 아빠가 애 얼굴 팔아서 돈 버는 집안이 뭐, 안 봐도 뻔하죠.” 검찰총장의 며느리의 마지막 말에 한계에 다다랐다. 더는 참고 있을 수가 없었다. 나는 포크를 소리 나게 내려놨다. 뒤에서 이세희 엄마가 종알거렸다. “정말 배운 게 없나 보네. 디저트 포크가 뭔지도 모르잖아요.” 나는 이세희 엄마와 김주성 엄마를 타깃으로 설정했다. 의자를 빼고 조용히 일어나 두 사람을 쳐다봤다. “어머, 여기가 감히 누구 생일인 줄 알고 저러나 몰라.” “저 엄마는 아무 말도 못 알아들으니 웃고만 있네요.” “아줌마들. 저기요.” 나는 프랑스어로 그들의 말을 끊었다. 물론 아직 다섯 살짜리의 발음이라 조금 어눌했지만, 분명 다들 내가 무슨 말을 하는지는 알아먹는 것 같았다. “겨우 저 단어 하나 어디서 들었나 보네.” 김주성의 엄마였다. [겨우 한 단어가 아닌 것을 이제부터 보여주지!] 나는 숨을 한 번 크게 들이쉬고, 프랑스어를 내뱉기 시작했다. “아줌마, 지금 저희 부모님 모욕하신 것 같은데요. 저희 부모님은 없는 집에서 태어나셔서 비록 많이 못 배우셨지만, 제가 지금 방송에 나올 만큼 잘난 얼굴과 댁의 자식들도 못 하는 프랑스어쯤은 혼자 독학할 정도의 능력 모두 저희 부모님한테 물려받은 거거든요.” 숨을 한 번 골랐다. 여자들은 당황한 얼굴로 서로를 쳐다봤다. “그러니까, 돈만 많은 당신들보다야 저에게 이런 재능을 물려주신 우리 부모님이 더 훌륭하신 분들이라는 건 좀 아셨으면 좋겠습니다.” 내가 긴 문장을 속사포로 말하자, 다들 입을 꼭 다물었다. 제대로 알아들은 것은 철의 여인 정도였다. 나머지도 대강의 의미는 알아들었고, 가수 출신의 이세희 엄마만 이리저리 눈알을 굴리며 눈치를 살폈다. 철의 여인이 조용히 자리에서 일어났다. 표정을 잘 드러내지 않는 얼굴이지만, 평소보다 더 굳은 얼굴이었다. 철의 여인은 나를 뚫어져라 쳐다보더니 프랑스어로 묻기 시작했다. “성국아, 너 프랑스어 어디서 배웠니?” “TV에서 하는 프랑스어 강좌 보고요.” “프랑스어 관사 하나 틀리지 않던데. 따로 배운 거니?” “책을 좀 많이 읽었어요.” 나는 철의 여인이 묻는 말에 바로바로 대답했다. 철의 여인의 전공이 프랑스어였다. 그래서 이 여인들의 뒷담화 언어가 프랑스어가 된 것이었다. 그리고 내가 프랑스어 관사 하나 틀리지 않고 말할 수 있는 것도 다 저 여인 덕분이다. 어릴 적부터 나에게 혹독하리만큼 프랑스어 공부를 시켰다. 엄마를 비롯한 모든 사람들이 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. 철의 여인은 자리에서 일어나더니 굳은 얼굴로 프랑스어로 내게 말했다. “오늘 생일 파티에 와줘서 고맙구나. 그럼, 미진이랑 잘 놀고 가렴.” “저기요, 아줌마.” 나는 철의 여인을 불러 세웠다. 철의 여인은 얇은 입술을 일자로 다문 채 나를 바라봤다. “저희 엄마에게 사과해 주세요.” “알아듣지도 못한 말을 사과하는 건 아니지 않을까?” “사모님들이 겨우 한 명 왕따 시킨 거는 안 창피하세요? 미진이가 이런 엄마의 행동을 알면 좋을 것 같지는 않은데요.” “…….” 철의 여인은 가만히 숨을 내쉬더니 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “아드님이 참 영특하네요. 프랑스어가 익숙해서 저도 모르게 나온 거 사과드릴게요. 남은 시간 잘 보내고 가시죠.” “아닙니다. 제가 많이 부족한데, 초대해주신 것만으로도 감사합니다.” 엄마는 한결 가벼워진 얼굴이었다. 철의 여인의 사과에 다른 엄마들도 미안하단 말을 건넸다. 나는 다시 전미진 옆자리에 앉았다. 전미진이 턱에 두 손을 괴고 나를 황홀하게 쳐다봤다. [부담스럽다, 동생아.] 그러거나 말거나 전미진은 나만 바라봤다. “성국아, 너 프랑스어도 해?” “좀.” “성국이, 천재!” [아이큐가 121이라 천재는 아니야. 사양할게, 그 말은.] 나는 다시 포크를 들어 케이크를 먹었다. 어쨌든 이 케이크는 정말 맛있었다. * * * “성국이가 영어에 프랑스어도 완벽하게 한다고?” 전재형 회장이 놀란 얼굴로 양 비서를 쳐다봤다. “네, 회장님. 저희도 모두 놀랐습니다. 더군다나 모두 교육 방송 강좌나 책을 보고 익혔다고 합니다.” “그게 가능한가?” “영재 테스트 받았는데, 이상한 점이 있습니다. 아이큐는 솔직히 121로 평균보다 조금 높은 수준인데, 모든 항목에서 상위 0.1프로에 들었습니다. 특히 사고력이나 학습 능력 등이 정말 탁월하다고 하더라고요. 테스트하신 선생님께서는 아무래도 성국이가 아이큐 검사 때 딴청을 피운 게 아닌가 의심하더라고요. 머리가 좋은 아이들의 경우 일부러 그러는 경향이 있다고 합니다.” 전재형 회장의 입가가 슬쩍 올라갔다. “성국 군 계속 팔로우하게. 한 명의 천재를 후원하는 게 기업 이미지에도 좋을 수 있지 않은가. 나중에 우리 기업에도 도움이 될 거고.” “그렇게 하겠습니다.” 양 비서가 나가려는 찰나, 철의 여인이 들어섰다. 전재형 회장은 의외의 방문에 조금 당황했다. 철의 여인과는 지난 몇 년간 관계가 최악으로 치달았다. 아버지 전주신 회장이 살아 계실 때야 어쩔 수 없이 한 지붕 아래 살았지만, 회장이 된 이후에 전재형은 독립을 준비 중이었다. 그게 어차피 서로에게 편한 일이었다. “문 좀 닫고 나가주세요.” 철의 여인이 낮은 목소리로 하명하자, 양 비서는 조용히 문을 닫았다. 전재형은 다 못 본 서류를 훑으며 철의 여인을 흘깃 쳐다봤다. 뭔가 단단히 할 말이 있는 모양이다. “무슨 일이야?” “성국이, 당신 아들이야?” 예상치 못한 반격이었다. “말도 안 되는 소리인 거 알면서 왜 물어. 이미 뒷조사 다 해봤을 거 아니야.” “그러니까. 너무 이해가 안 돼.” “고아에 고졸인 부모 밑에서 그런 아이가 나왔다는 게 당신 머리로 이해가 안 되는 거 아니야?” “아니. 그럴 수는 있지. 천재들은 어느 부모 밑에서든 나오니까. 어떻게 길러지는지가 더 문제지.” 철의 여인은 팔짱을 끼고 전재형을 쳐다봤다. “근데 내가 궁금한 건, 당신이 정말 그 집안에 사심이 하나도 없냐 하는 거야.” 전재형은 머리를 절레절레 흔들었다. “지금 내가 남의 와이프까지 넘보는 그런 난봉꾼이라고 생각하는 거야?” “아니. 난 그게 아닌데.” 철의 여인의 눈빛이 날카로워졌다. “당신. 태국이한테 이미 실망했잖아.” “…….” 전재형 회장은 태연한 척 서류를 마저 정리했다. 철의 여인은 당황하더니 다음 말을 내뱉었다. “그 아이한테 다른 것을 바라는 거 아니야?” “삼전 그룹은 인재들에게 쭉 후원을 해줬어. 나는 더 할 말이 없어. 참, 나 다음 주에 삼성동으로 나갈 거야. 태국이랑 미진이 미국 유학 좀 더 빨리 추진했으면 좋겠어. 당신도 같이 나가면 더할 나위 없이 좋고. 당신 말대로 태국이 이미 실망스러운데, 미국 가서 더 실망스러워지면 안 되잖아.” 전재형 회장은 노트북을 열었고, 곧이어 쾅 문이 닫히는 소리가 들렸다. “흠….” 전재형 회장은 턱을 매만졌다. 사실 성국이란 아이에게 내심 기대가 생긴 것은 사실이다. 그건 어디까지나 삼전 그룹의 인재로였다. 그런데 철의 여인의 이야기를 듣고 나니 다른 생각이 슬며시 떠올랐다. 장남이자 유일한 아들인 태국이는 이미 후계자로서 미달이었다. 성격도 옹졸하고, 감정 기복도 심했다. 거기다 학업 성적도 좋지 않았다. 조기 유학을 보내는 이유도 그것이었다. 괜히 국내에서 돈 들여 학교 보내봤자, 부정 입학이니 말만 나오느니 일찌감치 미국의 대학을 노리는 게 나아 보였다. 하지만 이런 비정상적인 루트는 서울대 출신으로 바글바글한 임원진들의 인정을 받기 어려웠다. 다들 흠만 잡으려고 노력했다. 전재형 회장은 자신의 과거를 돌이켜봤다. 최고가 되기 위해 미친 듯이 노력했던 자신의 과거. 그래서 얻은 이 자리. 그런데 아들인 태국은 이미 그러기는 어려워 보였다. 그렇다면 자신을 이을 대리자를 어서 빨리 선택해서 키우는 것도 나쁜 일이 아니었다. 성인이 된 후에 누군가를 선택한다는 것은 어려운 문제였다. 어릴 적부터 삼전 그룹에 완벽하게 속한 인간으로 키워야 자신의 자리를 물려줄 수도 있는 거였다. ‘아직 다섯 살인데….’ 전재형 회장은 생각을 한 템포 쉬었다. 자신이 너무 빨리 나가는 것 같았기 때문이다. 하지만 분명한 것은 전성국이라는 아이의 미래가 점점 궁금해진다는 거였다. * * * “성국이가 프랑스어도 한다고?” 아빠가 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. [아빠, 천재 처음 봐? 아, 맞다. 나 천재 아니지. 아이큐 121이지.] 시무룩. 나는 아빠가 싸온 보쌈 고기를 우울한 얼굴로 아작아작 씹어댔다. 기분은 우울해도 아빠가 삶은 보쌈 고기는 맛있었다. 엄마는 옆에서 민국이를 안은 채 아빠에게 오늘 있던 일을 늘어놨다. “미진이 엄마. 그러니까….” [삼전 그룹 회장 사모님!] “암튼 그분도 엄청 놀랐어. 양 비서님이 나중에 말씀해 주시는데, 성국이 불어가 아주 완벽했다고 했어.” “진짜?” 아빠는 내 얼굴을 빤히 쳐다봤다. [아빠, 얼굴 닳아. 그만 봐.] “성국아.” “왜에?” 나는 이제 살짝 짜증 묻은 다섯 살의 말투로 물었다. “성국아, 너 정말 프랑스어도 해?” “…….” 대답 대신 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국아, 너 아빠가 누구야?” “아빠? 여기.” 나는 아빠를 손가락으로 가리켰다. “그럼, 엄마는?” “엄마? 여기.” 나는 엄마를 손가락으로 가리켰다. 곧 아빠는 흐뭇한 미소를 짓더니 내 뺨을 손바닥으로 비벼댔다. [아빠, 대체 왜 이러는 거야?] “소영아, 우리가 이런 천재를 낳은 게 믿어져?” “근데 자기야. 우리 성국이 아이큐가 121이래. 평균보다 조금 높다는데, 천재는 아니지 않을까?” 탁! 나는 손으로 탁자를 내려쳤다. 내 마음의 스크래치.

I couldn't hold back any longer. I loudly set down my fork. Behind me, Isehee's mom chattered. \\"She really must be uneducated. Doesn't even know what a dessert fork is.\\" I targeted Isehee's mom and Kim Jusung's mom. I quietly stood up and looked at the two women. \\"Oh, who do they think they are, showing up at this birthday party?\\" \\"That mom just smiles because she doesn't understand anything.\\" \\"Ladies. Excuse me.\\" I interrupted them in French. Of course, my pronunciation might have been a bit awkward since I was only five years old, but it seemed like they understood what I was saying. \\"She must have picked up that one word from somewhere.\\" It was Kim Jusung's mom. [I'll show you it's not just one word from now on!] I took a deep breath and started spouting French. \\"Ladies, it seems like you're insulting my parents. My parents, though born into a poor family and not highly educated, have passed on to me the ability to appear on TV with a face worth showing and to self-learn French, something even your children cannot do.\\" I took a breath. The women looked at each other with flustered faces. \\"So, my parents who gave me such talents are far more admirable than you who only have money.\\" After I rapidly fired off a long sentence, everyone shut their mouths. The Iron Lady was probably the only one who fully understood. The others got the gist of it, and only Isehee's mom, who was a singer, looked around, trying to gauge the situation. The Iron Lady quietly stood up. Her face, usually not very expressive, looked even more stern than usual. The Iron Lady stared at me and then started asking in French. \\"Sunguk, where did you learn French?\\" \\"I watched French lessons on TV.\\" \\"You didn't get a single article wrong. Did you study separately?\\" \\"I read a lot of books.\\" I immediately answered the Iron Lady's questions. The Iron Lady's major was French. That's why these women chose French as their gossip language. And the reason I could speak French without missing a single article was all thanks to this woman. She had forced me to study French rigorously since I was young. Everyone, including my mom, looked at me with surprised eyes. The Iron Lady stood up and said to me in French with a stern face. \\"Thank you for coming to today's birthday party. Have a good time with Mijin.\\" \\"Excuse me, ma'am.\\" I stopped the Iron Lady. The Iron Lady looked at me with her thin lips pressed into a straight line. \\"Please apologize to my mom.\\" \\"Apologizing for something she didn't understand might not be necessary, right?\\" \\"Aren't you ashamed that the ladies managed to ostracize just one person? I don't think Mijin would like to know about her mom's behavior.\\" \\"...\\" The Iron Lady sighed quietly and then looked at my mom. \\"Your son is very clever. I apologize for speaking out of turn in French. Please enjoy the rest of your time here.\\" \\"No, it's okay. I'm grateful just to be invited.\\" Mom's face lightened up. Following the Iron Lady's apology, the other moms also offered their apologies. I sat back down next to Mijin. Mijin propped her chin on her hands and looked at me adoringly. [This is a bit too much, little sister.] Regardless, Mijin only had eyes for me. \\"Sunguk, you speak French too?\\" \\"A bit.\\" \\"Sunguk, you're a genius!\\" [I'm not a genius with an IQ of 121. I'll pass on that compliment.] I picked up my fork again and ate the cake. After all, the cake was really delicious. * * * \\"Sunguk is perfect in both English and French?\\" Chairman Jeon Jaehyung looked at Secretary Yang with a surprised face. \\"Yes, Chairman. We were all surprised. Moreover, he learned everything from educational broadcasts and books.\\" \\"Is that even possible?\\" \\"We had him take a genius test, and there was something strange. Honestly, his IQ is 121, which is slightly above average, but he scored in the top 0.1% in all categories. Especially his thinking and learning abilities were said to be exceptional. The teacher who tested him suspected that Sunguk might have been pretending during the IQ test. It's a tendency seen in smart kids.\\" Chairman Jeon Jaehyung's lips slightly curled up. \\"Keep following Sunguk. Sponsoring a genius could be good for the company's image. It might help our company later.\\" \\"I'll do that.\\" As Secretary Yang was about to leave, the Iron Lady entered. Chairman Jeon Jaehyung was slightly taken aback by the unexpected visit. His relationship with the Iron Lady had been at its worst for the past few years. While Father Chairman Jeon Jushin was alive, they had no choice but to live under the same roof, but after becoming chairman, Jeon Jaehyung was preparing to live independently. It was better for both parties. \\"Please close the door on your way out.\\" As the Iron Lady commanded in a low voice, Secretary Yang quietly closed the door. Jeon Jaehyung glanced at the Iron Lady while flipping through some unfinished documents. She seemed to have something serious to say. \\"What's the matter?\\" \\"Is Sunguk your son?\\" It was an unexpected counterattack. \\"Don't ask something you know is nonsense. You must have already investigated.\\" \\"That's why. It doesn't make sense to me.\\" \\"You're not puzzled because a child like that came from a family of orphans and high school graduates, are you?\\" \\"No. That's possible. Geniuses can come from any family. It's more about how they're raised.\\" The Iron Lady crossed her arms and looked at Jeon Jaehyung. \\"But what I'm curious about is whether you really have no personal interest in that family.\\" Jeon Jaehyung shook his head. \\"Do you think I'm the kind of libertine who covets someone else's wife?\\" \\"No, that's not what I meant.\\" The Iron Lady's gaze sharpened. \\"You're already disappointed in Taeguk.\\" \\"...\\" Jeon Jaehyung pretended to be calm and finished organizing the documents. The Iron Lady, flustered, blurted out her next words. \\"Are you expecting something else from that child?\\" \\"Samjeon Group has always supported talented individuals. I have nothing more to say. By the way, I'm moving to Samseong-dong next week. I'd like you to expedite Taeguk and Mijin's US study plans. It would be best if you could come with us. As you said, Taeguk is already disappointing, and we can't let him become more disappointing in the US.\\" Chairman Jeon Jaehyung opened his laptop, and soon the door slammed shut. \\"Hmm…\\" Chairman Jeon Jaehyung stroked his chin. He was indeed starting to have expectations for the child named Sunguk. But that was purely as a talent for Samjeon Group. However, after hearing the Iron Lady's words, another thought began to creep in. His eldest and only son, Taeguk, was already falling short as a successor. He was petty, emotionally unstable, and his academic performance was not good. That was the reason for sending him abroad early. Sending him to school in Korea with money would only lead to rumors of unfair admission, so aiming for a US university seemed better. But this abnormal route was hard to get recognized by the executives, all graduates of Seoul National University. They all tried to find faults. Chairman Jeon Jaehyung reflected on his past. His past efforts to become the best and the position he had achieved. But it seemed unlikely that Taeguk could do the same. Then, choosing and nurturing a successor as soon as possible wasn't a bad idea. Choosing someone after they've grown up was a difficult issue. They had to be raised as a perfect part of Samjeon Group from a young age to inherit his position. 'He's only five years old….' Chairman Jeon Jaehyung paused his thoughts. It seemed he was moving too fast. But one thing was clear: he was becoming more curious about the future of the child named Sunguk. * * * \\"Sunguk speaks French too?\\" Dad looked at me with surprised eyes. [Dad, is it your first time seeing a genius? Oh, right. I'm not a genius. My IQ is 121.] Feeling down. I chewed on the bossam pork Dad brought with a gloomy face. Even though I felt down, the bossam pork Dad cooked was delicious. Mom, holding Minguk next to her, told Dad about what happened today. \\"Mijin's mom. So….\\" [The wife of Samjeon Group's chairman!] \\"Anyway, she was really surprised. Secretary Yang told me later that Sunguk's French was perfect.\\" \\"Really?\\" Dad stared at my face. [Dad, my face is going to wear out. Stop looking.] \\"Sunguk.\\" \\"What?\\" I asked in the slightly annoyed tone of a five-year-old. \\"Sunguk, do you really speak French too?\\" \\"…\\" Instead of answering, I nodded. \\"Sunguk, who's your dad?\\" \\"Dad? Here.\\" I pointed at Dad with my finger. \\"Then, who's your mom?\\" \\"Mom? Here.\\" I pointed at Mom with my finger. Soon, Dad smiled warmly and rubbed my cheek with his palm. [Dad, why are you doing this?] \\"So Young, can you believe we gave birth to such a genius?\\" \\"But, honey. Sunguk's IQ is 121. It's a bit above average, but he's not a genius, right?\\" Thump! I slammed my hand on the table. The scratch of my heart. [How could I, this Jeon Sunguk, have an IQ of 121!]"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[동탄이구만. 다음은 동탄 아래 평택이고.] 나는 내 짧고 오동통한 손을 바라봤다. [10년만 늙었어도 땅 사두는 건데….] 엄마는 맥주를 마시며 나를 쳐다봤다. 맥주 덕분인지 아까보다 한결 편안해진 얼굴이었다. “성국아, 성국이는 뉴스가 재미있어?” “녜에. 엄마.” 나는 엄마를 힘차게 불렀다. “왜에?” “동탄.” [아차, 화성이라고 해야 하나.] “동탄? 그게 뭐야?” “엄마.” “성국이가 오늘따라 엄마를 많이 찾네. 왜에?” “땅.” 나는 엄마에게 해맑게 말했다. “땅? 그걸 왜?” “땅. 사고파.” “땅을 사고 싶다고?” 막 주방을 정리하고 나오던 아빠가 문득 멈춰 섰다. “소영아, 지금 성국이가 땅 사고 싶다고 한 거야?” “그런 거 같긴 한데….” [그런 것 같은 게 아니라, 땅 사고 싶다고! 내가 삼전 그룹 이동하는 땅 다 안다고. 거기 근처 어디라도 사면 대박 나는 건 한순간이야, 엄마. 아빠!] 나는 중얼거렸지만, 역시 다섯 살은 아직 한계가 있었다. 아빠가 얼른 나를 안아 들었다. 아빠는 좀 전과 달리 해맑은 얼굴이었다. “소영아, 내가 주방 정리하면서 생각해 봤거든. 성국이가 천재는 맞는 거 같고.” [당연한 말씀.] “네가 놀란 것도 알겠는데, 우리가 성국이 진짜 잘 키울 수 있을 것 같아.” “오빠, 그게 무슨 말이야? 우린 고등학교밖에 못 나왔잖아.” “그러니까. 우리가 많이 배운 사람들이었으면 성국이가 마음대로 공부하게 못 했을지도 몰라. 성국이가 어릴 적에 뉴스 좋아해서 많이 틀어주고, 책도 읽고 싶은 거 다 사주고 했잖아. 그게 오히려 좋은 교육인지 몰라. 애가 하고 싶은 대로 마음껏 펼치게 둔 거잖아.” “그런가….” 엄마는 영 못 미더운 눈치였다. 나도 아빠의 가설이 믿음직하진 않았다. 나의 이 많은 지식과 능력은 사실 혹독한 삼전 그룹의 스파르타식 교육 덕분에 탄생한 것이었다. 물론, 나의 뛰어난 머리가 없었다면 불가능한 일이기도 했다. 하지만 확실히 이번 생에서는 엄마, 아빠가 조금 가방끈이 짧은 게 도움이 되긴 했다. 겨우 다섯 살짜리가 <맨큐의 경제학>을 잡는다고 사주는 부모가 어디 있겠는가. 나는 아빠의 품에 폭 안겼다. 평소 같으면 발버둥을 치고, 권투 자세를 취하며 놀아달라고 했겠지만 오늘따라 아빠가 기특해 보였다. [이건 보나스.] 나는 아빠의 볼에 쪽 입도 맞췄다. 아빠의 입술이 승천하는 게 보였다. “봐봐. 성국이도 내 말이 맞다고 하잖아.” “그런가…. 자기야, 그래도 성국이가 땅 사달라고 한다고 사주면 안 돼.” [엄마, 내 돈으로 내가 살 거야!] “성국이 돈으로 성국이가 산다고 하면 말릴 수 없지.” [옳지! 아빠, 오늘 좀 도움이 되네.] 나는 얼른 아빠에게 또 뽀뽀를 날렸다. “소영아, 근데 진짜 성국이가 천재면 우리 어디 기관에 가서 아이큐 검사나 이런 거 받아봐야 하는 거 아니야? 요즘은 영재들은 특별 교육도 어릴 때부터 시킨다고 TV에서 그러더라고.” “내가 미영 언니랑 상의해보고 알아볼게.” “소영아, 근데 너무 신기하지 않아?” “뭐가?” “어떻게 나랑 너 사이에서 이런 천재가 태어났을까?” [내 말이.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 아빠는 유모차에서 자고 있는 민국이를 쳐다봤다. “소영아, 설마 우리 민국이도 천재 아닐까?” [아빠! 그건 아니지!] * * * [훗, 이건 껌이지.] 아이큐 테스트 검사지가 내 눈앞에 놓여 있었다. 내가 TV만 보고 영어를 배웠고, 원어민 선생님인 토마스와 막힘없이 영어로 이야기를 나눴다는 사실을 안 양 비서 아저씨는 부모님께 영재 테스트를 권했다. 유치원이 쉬는 날, 나는 일하는 아빠 대신 엄마와 김미영 매니저와 영재 테스트를 받으러 기관에 와 있었다. 영재 테스트라고 해도 크게 어려운 건 없었다. 처음엔 여러 아이들과 평범하게 어울리며 내가 사고하는 방식이나, 글을 해석하는 능력 등을 관계자가 지켜보고 평가했다. 여러 가지 평가가 이어졌고, 이제 마지막으로 아이큐 테스트가 시작됐다. 나는 얼른 테스트를 마치고, 엄마를 보며 손을 들었다. “끄읕!” 관계자가 얼른 들어오더니 테스트지를 걷어갔다. “양 비서님이 부탁하셔서 바로 결과가 나오도록 했습니다. 잠시만 기다려 주세요.” [결과 안 봐도 뻔해. 나 저번 생에서 167이었다고. 그 아이큐가 하늘로 날아갔겠어, 땅으로 꺼졌겠어?] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. * * * “오늘 성국이가 하는 행동이나 학습 능력을 관찰한 결과, 굉장히 놀라웠습니다. 모두들 천재 아니냐고 다들 그러더라고요.” 앞머리를 한껏 올린 긴 머리의 여자가 나에 대해서 설명했다. 엄마는 살짝 초조해 보였다. 나는 엄마의 손을 꼭 잡았다. [엄마, 엄마 아들 천재 맞아.] “그런데 말이에요.” [응, 뭐가 그런데야? 앞에 좋은 이야기 했는데, 그런데 들어가면 반전이 있다는 건데….] 여자는 테스트지를 앞으로 내밀었다. 테스트지에는 각종 수치를 그래프로 그려놓은 표가 있었다. 학습 능력과 인지, 사고 능력 모두 다 최고치로 그래프를 뚫고 나갈 기세였다. 그런데…. “아이큐는 너무 평범해요. 이런 아이라면 적어도 130 이상은 되어야 할 텐데. 성국이는 121입니다.” […뭐, 뭐라고? 잠깐만, 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 내 아이큐가 121이라고?] 나는 너무 놀라 여자를 다시 빤히 쳐다봤다. [여자, 다시 말해봐. 거짓말이지? 나, 저번 생에서 아이큐가 167에 멘사 회원이었다니까!] 김미영도 의아한 얼굴이었다. “선생님, 다른 게 이렇게 좋은데 아이큐만 나쁠 수가 있나요?” “121도 나쁜 건 아니에요. 이 정도면 평균보다 높은 편이에요. 다만, 성국이의 학습 능력이나 기타 모든 게 상위 0.1프로에 속한다고 말하는 것도 미안할 정도로 최고치인데, 아이큐가 거기에 비해 평범한 거죠.” [아니야, 믿을 수 없어.] 나는 여자가 내민 테스트지를 얼른 앞으로 당겼다. 그런데 진짜 아이큐는 121이었다. 이게 도대체 어떻게 된 일이지? 여자는 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “이렇게 행동하는 것도 정말 다섯 살이라고는 믿기지 않거든요. 아무래도 아이큐 테스트 때 성국이가 꾀를 부린 것 같아요. 너무 뛰어난 아이들 사이에서는 종종 있는 일이에요.” “그런 거죠?” 엄마는 그제야 안심했다. 하지만 반대로 나는 절망했다. [나 사실… 정말 열심히 풀었어. 나의 온 힘을 다해서 아이큐 테스트 한 거라고….] 어깨가 쭉 처졌다. 선생님은 여러 가지 지표를 보여주며 엄마와 김미영 매니저에게 설명했다. “성국이는 정말 다른 분야에서는 독보적이에요. 솔직히 어느 성인보다도 뛰어난 이해력과 어휘력을 가지고 있어서 저도 무척 놀랐어요.” 나는 더는 아무 말도 들리지 않았다. [내가 아이큐 121이라니! 평범이라니! 이번 생에서는 얼굴만 주고 머리는 안 준 건가!] “성국아, 다음 스케줄 가야지?” [일 안 하기로 했는데, 무슨 스케줄?] “전미진이랑 같은 반이라며?” 김미영 매니저가 물었다. “네에에.” 나는 힘없이 대답했다. “양 비서님이 미진이가 너 생일에 초대했다고 하던데, 맞아?” [아, 깜빡했네. 그만큼 안 중요하단 거야. 안 갈래.] 나는 의자를 빼고 일어나 뒷짐을 지고 뚜벅뚜벅 걸었다. “미진이가 엄마랑 나도 다 초대했는데….” [전미진이 초대한 게 아니라 양 비서 아저씨가 같이 오라고 했겠지.] 나는 잠시 멈춰서 곰곰이 생각이라는 것을 했다. 전미진은 물론 정말 너무 싫은 여동생이었다. 물론 저번 생에서. 이번 생에도 엮일 일 같은 것은 만들고 싶지 않았다. 하지만 전미진의 약점을 나는 누구보다 잘 알고 있다. 얼빠라는 사실. 더불어 자신이 좋아하는 사람에게는 간과 쓸개를 스스로 갖다주는 성격이라는 것. 어차피 지금 전미진은 삼전 그룹 유치원의 피라미드 제일 꼭대기이다. 삼전 유치원에서 흙수저를 담당하고 있는 나로서는 잘 보여서 나쁠 건 없었다. 나는 겨우 기운 차려서 엄마에게 걸어갔다. “엄마. 선물 사야 해.” “그래, 가는 길에 백화점에 가서 선물 사자. 근데, 그런 부잣집 딸한테 없는 게 있을까?” [걱정 마. 내가 아니까.] 나는 먼저 문을 박차고 나갔다. * * * “꽃 사주고 싶어, 성국아?” “네에!” 나는 꽃가게 안을 두리번거리다 핑크빛 장미를 골랐다. 장미 싫어하는 여자 못 봤고, 핑크 싫어하는 여자아이도 못 봤다. 전미진도 특별히 다를 게 없는 아이였다. 김미영은 꽃가게에 있는 핑크색 장미를 모두 결재했다. “언니, 다른 선물은 안 사도 될까요?” “다른 것은 뭘 사야 할지 모르겠어요. 난 결혼도 안 했잖아요.” “저도 딸은 없어서….” [내가 꽃 들고 들어가면 그게 곧 선물이야.] 그리고 내가 내민 꽃을 받아 든 전미진은 정말 입이 찢어져라 미소 지었다. “와, 너무 예뻐.” “생일 축하해, 미진아.” “성국아, 너무 고마워. 이리 와.” 전미진은 내 손을 잡고 한남동에 위치한 자택 내 별채로 이끌었다. 별채는 아빠가 집에서 손님들을 대접할 때 주로 사용했지만, 종종 자식들의 생일 파티나 엄마의 모임에도 이용했다. 구석에는 삼전 그룹 유치원의 A반 원생 모두와 그들의 엄마로 보이는 여자들이 앉아 있었다. 익숙한 얼굴도 몇 있었다. 검찰총장의 손자인 김주성의 어머니는 삼전 그룹 전재형 회장과는 사촌지간이었다. 계열사 하나 맡아서 독립한 집안이었다. 삼전 병원의 병원장 손녀 이세희의 어머니는 한때 유명한 가수였다. 다들 한 다리 건너면 아는 인물들. 전미진은 핑크 장미 꽃다발을 안아 들고는 철의 여인에게 가서 자랑을 했다. “엄마, 성국이가 사왔떠.” “센스 있구나.” 철의 여인은 나를 쓱 한번 쳐다보고는 엄마를 쳐다봤다. 철의 여인의 시선이 엄마의 머리부터 발끝까지 찬찬히 훑었다. [왜 저런 눈으로 보지? 설마….] 철의 여인이 바로 옆자리를 가리키며 엄마를 불렀다. “성국이 엄마, 여기 앉아요.” “아, 네.” 엄마는 바로 철의 여인 옆자리에 앉았다. [흠…. 불안한데.] 철의 여인은 겉으로는 우아한 척했지만, 사실 사람들을 철저히 계급으로 나누고 자신이 말을 섞을 사람과 아닌 사람을 구분했다. 그런데 엄마를 옆으로 부르다니…. 뭔가 개운치 않았다. 나는 자연스레 전미진의 옆자리에 앉았고, 철의 여인과도 아주 가까운 자리였다. 철의 여인과 엄마의 대화를 감시하기에 딱 좋았다. 전미진은 나에게 케이크도 먼저, 음식도 먼저, 음료도 먼저 건넸다. “성국아, 이거 먹어.” “고마워.” 모두 나를 주시하는 게 보였다. 이미 유치원에서 수제 햄버거 때문에 일어난 소동은 모두 알 터였다. 나는 최대한 천천히 음식을 먹었다. 괜히 엄마가 있는 자리에서 그런 소리를 다시 듣기는 싫었다. 철의 여인이 엄마에게 하는 이야기가 들렸다. “성국이 아버지는 보쌈집 하신다고요?” “네, 아파트 상가에서 조그맣게 하고 있어요.” 그 말에 원생들 엄마들은 모두 놀란 눈치였다. 그러곤 서로 눈짓을 주고받으며 속삭였다. 철의 여인은 엄마에게 마카롱을 건넸다. “커피랑 드시면 맛있어요. 제가 파리에서 좋아하던 건데, 이번에 들어올 때 많이 사왔어요. 파리 가봤죠?” “아니요. 저는 태어나서 외국 나가본 적이 없어요. 제주도도 아직 못 가봤어요.” 그 말에 엄마들의 눈짓은 더 빨라졌다. 철의 여인은 모든 것을 알고 있는데, 일부러 엄마를 불러 질문을 하고 있었다. 나는 손을 앙 쥐었다. [감히 우리 엄마를 건드려?!]","completion":"Episode 32 Mom took a few more sips of beer. \\"Soyoung, calm down.\\" \\"I'm just so upset. I feel like I'm not enough for such a smart kid.\\" [Mom, to me, any parent would be lacking. How can I deal with being too perfect?] I shrugged my shoulders. Dad looked at his watch. It was already past 9:30. \\"Soyoung, I'll start cleaning up. I have the news on for Sungkook. Just drink a little beer.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Mom turned on the news for me. It was about Samsung Group considering several locations in Gyeonggi-do for a new semiconductor plant site. [It's Dongtan. Next will be Pyeongtaek below Dongtan.] I looked at my short, chubby hands. [If I were just 10 years older, I'd buy land there...] Mom looked at me while drinking her beer. Her face seemed more relaxed than before, thanks to the beer. \\"Sungkook, do you find the news interesting?\\" \\"Yes, Mom.\\" I called out to Mom energetically. \\"Why?\\" \\"Dongtan.\\" [Ah, should I have said Hwaseong?] \\"Dongtan? What's that?\\" \\"Mom.\\" \\"Sungkook is looking for Mom a lot today. Why?\\" \\"Land.\\" I cheerfully told Mom. \\"Land? Why?\\" \\"Want to buy land.\\" \\"You want to buy land?\\" Dad, who was just finishing up in the kitchen, suddenly stopped. \\"Soyoung, did Sungkook just say he wants to buy land?\\" \\"It seems so...\\" [I do want to buy land! I know all the lands Samsung Group is moving to. Anywhere near there would be a jackpot, Mom. Dad!] I muttered, but being five years old had its limits after all. Dad quickly picked me up. Dad's face was now cheerful, unlike before. \\"Soyoung, while I was cleaning the kitchen, I thought about it. It seems Sungkook really is a genius.\\" [Of course.] \\"I understand you're surprised, but I think we can really raise Sungkook well.\\" \\"Brother, what are you talking about? We only graduated high school.\\" \\"That's the point. If we were more educated, we might not have let Sungkook study freely. We always turned on the news he liked, bought him any books he wanted to read. Maybe that was actually good education. We let him freely explore what he wanted to do.\\" \\"Is that so...\\" Mom seemed unconvinced. I wasn't very confident in Dad's hypothesis either. My vast knowledge and abilities were actually born from the harsh Spartan education of Samsung Group. Of course, it would have been impossible without my brilliant mind. But indeed, in this life, having parents with a bit shorter educational background did help. Where else would you find parents who would buy their five-year-old <Mankiw's Economics>? I snuggled into Dad's embrace. Normally, I would have struggled, taken a boxing stance, and asked to play, but today Dad seemed admirable. [This is a bonus.] I even kissed Dad on the cheek. Dad's lips seemed to ascend to heaven. \\"See? Sungkook agrees with me.\\" \\"Maybe... But still, we can't just buy him land because Sungkook asks.\\" [Mom, I'll buy it with my own money!] \\"If Sungkook uses his own money to buy it, we can't stop him.\\" [Right! Dad, you're somewhat helpful today.] I quickly gave Dad another peck. \\"Soyoung, but really, if Sungkook is a genius, shouldn't we take him to some institution for an IQ test or something? I heard on TV these days they start special education for geniuses from an early age.\\" \\"I'll consult with Miyoung and look into it.\\" \\"Soyoung, isn't it amazing?\\" \\"What is?\\" \\"How did a genius like this get born from you and me?\\" [My point exactly.] I shrugged my shoulders. Dad looked at Minkook, who was sleeping in the stroller. \\"Soyoung, could Minkook also be a genius?\\" [Dad! That's not it!] * * * [Huh, this is a piece of cake.] The IQ test paper was in front of me. After learning that I had learned English just by watching TV and could converse fluently with Thomas, a native English teacher, Mr. Yang, the secretary, recommended my parents to have me take a genius test. On a day off from kindergarten, I came to the institution with Mom and Manager Kim Miyoung to take the genius test. The genius test wasn't particularly difficult. At first, the evaluator observed and assessed my way of thinking, my ability to interpret text, and how I mingled with other children in a normal manner. After various evaluations, it was finally time for the IQ test. I quickly finished the test and raised my hand to Mom. \\"Done!\\" The staff quickly came in and collected the test paper. \\"Mr. Yang requested that we get the results immediately. Please wait a moment.\\" [I know the result without even looking. I had an IQ of 167 in my previous life. Did that IQ fly to the sky or sink into the ground?] I shrugged my shoulders. * * * \\"Today, observing Sungkook's behavior and learning ability, it was astonishing. Everyone was saying, isn't he a genius?\\" A woman with long hair lifted high at the front explained about me. Mom looked slightly anxious. I firmly held Mom's hand. [Mom, your son is indeed a genius.] \\"But you know.\\" [Uh, what's that? If there's a 'but' after a good story, it means there's a twist...] The woman pushed the test paper forward. The paper had various scores and graphs drawn on it. Learning ability, cognition, and thinking ability were all off the charts, as if they were about to break through the graph. But... \\"His IQ is too ordinary. For a child like him, it should be at least 130 or above. But Sungkook's is 121.\\" [What, what? Wait, what did you just say? My IQ is 121?] I was so shocked that I stared at the woman again. [Repeat that, you're joking, right? I, in my previous life, had an IQ of 167 and was a member of Mensa!] Kim Miyoung also looked puzzled. \\"Teacher, is it possible to have such a good score in everything else but a bad IQ?\\" \\"121 isn't bad. It's above average. However, considering Sungkook's learning ability and everything else is at the top 0.1%, it's just that his IQ seems ordinary in comparison.\\" [I can't believe it.] I quickly pulled the test paper towards me. But indeed, the IQ was 121. What on earth happened? The woman patted my head. \\"Acting like this at five years old is unbelievable. It seems Sungkook might have tricked the IQ test. It's a common occurrence among exceptionally smart children.\\" \\"Is that so?\\" Mom finally relaxed. But on the contrary, I was in despair. [I actually... tried my hardest. I did the IQ test with all my might...] My shoulders slumped. The teacher showed various indicators to Mom and Manager Kim Miyoung and explained. \\"Sungkook is truly unparalleled in other areas. Honestly, his comprehension and vocabulary are superior to many adults, which surprised me too.\\" I couldn't hear anything anymore. [My IQ is 121? Ordinary? Did they only give me a face this time and not a brain?] \\"Sungkook, shall we go to the next schedule?\\" [I decided not to work, what schedule?] \\"Are you in the same class as Jeon Mijin?\\" Manager Kim Miyoung asked. \\"Yes.\\" I answered weakly. \\"Mr. Yang said Mijin invited you to her birthday, is that right?\\" [Ah, I forgot. That's how unimportant it is. I don't want to go.] I got up from the chair, put my hands behind my back, and walked out. \\"Mijin also invited Mom and me...\\" [It wasn't Jeon Mijin who invited, but Mr. Yang who told us to come.] I stopped for a moment and pondered. Jeon Mijin was indeed a very disliked younger sister, of course, in my previous life. I didn't want to get involved with her in this life either. But I knew Jeon Mijin's weakness better than anyone. She was a fool for love. Moreover, she was the type to give her liver and gallbladder to someone she liked. Anyway, Jeon Mijin was currently at the top of the pyramid at Samsung Kindergarten. As someone representing the \\"dirt spoon\\" in Samsung Kindergarten, it wouldn't hurt to make a good impression. I finally gathered my energy and walked towards Mom. \\"Mom. We need to buy a gift.\\" \\"Alright, let's stop by the department store on the way and buy a gift. But what could a rich girl's daughter possibly lack?\\" [Don't worry. I know.] I was the first to burst out the door. * * * \\"Do you want to buy flowers, Sungkook?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I looked around the flower shop and chose pink roses. I've never seen a girl who hates roses or pink. Jeon Mijin wouldn't be an exception. Kim Miyoung paid for all the pink roses in the shop. \\"Sister, do we need to buy anything else?\\" \\"I don't know what else to buy. I'm not even married.\\" \\"Me neither, I don't have a daughter...\\" [Me bringing flowers is the gift itself.] And Jeon Mijin, who received the flowers I offered, smiled as if her mouth was going to tear. \\"Wow, so pretty.\\" \\"Happy birthday, Mijin.\\" \\"Thank you so much, Sungkook. Come here.\\" Jeon Mijin took my hand and led me to a separate house located in Hannam-dong. The separate house was mainly used by Dad to entertain guests at home, but it was also used for the children's birthday parties or Mom's gatherings. In a corner, all the A-class students of Samsung Kindergarten and their mothers were sitting. There were a few familiar faces. The grandson of the Attorney General, Kim Jusung's mother, was a cousin of Samsung Group's Chairman Jeon Jaehyung. It was a family that managed one of the affiliates independently. The granddaughter of Samsung Hospital's director, Lee Sehee's mother, was once a famous singer. All were people connected by one or two degrees. Jeon Mijin hugged the bouquet of pink roses and bragged to the Iron Lady. \\"Mom, Sungkook bought it.\\" \\"Very thoughtful.\\" The Iron Lady glanced at me once and then at Mom. [Why is she looking like that? Could it be...] The Iron Lady pointed to the seat next to her and called Mom. \\"Sungkook's mom, sit here.\\" \\"Ah, yes.\\" Mom sat right next to the Iron Lady. [Hmm... I'm uneasy.] The Iron Lady, though outwardly elegant, actually strictly divided people into classes and distinguished between those she would speak to and those she wouldn't. But calling Mom to sit next to her... something didn't sit right with me. I naturally sat next to Jeon Mijin, which also put me very close to the Iron Lady. It was the perfect position to monitor the conversation between the Iron Lady and Mom. Jeon Mijin offered me cake first, food first, and drinks first. \\"Sungkook, eat this.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Everyone seemed to be watching me. The commotion caused by the homemade hamburger at the kindergarten was well known to all. I ate the food as slowly as possible. I didn't want to hear such comments in front of Mom again. I could hear the Iron Lady talking to Mom. \\"Sungkook's father runs a pork wrap restaurant?\\" \\"Yes, he runs a small place in an apartment complex.\\" At that, the mothers of the students all seemed surprised. Then they exchanged glances and whispered to each other. The Iron Lady offered Mom a macaron. \\"It's delicious with coffee. I liked it in Paris, so I bought a lot when I came in this time. You've been to Paris, right?\\" \\"No. I've never been abroad in my life. I haven't even been to Jeju Island.\\" At that, the mothers' glances became even quicker. The Iron Lady knew everything but deliberately called Mom to ask questions. I clenched my fists. [How dare you touch my mom?!]"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[겨우, 떨궜네.] “성국아.” [하아, 한 명 가니 한 명 오는 건가.] 전미진이 뒤에서 몸을 배배 꼬고 있었다. [너 오줌 마렵니?] “성국아, 이거.” 전미진은 내 앞에 화려한 장식이 된 카드를 내밀었다. “이게 뭐야?” “내 생일 파티 초대장. 올 거지?” “생각해볼게.” “앙 돼!” 전미진은 갑자기 화를 버럭 냈다. [어릴 때부터 성격 지랄맞았구나. 네 마음대로 안 된다고 소리 지르고 하니까 언론에도 오르내리는 거 아니야!] “성구기, 꼭 와. 어?” 이번엔 갑자기 내 팔을 잡고 늘어졌다. 나는 얼른 전미진의 팔을 뿌리쳤다. [가족끼리 이러는 거 아니야.] 전미진은 곧 울듯이 나를 원망 어린 눈으로 쳐다봤다. [어쩔 수 없네.] “갈게.” “진따?” “응.” 나는 되도록 짧게 대답했다. 이지은 선생님이 아이들을 불렀다. “자, 이제 점심시간이에요. 자리로 돌아가세요.” 전미진이 바로 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 밥 가치 먹자.” [난 혼자만의 시간이 필요하다고.] 나는 이번엔 최대한 슬쩍 전미진의 손을 빼고 먼저 달려갔다. 전미진은 득달같이 달려와 내 옆자리에 앉았다. “미진아, 거기 미진이 자리 아니잖아요.” “여기서 먹을래요!” 전미진은 또 고집을 부렸다. 이지은 선생님도 포기한 눈치였다. “오늘만이에요.” “싫어요. 성국이 옆자리는 이제 미진이 자리에요.” [갈수록 태산이네.] 다른 남자아이들은 고집쟁이 전미진이 내 곁에 찰싹 붙은 게 오히려 다행이란 눈치였다. [말이 통해야 설득이라도 하지.] 다섯 살짜리 아이에게 말이 통할 리가 없었다. 곧 문이 열리더니 요리사 복장을 한 남자가 여섯 개의 수제 햄버거를 들고 들어왔다. 특별반의 식사는 일반반과는 천지 차이였다. 영양가 골고루 짜인 한식을 주식으로 일주일에 이틀 정도 특식이 나왔다. 오늘이 그날인 모양이었다. 내 앞에도 딱 봐도 육즙 가득 머금은 패티를 품은 수제 햄버거가 놓였다. [이게 얼마 만이야.] 나는 얼른 손을 걷어 올리고, 수제 햄버거를 양손으로 잡았다. 그리고 입을 최대한 크게 벌려 한 입 깨물었다. [바로, 이 맛이야! 근데… 왜 옆얼굴이 이렇게 따갑지?] 고개를 돌리자, 전미진이 햄버거는 먹지도 않고 턱을 두 손으로 괸 채 나를 바라보고 있는 게 아닌가. 나는 어이가 없었지만, 우선 무시하고 햄버거에 집중했다. “미진아, 햄버거 먹어야지요. 선생님이 잘라줄까?” “네. 너무 커요.” [네 입이 햄버거보다 더 커.] 나는 속으로 혀를 끌끌 차며 햄버거를 계속 먹어댔다. 하나를 다 먹고 나서도 살짝 아쉬운 감이 들었다. “성국아, 햄버거 하나 더 먹을래요?” “녜에!” 이지은 선생님의 물음에 나는 크게 대답했다. 이지은 선생님은 기분 좋게 여유분의 햄버거를 꺼내 내 접시 위에 올렸다. “성국아, 천천히 먹어야 해요.” “천천히!” 나는 선생님의 말에 따라 이번엔 천천히 햄버거를 한 입 한 입 먹었다. 이때, 뒤통수에서 강주성의 목소리가 들렸다. “햄버거도 못 먹어봤나 봐.” “거지 같아.” 뒤이어 김현중이 말을 보탰다. 나는 강주성과 김현중을 쏘아봤다. [지금, 거지 같다고 말했냐?] 나는 햄버거를 접시 위에 내려놓고 냅킨으로 최대한 우아하게 입을 닦았다. 겨우 다섯 살짜리들과 똑같이 복수를 해줄 수 없는 법이다. 나는 팔뚝을 살짝 걷어 올렸다. 내가 강주성과 김현중에게 내 주먹맛을 보여준다면, 아마 우리 엄마, 아빠는 또다시 걷잡을 수 없는 나락으로 떨어질지 모른다. 겨우 변호사나 하는 집안 자식들도 심심하면 소송을 해대는 게 이 나라의 소위 잘사는 집 사람들이었다. 특히나 지금은 1995년이다. 우리나라가 1988년 서울 올림픽을 치르고 7년이 갓 지난 시점이었다. 문민정부가 들어섰지만, 성수대교가 무너지고 삼풍백화점이 무너졌다. 대한민국은 아직도 곳곳에 비리와 잘못된 행정으로 몸살을 앓고 있다. 이런 시국에 결국, 가장 불쌍한 것은 나와 같은 서민이었다. 나는 팔뚝을 마지막까지 야무지게 걷고, 일어나려는데. 짜악-. 짜악- 찰진 소리가 들렸다. 뭐지? 전미진이 강주성과 김현중의 뺨을 아주 찰지게 때리고 있었다. [어릴 때부터 싹수가 보였네.] 전미진의 저 싸대기는 나중에 커서는 아주 유명해진다. 전미진이 운영하는 패션 브랜드의 여직원 한 명이 전미진이 주문한 귀리 우유가 들어간 라떼 대신에 일반 우유가 들어간 라떼를 사와 화가 난 전미진은 그 여직원의 싸대기를 저렇게 시원하게 날렸다. 한 가지를 보면 열 가지를 안다고, 이 일만 있었던 것은 아니었다. 평소에 불만을 가진 직원 누군가가 이 장면을 몰래 찍었고, 이 일로 카메라 앞에서 대국민 사과까지 하며 집안 망신을 톡톡히 시켰다. 하지만 지금 전미진은 나 대신 복수를 한 거였다. 전미진에게 뺨을 제대로 맞은 강주성과 김현중은 얼얼한 뺨을 부여잡고는 억울한 눈빛으로 전미진을 쳐다봤다. “왜 때려?” 검찰총장 손자 강주성이 호기를 부려봤다. 겨우 삼전 전자의 대표 손주인 김현중은 알아서 찌그러져 있었다. 전미진은 가소롭다는 듯이 강주성을 쳐다보며 팔을 걷어 올렸다. “니네 지금 성국이한테 뭐라고 했어?” “…….” 강주성은 입을 꾹 다물었다. 아무리 검찰총장 자식이라고 해도 대한민국 모든 체계 위에 존재하는 것이 삼전 그룹이었다. 이지은 선생님도 이 상황을 지켜볼 수밖에 없었다. 자신이 해야 할 일은 아이들을 잘 지도, 관찰하는 것이지 혼낼 권한도 없었다. 이지은 선생님은 그래도 중재에 나섰다. “미진아, 교실에서 폭력은 안 돼요.” “선생님.” 전미진은 앙칼진 목소리로 이지은 선생님을 불렀다. 이지은 선생님은 어쩔 줄 몰라 하는 눈치였다. “저희 어머니한테 좀 연락해 주세요.” “그건 왜요?” “어머니한테 말씀드릴 거예요.” 전미진은 똑 부러지게 말했다. [제법인걸.] 나는 몰랐던 전미진의 모습을 보며 걷어 올린 팔뚝을 슬슬 내렸다. 강주성과 김현중은 나를 원망 어린 시선으로 쳐다볼 뿐이었다. 이지은 선생님은 얼른 미진이를 안고 아이들을 바라봤다. “미진아, 어머니께는 이따 연락드리고 우선 친구들이랑 화해해야죠. 주성과 현중아, 미진이한테 사과해야죠.” 맞은 사람이 때린 사람에게 사과하는 어이없는 상황이 눈앞에서 펼쳐지고 있었다. 삼전 그룹 유치원 특별반. 이곳은 그런 곳이었다. 자신의 부모가 곧 서열이 되고, 우정에도 서열이 존재하는 곳. 그리고 아무도 이 서열을 부정하지 않았다. 왜냐하면 이들은 자라서 어쨌든 대한민국 정재계를 흔들 존재들이기 때문이다. 나는 흥미롭게 이 정글을 바라봤다. 강주성과 김현중은 체념한 얼굴로 전미진에게 사과를 했다. “미안해.” “나두 미안해.” “그래, 용서해줄게. 성국이한테 다시는 그러지 마.” 전미진은 페르시아의 여왕처럼 강주성과 김현중에게 자비를 베풀었다. 이 특별반의 서열이 한눈에 보였다. 전미진은 피라미드 제일 꼭대기. 그 아래로 국방부 장관과 검찰총장 할아버지를 둔 서여림과 강주성. 그 아래는 삼전 그룹의 계열사로 분류되는 전자의 대표와 병원의 병원장 손자와 손녀인 김현중과 이세희. 그럼, 내 위치는 어디일까? 나는 지금 저 피라미드 어디에도 속하지 못하는 존재였다. 비록 다섯 살이었지만, 이제 나도 결정을 해야 하는 타이밍이 왔다. 저 거대한 피라미드 속으로 들어갈 것인지. 아니면 나만의 피라미드를 만들 것인지. 나는 손을 앙 쥐었다. * * * 그날 저녁, 집으로 한 통의 전화가 걸려왔다. 바로 삼전 유치원의 이지은 선생님이었다. 저녁을 먹고, 아빠 가게에 막 놀러 가려는 참이었다. 엄마는 전화를 받는 내내 나에게서 눈을 떼지 못했다. 간간이 이런 이야기가 들렸다. “우리 성국이가요? 진짜요? …혼자 한글을 깨친 건 알았는데, 그것까진 몰랐어요.” 아무래도 오늘 내가 토마스와 프리토킹을 한 것에 놀란 이지은 선생님이 진실을 알기 위해 전화를 건 모양이었다. 엄마는 전화를 끊고, 민국이를 유모차에 태웠다. 그러고는 평소처럼 최대한 차분히 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 아빠 보러 가자.” “녜에!” 나는 현관 턱에 주저앉아서 운동화도 혼자 신었다. 엄마는 나를 물끄러미 바라봤다. 내가 일어서면서 휘청하자, 엄마가 얼른 나를 잡아 세웠다. “성국아, 괜찮아?” “녜에, 엄마.” 엄마는 내 손을 꼭 잡았다. 우리는 아파트 상가에 있는 아빠의 가게로 향했다. 평소 같으면 이런저런 말을 걸던 엄마가 너무나 조용했다. 나는 엄마의 손을 살짝 잡아당겨도 봤지만, 엄마는 무슨 생각에 빠진 듯 그럴 때마다 나를 보며 웃을 뿐이었다. [엄마, 무섭게 왜 이래.] 다섯 살 인생 평생 처음 본 엄마의 모습에 살짝 긴장이 됐다. 딸랑. 가게 문을 열자 종소리가 울렸다. 주방에서 아빠가 얼굴을 내밀었다. “오늘도 마중 나온 거야?” “자기야, 오늘은 어땠어?” “조금씩 느는 중이야.” 이때, 배달 기사분이 들어오시더니 아빠가 포장해둔 봉투를 들고 휭하니 나갔다. 엄마는 빈자리에 앉았다. 평일이라 그런지 다른 손님은 없었다. 엄마는 나를 의자에 앉히더니 물끄러미 바라봤다. [엄마, 자꾸 왜 그렇게 날 보는 거야?] “성국아, 물 줄까?” “물.” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. 엄마는 물 잔을 앞에 두더니 갑자기 냉장고에서 맥주를 꺼내서 들고 왔다. 그리고 주방에다 대고 소리쳤다. “자기야, 나 맥주 한 병 해도 돼?” “맥주 땡겨?” “응. 자기도 시간 되면 잠시 앉아봐. 할 말 있어.” “이것만 하고.” 아빠는 포장된 보쌈을 카운터에 놓고 엄마 앞에 앉았다. 시간은 9시가 넘어가고 있었다. 엄마는 혼자 맥주를 벌컥벌컥 마시더니 아빠를 바라봤다. “소영아, 무슨 일 있어? 회사에서 뭐 안 좋은 일 있었어?” “그게 아니라….” “그럼, 뭔데?” “자기야, 우리는 성국이 부모 자격이 없는 것 같아.” [엄마, 뭐라는 거야?] 나는 미간을 팍 구겼다. “소영아, 그게 소리야?” “좀 전에 성국이 유치원 선생님한테 전화가 왔어. 근데… 성국이가 영어를 엄청 잘한다는 거야.” “어?” 아빠도 놀란 눈치였다. 나는 시치미를 뚝 떼고 앉아 있었다. “영어 시간이 있는데, 그 반 아이들은 모두 외국에서 살다 오거나 해서 영어를 잘해서 성국이를 좀 걱정했는데. 오히려 다른 애들보다 영어를 더 잘하더래.” [엄마, 나 사실은 중국어, 일어, 독일어, 프랑스어도 해.] “선생님은 뭐래?” “수업 끝나고 성국이한테 영어 어디서 배웠냐고 하니까, TV 보고 배웠다고 했대.” 아빠는 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. [아빠, 입 닫아. 파리 들어가.] 나는 두 사람의 눈치를 보며 물을 쪽 마셨다. “소영아… 그게 가능한 일이야?” “나도 그걸 몰라서…. 자기야, 우리가 성국이를 키울 자격이 없는 것 같아. 애가 혼자 영어를 깨치는데도, 부모가 돼서 몰랐잖아.” [그건 내가 말을 안 해서 몰랐던 거지. 저번 생에서 배워왔단 말을 어떻게 하냐고, 이 어린 부모들아.] 나는 고개를 도리도리 흔들었다.","completion":"Episode 31 After English class, it was soon time for physical training and personal reading time. I skimmed through books, but none seemed appealing. Teacher Lee Ji-eun approached me. \\"Sung-guk, can't find any book you like?\\" \\"Teacher, can I bring a book from home?\\" \\"Of course. Just not a weird book.\\" \\"Yess!\\" I casually responded and randomly picked any children's book I could grab. Teacher Lee Ji-eun stayed by my side. She seemed to have something she wanted to ask. \\"Sung-guk, have you ever learned English?\\" \\"Watching TV.\\" \\"You learned from watching TV?\\" \\"Yess.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yess.\\" I gave the prepared answer. Teacher Lee Ji-eun seemed slightly surprised but also somewhat skeptical of my words. After patting my head twice, she moved next to Lee Se-hee. [Phew, dodged that.] \\"Sung-guk.\\" [Sigh, one leaves and another comes.] Jeon Mi-jin was twisting her body behind me. [Do you need to pee?] \\"Sung-guk, this.\\" Jeon Mi-jin handed me a card decorated lavishly. \\"What's this?\\" \\"My birthday party invitation. You'll come, right?\\" \\"I'll think about it.\\" \\"No way!\\" Jeon Mi-jin suddenly burst out in anger. [You've had a nasty temper since you were young. Screaming when things don't go your way, no wonder you're all over the media!] \\"Sung-guk, you must come. Okay?\\" This time, she suddenly grabbed my arm and pleaded. I quickly shook off Jeon Mi-jin's arm. [We're not family to be doing this.] Jeon Mi-jin then looked at me with resentful eyes. [No choice.] \\"I'll go.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I answered as briefly as possible. Teacher Lee Ji-eun called the children. \\"Okay, it's lunchtime now. Please return to your seats.\\" Jeon Mi-jin immediately grabbed my hand. \\"Sung-guk, let's go eat together.\\" [I need some alone time.] This time, I gently slipped my hand away from Jeon Mi-jin and ran ahead. Jeon Mi-jin rushed to sit next to me. \\"Mi-jin, that's not your seat.\\" \\"I want to eat here!\\" Jeon Mi-jin was stubborn again. Teacher Lee Ji-eun seemed to give up. \\"Only for today.\\" \\"No. From now on, the seat next to Sung-guk is mine.\\" [It's getting out of hand.] The other boys seemed relieved that the stubborn Jeon Mi-jin was sticking to me. [Talking would at least allow for persuasion.] It was impossible to reason with a five-year-old. Soon, a man dressed as a chef entered with six homemade burgers. The special class's meals were worlds apart from the regular class. Nutritionally balanced Korean meals were the staple, with special meals twice a week. Today seemed to be one of those days. A homemade burger, clearly juicy, was placed in front of me. [It's been so long.] I quickly rolled up my sleeves, grabbed the burger with both hands, and took a big bite. [This is the taste! But... why does my cheek feel so hot?] Turning my head, I saw Jeon Mi-jin not eating her burger but resting her chin on her hands, staring at me. I was dumbfounded but focused on my burger first. \\"Mi-jin, you should eat your burger. Want me to cut it for you?\\" \\"Yes. It's too big.\\" [Your mouth is bigger than the burger.] I silently criticized and continued eating my burger. I felt slightly unsatisfied even after finishing one. \\"Sung-guk, want another burger?\\" \\"Yess!\\" I responded loudly to Teacher Lee Ji-eun's question. Teacher Lee Ji-eun happily placed an extra burger on my plate. \\"Sung-guk, you should eat slowly.\\" \\"Slowly!\\" Following the teacher's advice, I slowly ate the burger bite by bite. Then, I heard Kang Ju-seong's voice from behind. \\"Never had a burger before?\\" \\"Pathetic.\\" Kim Hyun-jung added his comment. I glared at Kang Ju-seong and Kim Hyun-jung. [Did you just call me pathetic?] I put down the burger and elegantly wiped my mouth with a napkin. I couldn't stoop to the level of five-year-olds for revenge. I slightly rolled up my sleeves. If I showed Kang Ju-seong and Kim Hyun-jung what my fists could do, my parents might fall into an uncontrollable abyss again. Children from families that occasionally sue were the so-called well-off in this country. Especially since it was 1995. It had been just 7 years since the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Even though a civilian government was in place, the Seongsu Bridge and Sampoong Department Store had collapsed. South Korea was still suffering from corruption and administrative errors. In such times, the most pitiful were commoners like me. I was about to roll up my sleeves when suddenly - Slap-. Slap- I heard crisp sounds. What's that? Jeon Mi-jin was slapping Kang Ju-seong and Kim Hyun-jung's cheeks quite crisply. [She showed her true colors early on.] Jeon Mi-jin's slap would become famous later on. When a female employee of Jeon Mi-jin's fashion brand brought a latte with regular milk instead of the ordered oat milk, an angry Jeon Mi-jin slapped her crisply like that. It wasn't the only incident. A disgruntled employee secretly filmed the scene, leading to a public apology on camera, bringing shame to the family. But now, Jeon Mi-jin was avenging me. Kang Ju-seong and Kim Hyun-jung, having been slapped properly by Jeon Mi-jin, looked at her with resentful eyes. \\"Why did you hit me?\\" Prosecutor General's grandson Kang Ju-seong tried to act tough. Kim Hyun-jung, the grandson of the Samsung Group's executive, just shrank back. Jeon Mi-jin looked at Kang Ju-seong with disdain and rolled up her sleeves. \\"What did you say to Sung-guk?\\" \\"...\\" Kang Ju-seong clamped his mouth shut. Even the Prosecutor General's child couldn't stand above Samsung Group in South Korea. Teacher Lee Ji-eun had no choice but to watch. Her job was to guide and observe the children, not to scold them. Still, she attempted to mediate. \\"Mi-jin, violence isn't allowed in the classroom.\\" \\"Teacher.\\" Jeon Mi-jin called Teacher Lee Ji-eun with a sharp voice. Teacher Lee Ji-eun looked unsure of what to do. \\"Please contact my mother.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"I'll tell her.\\" Jeon Mi-jin spoke decisively. [That's the way.] Seeing a side of Jeon Mi-jin I didn't know, I slowly lowered my rolled-up sleeves. Kang Ju-seong and Kim Hyun-jung could only look at me with resentful eyes. Teacher Lee Ji-eun quickly hugged Mi-jin and looked at the children. \\"Mi-jin, you should reconcile with your friends first. Ju-seong, Hyun-jung, apologize to Mi-jin.\\" The absurd situation of the victim apologizing to the aggressor unfolded before my eyes. Samsung Group Kindergarten special class. This was such a place. Your parents' status determined your rank, and even friendships had hierarchies. And no one questioned this hierarchy. Because, after all, these children would shake up South Korea's political and business worlds. I watched this jungle with interest. Kang Ju-seong and Kim Hyun-jung reluctantly apologized to Jeon Mi-jin. \\"Sorry.\\" \\"Me too, sorry.\\" \\"Okay, I forgive you. Don't do that to Sung-guk again.\\" Jeon Mi-jin, like the queen of Persia, bestowed mercy on Kang Ju-seong and Kim Hyun-jung. The hierarchy of this special class was clear at a glance. Jeon Mi-jin at the very top of the pyramid. Below her, the grandchildren of the Minister of National Defense and the Prosecutor General, Seo Ye-rim and Kang Ju-seong. Below them were the grandchildren of the Samsung Group's executive and the hospital director, Kim Hyun-jung and Lee Se-hee. So, where was my place? I was a being that didn't belong anywhere in this pyramid. Although I was only five, the time had come for me to make a decision. Whether to enter this giant pyramid. Or to build my own pyramid. I clenched my fists. * * * That evening, a call came to our house. It was Teacher Lee Ji-eun from Samsung Kindergarten. I was about to go play at Dad's shop after dinner. Mom couldn't take her eyes off me while on the phone. I overheard bits of the conversation. \\"Our Sung-guk? Really? ...I knew he learned Hangul on his own, but I didn't know about that.\\" Apparently, Teacher Lee Ji-eun, surprised by my freetalking with Thomas today, called to find out the truth. After hanging up, Mom put Min-guk in the stroller. Then, as usual, she looked at me as calmly as possible. \\"Sung-guk, let's go see Dad.\\" \\"Yess!\\" I sat down at the entrance and put on my sneakers by myself. Mom watched me intently. When I stood up and wobbled, Mom quickly steadied me. \\"Sung-guk, are you okay?\\" \\"Yess, Mom.\\" Mom held my hand tightly. We headed to Dad's shop in the apartment complex. Normally, Mom would start a conversation, but she was unusually quiet today. I tried pulling on Mom's hand, but she just smiled at me each time. [Mom, why are you being so scary?] This was the first time in my five-year life that I saw Mom like this. Ding-dong. The shop door opened, ringing the bell. Dad peeked out from the kitchen. \\"Did you come to meet me again today?\\" \\"How was today, honey?\\" \\"It's slowly increasing.\\" Then, a delivery man entered, took the packaged bossam prepared by Dad, and left swiftly. Mom sat down in an empty seat. It was a weekday, so there were no other customers. Mom placed me on a chair and looked at me intently. [Mom, why do you keep looking at me like that?] \\"Sung-guk, want some water?\\" \\"Water.\\" I nodded. Mom placed a glass of water in front of me and suddenly took out a beer from the fridge.

And... Sung-guk is really good at English.\\" \\"What?\\" Dad looked surprised too. I pretended to be oblivious. \\"There's an English class, and since all the kids in that class have lived abroad or something, they were worried about Sung-guk. But it turns out he's even better than the other kids.\\" [Mom, actually, I can also speak Chinese, Japanese, German, and French.] \\"What did the teacher say?\\" \\"She asked Sung-guk where he learned English, and he said from watching TV.\\" Dad looked at me in astonishment. [Dad, close your mouth. A fly might get in.] I glanced at them and sipped my water. \\"So-young... Is that even possible?\\" \\"I don't know either... Honey, I think we're not qualified to raise Sung-guk. He figured out English on his own, and we, as parents, didn't even know.\\" [It's because I didn't tell you.

Three AA batteries in series would hence provide 4.5 volts total (1.5 volts * 3). 3. **Battery Capacity**: The capacity of AA batteries can vary quite a bit depending on the brand and chemistry (e.g., alkaline, lithium), usually ranging from about 1200 mAh to 3000 mAh for alkaline and even higher for lithium. For this estimation, I'll assume we're working with alkaline batteries and use a middle ground capacity of about 2000 mAh (or 2 Ah) per battery. Given this device needs 4 volts and 1 amp (or 1000 mA) to operate, and assuming some form of regulator is used to step down the voltage from 4.5 volts from the batteries to the required 4 volts efficiently (without significant loss), we can proceed with the calculation using the 1 amp current draw. **Calculation**: [ text{Battery Life (hours)} = frac{text{Battery Capacity (Ah)}}{text{Current Draw (A)}} ] Using the assumed 2000 mAh (or 2 Ah) capacity: [ text{Battery Life} = frac{2 , text{Ah}}{1 , text{A}} = 2 , text{hours} ] So, with the assumptions made, three AA batteries could theoretically power the device for approximately 2 hours. This estimation assumes ideal conditions; real-world performance can vary due to factors like battery degradation, device efficiency, and the efficiency of the voltage regulation mechanism used to maintain the required operational voltage."},{"prompt":"Почему люди не используют активно экзоскелеты для инвалидов, как парализованных, так и для тех, у кого просто имеются проблемы с передвижением, но сама функция движения есть? Или экзоскелеты - фантастика, у которой нет шансов на успех? В чём проблемы, если уже существуют какие-то прототипы и нароботки? Чего-то не хватает?","completion":"Один из основных причин, по которой люди не активно используют экзоскелеты для инвалидов, заключается в их дороговизне. Экзоскелеты являются довольно дорогостоящими устройствами, и не каждый инвалид может себе их позволить. Кроме того, существует ряд технических ограничений, таких как ограниченное время работы от батарей, сложность управления и настройки устройства, и необходимость постоянной поддержки и обслуживания. Также, существует медицинские ограничения: не все инвалиды могут воспользоваться экзоскелетами из-за своего состояния здоровья или других противопоказаний. Несмотря на это, существуют определенные прототипы и наработки экзоскелетов, которые успехом применяются в реабилитации и помогают инвалидам улучшить свою жизнь.

Suddenly, a flying, ghost bull streaks across the sky, forcing the Mystery Machine to swerve off the road and drive through the desert. They eventually lose the bull and arrive at the ranch, telling Uncle Matt about the ghost bull. A local rancher, Sam Farren declares that many cattle have gone missing from the ranch. Uncle Matt tells about a flying bull named Tamuka that guards the burial grounds of an ancient cliff-dwelling tribe. Scooby and Shaggy are spooked by a ghostly sheet, but realize it is only the ranch's cook, Lenny. A car pulls up and a ranch foreman informs everybody that more cattle have gone missing. Shaggy, Scooby and Uncle Matt head off to the Sheriff's station, while Velma, Daphne and Fred decide to investigate the pasture where the cows went missing. While driving for town, Shaggy, Scooby and Uncle Matt drive through a tunnel in a cliff and when they exit, Uncle Matt is gone! Calling for him, they receive no response so Shaggy gets at the wheel and turn around to return to the ranch and tell the others. Fred and the girls find the fence was cut open with wire cutters and there are no tracks anywhere. The ghost bull arrives and the threesome flee. Shaggy and Scooby also encounter the ghost bull and races back to the ranch, which is deserted. Shaggy and Scooby go looking and after a close call with a REAL mad bull in the barn, Fred, Daphne and Velma arrive and Shaggy and Scooby hurriedly inform the gang about Uncle Matt. So, the five decide to venture into the desert to where they first saw the flying bull, much to Scooby and Shaggy's chagrin. A little ways out on the dirt road, the gang find tire tracks and follow them to an Indian burial ground built into a cliff. They follow another set of tire tracks to a hidden pasture full of the stolen cows. But a ranch foreman arrives and tells them to scat and not to trespass, as they mistakenly happened upon Sam Farren's ranch. So they head back to the burial grounds. Fred, Daphne and Velma enter while Shaggy and Scooby, scared as they are, stand guard. Inside, Velma loses her glasses and while looking, they stumble upon a skeleton. Back outside, a ghostly Indian appears at the top of a ledge on the burial grounds, performing a ritual dance. Shaggy and Scooby run inside and tell the gang as the skeleton crumbles into pieces. Tamuka appears inside and the gang flee into the burial grounds and get separated. Shag and Scoob run into the Indian ghost and they hide, prompting the Indian ghost to give up and retreat, while Velma, Fred and Daphne get sealed in a room. Shaggy and Scooby happen upon a nest and an eagle appears and defends her nest and they run away. Fred, Velma and Daphne keep escaping after short encounters with the Indian. Scooby and Shaggy get chased by the Indian ghost and they happen upon an exit while Velma, Fred and Daphne find a robotic bull suit with helicopter rotors, and they deduce how there is a flying bull around. They watch as the Indian ghost hops into the bull about to take off. The three set a trap and it succeeds and then they find Shaggy and Scooby in a cowhide. Turns out the cowhide is a clue. The cow rustlers hid inside the cowhide to steal the cattle and used Tamuka as the reason the cows were disappearing. So, Shaggy and Scooby get in the cowhide and go into the herd to see who is stealing them and where. Shaggy and Scooby get taken up in a truck up to the mountains and Fred.

Later that night, when the airport is locked up, the ice encasing the shark begins to melt..... The gang is out water-skiing one afternoon. Scooby and Shaggy are out on the water and Fred, Daphne and Velma are in the boat. They turn the radio on and a news broadcast reports that two million dollars worth of pearls were stolen from the airport. Velma is baffled because the doors to the storage room were locked tight and the only one in there was the shark. Suddenly a real shark begins to chase the gang and they crash into a rocky cliff. They climb up the rocks for help to discover they are at Aqualand, a cliff-side aquarium. Upon entrance, they run into a bipedal shark monster! The gang flees and manages to lose him. Now the gang knows they have a mystery to solve. The gang heads to the manager's office. They go into the office and meet the manager of Aqualand, Mr. Dreyfus. He explains that he believes their scientist, Prof. Beaker, brought the shark back to life when it was transported to Aqualand. He tells them Prof. Beaker has some kind of spell book. They go to the lab and talk with Prof. Beaker, and he explains that he did no such thing. He shows them the encased shark-and the shark is still there-frozen in ice! Prof. Beaker claims he hasn't seen the spell book. The gang goes to talk with Mr. Wells, the manager's assistant. They get separated and Shaggy and Scooby are chased by the demon shark. Velma, Daphne and Fred run into Mr. Wells, who says he's never seen the shark.

It backfires, but the shark gets trapped anyway. They find valuable pearls inside the oysters-the stolen pearls from the airport. The shark is unmasked as Mr. Wells.

When the shark and pearls were locked up in the airport, Wells snuck out, stole the pearls, and hid back inside the compartment to be delivered back to Aqualand. He put the pearls inside oysters from Sam's Fish Market and wanted to ship them to another Aqualand in Florida to get them past police roadblocks.

Divorce. A seven-letter word that packs one of life's most potent punches. It has the power to unravel the world as we know it—affects not only the partners but leaves a reverberating impact on the family, especially on fathers. Tonight, I want to share a story—a narrative that's not just a tale of separation but a beacon of hope, resilience, and anew. This is the story of Emma, a woman whose decision to divorce her husband was not the end but the beginning of a transformative journey for her family, especially for the father of her children. Emma, like many, entered marriage with dreams and aspirations. She envisioned a life of partnership, of togetherness. But as the years went by, that dream slowly dismantled. The partnership became a solitude existence within a shared space. The togetherness turned into parallel lives under one roof. The decision to divorce, although painful, was a necessary step towards healing—a step towards reclaiming her happiness and indirectly setting a precedent for what love and respect should look like for her children. Now, let's pivot the lens to the father. The divorce was a wake-up call—an existential jolt that questioned his identity, his role as a parent, and his envisioning of the future. Here's where our story takes a hopeful turn. This seemingly devastating situation became the catalyst for an inspiring transformation. The initial despair and confusion slowly gave way to introspection. He began to understand that his identity was not just tethered to being a husband but was also deeply rooted in being a father—an irreplaceable figure in his children's lives. The separation forced him to confront his fears, evaluate his weaknesses, and most importantly, recognize the unwavering strength of his bond with his children. He started showing up—not just physically but emotionally. Every moment spent with his children became about quality, about making memories, and about healing together. His home, once a place of tension, transformed into a sanctuary of love, respect, and mutual growth. This story isn't about glamorizing divorce but about finding light in the darkest of tunnels. It's about understanding that sometimes, it’s the most painful decisions that pave the way for the most beautiful transformations. For fathers grappling with the aftermath of a divorce, let this story be a reminder that your role in your children's lives is irreplaceable. Your presence, your love, and your resilience in the face of adversity is your legacy. Embrace the change, lean into the discomfort, and slowly rebuild—a day at a time. Your children need not the perfection of a fairytale but the authenticity of your journey, your growth, and your unwavering love. In conclusion, let Emma's story be an inspiration to us all. It teaches us that endings are not just about closing chapters but about the courage to start anew. It's about transforming our trials into testimonies of strength, resilience, and unyielding hope. Thank you."},{"prompt":"include how the child support system is broken and the negative impact on fathers","completion":"Title: Rising from the Ashes: A Father's Journey into the Light In life’s vast canvas, change often arrives coated in uncertainty and turmoil. Divorce, a concept that once symbolized failure and end, can also mark the beginning of a profound journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Tonight, I share with you a narrative that weaves through the complexities of separation, focusing on the often-overlooked tribulations faced by fathers within the child support system—a system fraught with imperfections and challenges that can exacerbate the struggles of transitioning into a new chapter of life post-divorce. Let me introduce you to Andrew, a father whose story embodies resilience, transformation, and the fierce love for his children. When Andrew and his wife decided to part ways, it wasn’t only the emotional turmoil that he had to navigate, but the onset of a daunting combat with a child support system that seemed structured more as a battleground than a means of ensuring the welfare of his children. Andrew faced a paradox that many fathers encounter—a system that, in its intent to protect the interests of the child, inadvertently becomes a crucible of financial and emotional strain. The draconian measures and rigid frameworks often fail to consider the nuanced realities of individual cases. For Andrew, the child support payments were set at a rate that was disconnected from the dynamic nature of employment and income. In months when business was slow, making the full payment was not just challenging; it was crippling. This financial guillotine didn’t just strain Andrew’s resources; it threatened to sever the essential bond he fought so hard to maintain with his children. Every payment missed—despite his best efforts—painted him, in the eyes of a judgmental system, not as the loving father he was, but as a defaulter. The label was not just humiliating; it was alienating. The system, designed to ensure the children’s financial security, became an inadvertent architect of emotional distance between them and their father. Yet, it is within this crucible of challenge that Andrew’s story illuminates a vital lesson for us all. Confronted with a system that seemed insurmountable, Andrew channeled his struggle into advocacy—not just for himself but for fathers everywhere, ensnared in a similar plight. He began working with local support groups, advocating for reforms that acknowledge the complexities of post-divorce finances and the paramount importance of maintaining the emotional bonds between fathers and their children. Andrew's journey underscores the profound power of vulnerability and the importance of community. In sharing his story, he found solidarity with other fathers facing similar adversities. Together, they fostered a support network that was instrumental not only in navigating the child support system but also in preserving and strengthening the invaluable father-child relationship. The narrative of Andrew is a clarion call for a collective re-examination of the child support system—a call to sculpt a more compassionate, flexible framework that genuinely serves the best interests of the children it seeks to protect. A system that recognizes the inherent value of a father's love and the irreplaceable role it plays in a child's life. As we delve into stories like Andrew’s, we are reminded that within the crucible of adversity lies the potential for growth, advocacy, and profound change. It is a testament to the indomitable spirit of fathers everywhere who, in the face of systemic challenges, rise, advocate, and redefine the essence of resilience and love. To fathers navigating the complexities of the child support system, let Andrew's story be a beacon of hope—a reminder that your value is not defined by a system, but by the unbreakable bond of love and dedication to your children. Rise, advocate, and let your love be the guiding light in the darkest of times. Thank you."},{"prompt":"combine all just rearrange and make it better","completion":"Title: Embracing Change: Navigating Divorce and the Child Support System as a Beacon of Hope Good evening, everyone. Today, I stand before you to share a story. This is not just any story, but a narrative that intertwines the complexities of divorce with the challenges of navigating the child support system—a journey that, although fraught with adversity, serves as a powerful testament to resilience, hope, and transformative love. Let's embark on this story through the lens of Emma and Andrew, two individuals whose paths to post-divorce recovery illuminate the profound struggles yet undeniable strength of parents, particularly fathers, in the face of systemic challenges. Emma, a woman who made the heart-wrenching decision to divorce, envisioned not the end but a new beginning. Her journey wasn't just about reclaiming her happiness; it was about setting a precedent of love, respect, and emotional presence for her children. This tale, however, extends beyond Emma, casting a spotlight on the silent struggles faced by fathers—struggles embodied by Andrew, a man ensnared in the imperfections of the child support system. Andrew’s story unfolds in a familiar yet often overlooked battlefield. Post-divorce, he found himself grappling not only with the emotional toll of separation but also with the daunting prospects of a child support system that seemed more punitive than supportive. The fixed payments, rigidly imposed without regard to fluctuating incomes, threatened not just his financial stability but the very essence of his relationship with his children. But here, my friends, is where our narrative diverges from tales of despair to chronicles of hope. Andrew's confrontation with this broken system sparked a journey of advocacy and community building. Recognizing that his story was but one among many, he rallied with fellow fathers, advocating for reforms that acknowledged the nuanced realities of post-divorce finances and the irreplaceable value of a father's presence. Emma and Andrew's stories reflect the broader canvas of change and challenge. They illustrate that divorce and the struggles within the child support system are not just personal ordeals but opportunities for communal growth and systemic transformation. The key message that emanates from their journeys is one of hope. Emma’s decision to divorce, painful as it was, became a catalyst for healing and new beginnings. Andrew’s battle with the child support system morphed into a mission of advocacy, highlighting the need for a system that supports rather than separates, that values fathers not just as financial providers but as irreplaceable pillars of love and guidance. As we delve into these narratives, let us be reminded of the resilience that resides within the human spirit. Let Emma and Andrew's stories inspire us to view divorce not as an end but as a stepping stone to new beginnings. Let their journeys motivate us to advocate for a child support system that uplifts rather than undermines, that preserves the sanctity of the parent-child bond amid the trials of separation. In conclusion, let these stories be a beacon of hope to fathers navigating the complexities of the child support system. Your value is immeasurable, your love irreplaceable, and your resilience unparalleled. Rise, advocate, and let your dedication to your children illuminate the path through the darkest of times. Thank you."},{"prompt":"rewrite entirely but include the same key points more like a 20/20 story","completion":"**Title: Navigating the Storm: The Unseen Struggles of Divorced Fathers and the Road to Resolution** In the aftermath of a divorce, the fabric of family life is undeniably altered, affecting everyone involved in profound and lasting ways. Among the most poignant of these is the journey of fathers as they navigate the choppy waters of maintaining their roles and relationships with their children amidst the significant challenge of the child support system—a journey fraught with trials but also punctuated by moments of resilience and transformative change. Emma's decision to end her marriage, while heart-wrenching, was made with a vision of hope and new beginnings for her family. She envisioned a future where respect, love, and emotional presence defined the new boundaries of her restructured family unit. However, this transition wasn't solely about her own path to personal healing. It spotlighted a consequential facet of the post-divorce family dynamic: the challenges and transformations experienced by fathers, a narrative embodied by Andrew's experience. Andrew found himself at a crossroads, like many fathers post-divorce. The emotional strife of separation was compounded by an encounter with a child support system that seemed misaligned with the nuanced realities of fluctuating financial circumstances and the invaluable role of a father. The system's inflexibility did not just threaten his economic stability but risked eroding the very essence of his bond with his children—a relationship not defined by financial contributions alone but by countless moments of love, guidance, and presence. However, where there were obstacles, there was also opportunity. Andrew's struggle with the child support system ignited a larger conversation about its inadequacies and the need for a more compassionate, flexible approach that recognizes fathers as irreplaceable figures in their children's lives. His journey transformed into a mission of advocacy. Joining forces with other fathers facing similar trials, Andrew worked towards fostering a community where the challenges of post-divorce life could be met with mutual support and collective action for reform. The intertwined stories of Emma and Andrew are emblematic of the broader experience of many families navigating the aftermath of divorce. They shed light on the critical need for systemic change: a reimagining of the child support system that prioritizes the well-being and financial security of children while preserving the sanctity of the father-child relationship. In the face of adversity, Emma and Andrew’s stories are beacons of hope and reformation. They underscore the resilience of the human spirit and the profound capacity for growth and positive change amidst life's most challenging moments. This narrative calls for a collective re-evaluation of post-divorce support systems, advocating for solutions that uplift and empower families as they reshape their futures. Through this lens, the journey of divorced fathers is not just a personal odyssey but a pivotal chapter in the ongoing story of our societal evolution towards understanding, empathy, and meaningful support for all members of the family unit navigating the complexities of life post-divorce. In sharing these stories, we are reminded that while the seas of change may be tumultuous, the potential for healing, unity, and systemic improvement sails within reach, guiding families like Emma’s and Andrew’s towards brighter, more hopeful horizons."},{"prompt":"include fathers that saved the marriage at the brink and how they got the women to change their minds","completion":"**Title: At The Brink: Stories of Renewal, Resilience, and Reconciliation** In the intricate tapestry of family life, there lie stories of challenge, transformation, and sometimes, against all odds, reconciliation. These narratives often go unheard, shadowed by the more frequently told tales of separation. Yet, within the framework of families teetering on the edge of divorce, there are profound lessons to be learned from fathers who navigated the stormy waters of marital discord, not only emerging intact but stronger, with stories of renewal and resilience. In addition to the journey of Emma, who once stood at the crossroads of divorce, and Andrew, who faced the adversities of the child support system, there are other tales worth telling. These are the stories of fathers who recognized the impending dissolve of their marriage and took transformative steps to not only save it but to foster a deeper connection with their partners, rewriting the ending many thought was inevitable. Take Jacob, for example, a man who saw the warning signs of discontent brewing within his marriage. Faced with the prospect of a fractured family unit, Jacob embarked on a journey of self-reflection and open communication. Recognizing the mutual drift that had occurred over years of neglected conversations and unaddressed grievances, he extended an olive branch to his wife—a proposal to start anew, rooted in transparency, understanding, and respect. Jacob's efforts to save his marriage were anything but straightforward. It required counseling sessions where vulnerabilities were laid bare, and ongoing open dialogues were established. It was his commitment to change and his unwavering dedication to his family that ultimately led to his wife reassessing the decision to part ways. Together, they found a new foundation to rebuild their marriage, one built on mutual respect, understanding, and a renewed commitment to nurture their bond. Similarly, Michael's story reveals another facet of reconciliation. At the brink of divorce, Michael recognized that the financial pressures exerted by the existing child support system not only strained his relationship with his wife but also his bond with his children. In a heartfelt attempt to address these challenges, he proposed alternative solutions that would ensure the welfare of their children while also preserving their marriage. His proactive approach highlighted the importance of finding common ground and working together towards the well-being of the family as a whole. These stories of Jacob, Michael, and others like them underscore an important message: the path to reconciliation is paved with the willingness to change, understand, and compromise. Fathers who saved their marriages at the brink did so by not only recognizing their own roles in the discord but also by actively participating in crafting solutions that honored the needs and feelings of all family members involved. In a broader sense, these narratives serve as a guiding light for families navigating similar turbulent waters. They remind us that even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges, there remains hope for renewal and reconciliation. It is the resilience to confront issues head-on, the courage to embrace change, and the strength to forge a path of mutual understanding that can lead families back from the brink, towards a future of shared happiness and unity. As we recount these tales of perseverance and love, let them inspire those on the edge of giving up, to consider the possibilities that can arise from open hearts and open minds. In the spectrum of family dynamics, every story has its place, including those of revival and the rekindling of bonds once thought to be lost. In sharing these stories, we don't just celebrate the triumphs over adversity but also recognize the power of human connection, the capacity for forgiveness, and the enduring strength of family unity."},{"prompt":"(In the town of Axel...)

[엄마, 안 아파. 그냥 악몽을 꿨을 뿐이야.] 이 말을 하고 싶었지만, 하지 않았다. 내가 천재가 아니라는 사실에 충격받아 악몽을 꿨단 말을 어찌한단 말이냐고! 나는 시무룩한 얼굴로 옷만 갈아입고 TV를 켰다. 아침 경제 뉴스는 놓칠 수 없었다. 세상이 어떻게 돌아가는지 내가 알 수 있는 유일한 수단이기도 했다. 뉴스에서는 경제 호황과 X세대의 등장이라는 이슈를 다뤘다. [쯧쯧. 이제 곧 IMF야. 추락에 연착륙은 없다는 것만 알아둬.] 곧 증시 상황이 등장했다. 아직까지는 상승장이었다. 삼전 주식도 꽤 좋은 편이었다. 나는 경제 뉴스를 챙겨보고는 엄마가 준 바나나를 우걱우걱 씹으며 책을 펼쳤다. 이번 생에서 나는 121이라는 평범한 아이큐로 태어났다. 이 평범함을 극복하기 위해서는 노력만이 살길이다! 기본부터 탄탄히! 어느새 다가온 엄마가 나를 걱정스레 바라봤다. “성국아, 아픈데 오늘 유치원 쉴까?” 도리도리. [한 자라도 더 배워야 해. 유치원에서 공짜로 영어 회화 한단 말이야. 언어는 안 쓰면 잊어버려, 엄마.] * * * 대한민국에 한 대밖에 없는 차. 방탄유리는 기본이고, 각종 보안이 대통령급인 차가 삼전 유치원의 주차장으로 들어왔다. 삼전 유치원 앞에 차가 멈춰 서자, 기다리고 있던 유치원 원장이 얼른 뒷문으로 가서 차 문을 열었다. 철의 여인이 익숙한 듯 유유히 차에서 내렸다. 반대편으로는 유치원 교복을 입고, 명품 브랜드의 가방을 멘 전미진이 유치원 교사의 손을 잡고 내렸다. 블랙을 기본으로 화려한 패턴의 스카프와 누구나 살 수 없다는 가방. 그리고 그녀의 패션을 완성해주는 킬힐까지. 유치원 원장이 생글생글 웃으며 철의 여인을 맞이했다. “여기까지 납셔 주시다니 영광입니다.” 조선시대의 왕비도 아닌데, 왕과 왕비에게나 쓰는 극존칭을 받는 존재가 바로 철의 여인이었다. 어쩌면 삼전이라는 이름이 들어간 모든 것은 그들의 제국인지도 몰랐다. “딸 수업을 한번 직접 보고 싶어서요.” “네, 미리 연락받았습니다. 불편하지 않게 지켜보시도록 준비하겠습니다.” 철의 여인은 원장의 안내에 따라서 유치원 안으로 들어갔다. A반은 삼전 그룹의 일반 직원들이 다니는 곳과 분리된 별채에 위치했다. 이 아이들만을 위한 전용 운동장과 놀이기구가 보였다. 철의 여인이 이 자리에 직접 온 이유는 바로 성국이를 지켜보기 위해서였다. 또각. 또각. 또각. 철의 여인의 하이힐 소리가 복도에 울려 퍼지고, 창문 너머로 성국이가 보였다. 삼전 전자 광고 모델을 할 정도로 외모야 훌륭하지만, 거기다 천재란 말이지? 원장이 철의 여인 옆으로 다가오더니 조용히 속삭였다. “곧 영어 수업 시작입니다. 담당인 이지은 선생님이 오셔서 사모님이 궁금하신 사항들 다 알려드릴 것입니다.” 까닥. 철의 여인은 입은 열지도 않았다. 곧 토마스가 반에 들어가고, 담당인 이지은 선생님은 조용히 뒷문으로 빠져나왔다. 이지은 선생님은 얼른 인사를 하고 철의 여인 한 발짝 뒤로 섰다. “저… 전성국 군의 학업 성취도와 교우 관계에 대해서 궁금해하신다고 들었습니다.” “미진이가 걱정이 돼서요. 친구로서 곁에 둬도 괜찮은 아이인지 알고 싶어요.” “처음엔 아이들과 배경이 달라서 잘 못 어울렸는데요. 지금은 성국이가 영어나 제2외국어인 프랑스어까지 능숙하게 해서 아이들과 스스럼없이 어울리고 있습니다.” “영어와 제2외국어가 어느 정도 수준이라고 하던가요?” “영어 담당이신 토마스 선생님 말로는 자신과 일상적인 대화를 하는 데는 전혀 지장이 없고, 원서도 무리 없이 보는 수준이라고 하시더라고요. 그리고 놀라운 점은 학습 태도라고 하셨어요. 이미 성인 수준의 훌륭한 어휘를 구사하는데도, 끊임없이 노력한다고요. 프랑스어도 마찬가지고요.” 프랑스어는 철의 여인이 직접 눈으로 확인했다. “다음 수업은 뭐죠?” “가을 학기 시작하고 선생님 사정으로 잠시 쉬었던 피아노 레슨이 있습니다.” “그럼, 성국 군은 처음이겠네요.” “네.” 철의 여인은 팔짱을 끼곤 성국이를 지켜봤다. 가난한 집 아이가 우연히 천재로 태어날 수는 있다. 하지만 예술은 절대 가난한 집 아이들은 누릴 수 없는 특권이었다. * * * 토마스가 영어 원서로 된 <호밀밭의 파수꾼>을 내밀었다. “성국, 이 책 빌려달라고 했지?” “녜에!” 나는 고개를 끄덕였다. 며칠 전에 토마스에게 TV에서 봤다며 이 책을 읽고 싶다고 했더니 자기에게 책이 있다며 흔쾌히 빌려주겠다고 했다. “이 책 읽을 수 있겠어?” 토마스는 조금 걱정스레 물었다. [읽을 수 있냐고? 내가 이 책을 얼마나 좋아하는지 알고 싶다면 물어보는 게 빠를 텐데.] 저번 생에서 나는 이 책을 수십 번은 족히 읽고 또 읽었다. 처음엔 번역서로 접했고, 다음엔 영어 원서를 읽었다. 이 책에 나온 한겨울의 센트럴파크를 보기 위해 한겨울에 일부러 뉴욕을 방문하러 간 일도 있었다. 정말 그 많던 오리들은 어디로 날아간 것일까? 사춘기 시절 학업의 스트레스를 이 책을 읽으며 이겨냈다. 다른 게 있다면 주인공인 홀든 콜필드와 나와의 성적 차이 정도였다. 홀든 콜필드는 낙제생이었지만, 나는 저번 생에서도 단 한 번도 1등을 놓친 적 없는 수재였다. 나는 기쁜 마음으로 책을 받아 들고 토마스를 향해 찡끗 웃어줬다. “땡뀨, 토마스!” 토마스는 나의 살인 미소에 환하게 웃으며 내가 이 책을 읽을 수 있냐 같은 질문은 이미 기억에서 지워버린 듯했다. “성국, 모르는 건 언제나 물어봐.” “물론이지!” 나는 고개를 끄덕이고는 자리에 가서 앉았다. 어서 이 책을 읽고 싶어 미칠 지경이었다. <호밀밭의 파수꾼>의 첫 장을 넘기던 때였다. 이지은 선생님이 젊은 남자를 한 명 데리고 들어왔다. 나는 그가 누군지 한눈에 알아봤다. 내 피아노 선생님이기도 했던 피아니스트 조성원이었다. 대한민국 사람으로는 최초로 쇼팽 콩쿠르 우승자이자, 세계적인 피아니스트. [샘, 오랜만이야!] 조성원은 나를 한동안 뚫어져라 쳐다보더니 천천히 입을 열었다. “안녕.” 조성원은 작은 목소리로 나에게 인사를 했다. [나한테 지금 인사한 거야?] 나는 놀라서 얼굴이 굳었다. 이번 생에서 우리가 알 일은 지난 5년 동안 단 한 번도 없었다. “네가 성국이구나.” [날 어떻게 아는 거지?] “TV에서 봤어. 나도 팬이야.” 쫄깃했던 심장이 겨우 다시 팽팽해졌다. 요즘 너무 공부만 하다 보니 내가 나름 인기 있었던 아역 모델이었던 것을 깜빡깜빡 잊을 때가 많았다. 조성원은 교실에 위치한 피아노 앞에 앉더니 우리들에게 쇼팽의 발라드를 하나 들려줬다. 그러곤 우리를 쳐다봤다. “이 음악 들어본 사람?” 나를 제외한 다섯 명의 아이들이 손을 번쩍 들었다. 물론 나도 이 음악을 잘 알았다. 쇼팽의 피아노 발라드 중 1번이었다. G단조의 이 음악은 나도 즐겨 치던 곡 중에 하나였다. 하지만 나는 입을 꾹 다문 채 알은척을 하진 않았다. 창밖에서 철의 여인이 지켜보는 것을 알고 있었다. 철의 여인이 수업을 지켜보는 이유는 하나일 것이다. 내가 견제할 만한 아이인지, 아닌지. 그것을 알고 싶은 것일 터였다. 나는 순진하게 눈을 끔뻑거리며 음악만 들었다. “성국이는 처음 들어봐요?” “녜에!” 나는 자신만만하게 대답했다. 모르는 게 죄는 아니다. 다섯 살이 쇼팽을 모른다고 창피할 일도 아니다. 다른 수업 시간에는 조용하던 김주성이 잘난 척을 했다. “성국아, 너희 집은 클래식 안 들어?” [우리 엄마, 아빠 취향은 서태지와 아이들이랑 넥스트야. 니들은 아나 모르겠다. 나중에 K-POP이 전 세계를 강타한다고, 이것들아. 내가 클래식에 대해서 입 열면 너희들이 불쌍해질까 봐 참아주는 거야.] 나는 애매하게 웃었다. “모르는 친구도 있으니까, 그럼 선생님이 이 곡에 대해서 설명하고 우리 한 소절씩 쳐보도록 하자.” 나는 탁자 아래에서 손가락을 우두둑 풀었다. 간만에 피아노를 친다는 생각에 좀 흥분되긴 했지만, 피아노는 정말 처음 쳐보는 것처럼 연기해야 했다. [아역 은퇴하면 연기 안 해도 살 줄 알았더니….] 이번 생 자체가 연기였다. 나는 손가락을 풀면서 조성원 선생님의 쇼팽 이야기에 귀를 기울였다. 아이들이 차례차례 나가서 조성원 선생님의 지도를 받았다. 전미진 다음이 내 차례였다. 전미진은 능숙하진 않지만, 퉁탕거리며 피아노를 쳐댔다. 역시 예전이나 지금이나 전미진은 인풋 대비 아웃풋이 늘 아쉬웠다. 전미진 역시 조성원에게 직접 피아노 레슨을 받을 텐데, 저 정도 실력이라니. “성국이 차례예요.” 조성원은 내 겨드랑이에 손을 껴서 들어 올려 피아노 의자에 앉혔다. 눈앞에 검고 흰 건반이 늘어섰다. [정말 치고 싶었는데….] 나는 피아노를 물끄러미 바라봤다. 그리고 작고 통통한 내 손을 쫙 펼쳐서 건반 위에 올렸다. 조성원은 다정하게 이야기했다. “성국이는 피아노 처음 친다고 했죠?” “녜에! 처음이요.” “여기가 도예요. 오른손으로 선생님처럼 이렇게 음계를 쭉 쳐볼까요?” 조성원은 오른손으로 피아노 음계를 쭉 이어 쳤다. 나는 곧 오른손으로 조성원과 같이 음계를 쭉 이어서 쳤다. 조성원이 눈을 반짝이기 시작했다. “처음인데… 진짜 잘하는데.” 이번엔 왼손도 따로 연습했다. 작은 손이 음계를 누르기엔 한계가 있었지만, 무난하게 왼손으로도 음계를 쳐냈다. “처음치고 정말 잘하네.” 조성원은 또다시 칭찬했다. 감정을 억누르는 게 보였지만, 무척 놀란 기색이었다. “헤헤.” 나는 해맑게 웃었다. 애매할 땐 그냥 웃는 게 최고였다. 아마 이런 내 모습을 보면서 철의 여인도 마음 한편에 조금 여유가 생겼을 것이다. 모든 게 완벽하지만, 결국 문화적 소양은 없는 가난한 집 출신. 철의 여인이 확인하고픈 것은 이것이었을 테니까. * * * 철의 여인 얼굴에 온화한 미소가 돌았다. 자신이 예상한 것이 적중했다. 가난하게 자란 아이라 피아노는 난생처음 쳐보는 것이 뻔히 보였다. 곧잘 따라 하긴 했지만, 그건 학습 능력이 좋아서였다. 거기다 쇼팽 곡도 처음 듣는다니. 철의 여인은 왠지 마음이 놓였다. 그리고 자신이 얼마나 터무니없는 상상을 한 것인지 깨달았다. ‘겨우 다섯 살짜리한테, 내가 무슨 상상을 한 거지.’ 살짝 헛웃음까지 나왔다. 철의 여인은 전재형 회장의 전폭적인 지지를 받는 성국이를 보면서 태국이의 후계자 자리를 위협할 존재로 인식했다. 태국이가 여러 면에서 기대에 못 미쳐서 전재형 회장의 눈 밖에 난 지 오래됐다. 철의 여인은 태국이가 아직 10대이니 조금 더 기다려 달라고 했지만, 그녀도 전재형 회장도 알고 있었다. 인재는 떡잎부터 다르다는 것을. 우연히 성국이의 천재성을 보게 된 이후부터 괜히 불안했다. 전재형 회장이 성국이를 눈여겨보는 것이 혹시 자신의 뒤를 이을 삼전 그룹의 후계자로 생각하는 게 아닌가 해서였다. 하지만 아직은 그렇게 위협적인 존재는 아니었다. 그냥 가난한 집안에서 태어난 똑똑한 아이일 뿐이었다. 스르륵- 교실 문이 열리더니 조성원이 나왔다. 철의 여인은 여유로운 얼굴로 조성원을 쳐다봤다. “연주회 중에도 시간 내주셔서 감사해요. 오늘 아이들 교육은 어떠셨어요?” “미진이가 아주 잘 따라와주는 것 같아요.” “미진이는 어차피 예능을 시킬 생각인데, 피아노 어떨까요?” “글쎄요.” 조성원은 애매하게 웃었다. 세계적으로 유명한 피아니스트인 만큼 삼전 그룹 사모님이라고 해도 입에 발린 아부를 할 생각은 없었다. “혹, 이 반에 재능 있는 아이가 있나요? 엄마들 모임에서 힌트라도 좀 주게요.” “다들 이미 레슨도 받아서 어느 정도 실력들은 있지만… 제가 보기엔 성국이가 재능이 있어 보였어요. 꼭 제가 처음 피아노를 시작할 때 모습 같았어요.” 철의 여인의 미소는 어느새 사라지고 없었다.","completion":"Episode 34 I am not a genius. 7 AM. My eyes slowly opened. Suddenly, I couldn't understand English that I used to understand well, and I even had a nightmare where I couldn't utter a single word. My back was soaked.

With a gloomy face, I just changed my clothes and turned on the TV. I couldn't miss the morning economic news. It was the only way I could understand how the world works. The news covered the economic boom and the emergence of Generation X. [Tsk tsk. The IMF crisis is coming soon. Just remember, there's no such thing as a soft landing in a crash.] Soon, the stock market situation appeared. It was still a bull market. Samsung Electronics stocks were doing quite well. After watching the economic news, I chewed on a banana my mom gave me and opened a book. In this life, I was born with an average IQ of 121. To overcome this mediocrity, effort was the only way out! Solid fundamentals! Before I knew it, Mom came over and looked at me worriedly. \\"Sung-guk, are you sick? Should we skip kindergarten today?\\" I shook my head.

As the car stopped in front of Samsung Kindergarten, the waiting principal hurried to the back door to open it. The Iron Lady stepped out gracefully. On the other side, Jeon Mi-jin, wearing a kindergarten uniform and carrying a luxury brand bag, got out holding the hand of a kindergarten teacher. Black as the base, with a flashy patterned scarf, a bag that not everyone could afford, and her fashion completed with killer heels. The principal greeted the Iron Lady with a bright smile. \\"It's an honor to have you here.\\" She was treated with the highest respect, a treatment reserved for kings and queens, and she was none other than the Iron Lady. Perhaps everything with the name Samsung was their empire. \\"I wanted to see my daughter's class myself.\\" \\"Yes, we were informed in advance. We'll make sure you can observe without any inconvenience.\\" The Iron Lady followed the principal into the kindergarten. Class A was located in a separate annex from where the regular employees of the Samsung Group sent their children. There was a playground and play equipment exclusively for these children. The reason the Iron Lady came in person was to watch Sung-guk. Click-clack. Click-clack. Click-clack. The sound of the Iron Lady's high heels echoed in the hallway, and Sung-guk was visible through the window. He had the looks to be a model for Samsung Electronics ads, but a genius too? The principal approached the Iron Lady and whispered quietly. \\"The English class is about to start. The teacher, Ms. Lee Ji-eun, will come out and tell you everything you're curious about.\\" Click. The Iron Lady didn't even open her mouth. Soon, Thomas entered the class, and Ms. Lee Ji-eun, the teacher, quietly slipped out the back door. Ms. Lee Ji-eun quickly greeted and stood a step behind the Iron Lady. \\"I heard you were curious about Sung-guk's academic achievements and social relationships.\\" \\"I'm worried about Mi-jin. I want to know if he's a good friend to keep by her side.\\" \\"At first, he didn't fit in well with the other kids because of different backgrounds. But now, Sung-guk is fluent in English and even in French, his second foreign language, so he's getting along with them without any problems.\\" \\"How proficient is he in English and the second foreign language?\\" \\"According to Mr. Thomas, the English teacher, he has no problem having everyday conversations with him, and he can read original texts without any difficulty. And what's amazing is his attitude towards learning. He constantly strives even though he already uses vocabulary at an adult level. The same goes for French.\\" The Iron Lady had seen his proficiency in French with her own eyes. \\"What's the next class?\\" \\"There's a piano lesson that was paused for a while due to the teacher's circumstances at the start of the fall semester.\\" \\"Then, it's Sung-guk's first time.\\" \\"Yes.\\" The Iron Lady crossed her arms and watched Sung-guk. A poor child could accidentally be born a genius. But art was a privilege that poor children could never enjoy. * * * Thomas handed out \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" in English. \\"Sung-guk, you wanted to borrow this book, right?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I nodded. A few days ago, I told Thomas I wanted to read this book after seeing it on TV, and he happily agreed to lend it to me since he had it. \\"Can you read this book?\\" Thomas asked with a bit of worry. [Can I read it? If you want to know how much I like this book, it would be faster to ask.] In my previous life, I read this book dozens of times. At first, I encountered it through a translated version, and then I read the original English version. I even visited New York in the middle of winter just to see Central Park in winter, as described in the book. Where did all those ducks go during winter? I overcame the stress of my studies during my teenage years by reading this book. The only difference was the academic gap between Holden Caulfield, the protagonist, and me. Holden Caulfield was a failing student, but in my previous life, I was a prodigy who never missed being the top of my class. I happily took the book and gave Thomas a beaming smile. \\"Thank you, Thomas!\\" Thomas smiled brightly at my killer smile, as if he had already forgotten his question about whether I could read the book. \\"Sung-guk, always ask if you don't know something.\\" \\"Of course!\\" I nodded and sat down. I was dying to read the book. Just as I was turning the first page of \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" Ms. Lee Ji-eun came in with a young man. I recognized him at a glance. He was my piano teacher and a pianist, Jo Sung-won. The first Korean to win the Chopin Competition and a world-renowned pianist. [Sam, long time no see!] Jo Sung-won stared at me for a while and then slowly opened his mouth. \\"Hello.\\" Jo Sung-won greeted me in a soft voice. [Did he just greet me?] I was surprised and my face stiffened. In the past five years of this life, there was never a moment when we knew each other. \\"You're Sung-guk.\\" [How does he know me?] \\"I saw you on TV. I'm a fan.\\" My heart, which had been tense, finally relaxed. Lately, I've been studying so much that I often forget I was a popular child model. Jo Sung-won sat in front of the piano in the classroom and played one of Chopin's ballades for us. Then he looked at us. \\"Has anyone heard this music?\\" Five other kids, excluding me, raised their hands. Of course, I knew this music well. It was Chopin's Piano Ballade No. 1 in G minor. I also enjoyed playing this piece. But I kept my mouth shut and didn't show off. The Iron Lady was watching from outside the window. There was only one reason for the Iron Lady to observe the class. To see if I was a child worth keeping an eye on or not. I blinked innocently and just listened to the music. \\"Sung-guk, is this your first time hearing it?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I confidently answered. Not knowing isn't a crime. It's not embarrassing for a five-year-old not to know Chopin. During other class times, Kim Ju-sung showed off. \\"Sung-guk, doesn't your family listen to classical music?\\" [My mom and dad prefer Seo Taiji and Boys and N.EX.T. You guys might not know them. Later, K-POP will take over the world. I'm holding back from talking about classical music because I don't want you guys to feel sorry.] I smiled ambiguously. \\"Since there are friends who don't know, let's have the teacher explain this piece and try playing a section each.\\" I cracked my fingers under the table. The thought of playing the piano for the first time in a while excited me, but I had to act as if it was my first time playing the piano. [I thought I could live without acting after retiring as a child actor...] This life itself was an act. I loosened my fingers while listening to Jo Sung-won's story about Chopin. The kids took turns going out to receive guidance from Jo Sung-won. It was Jeon Mi-jin's turn before mine. Jeon Mi-jin played the piano clumsily but persistently. As always, Jeon Mi-jin's input versus output was disappointing. Jeon Mi-jin was also receiving piano lessons directly from Jo Sung-won, but her skills were just that. \\"Sung-guk, it's your turn.\\" Jo Sung-won lifted me by my armpits and placed me on the piano chair. The black and white keys stretched out in front of me. [I really wanted to play...] I stared at the piano and stretched my small, chubby hands over the keys. Jo Sung-won spoke kindly. \\"Sung-guk, you said it's your first time playing the piano, right?\\" \\"Yes! It's my first time.\\" \\"Here is 'do.' Try playing the scale like the teacher, starting with your right hand.\\" Jo Sung-won played the piano scale with his right hand. I followed and played the scale with my right hand. Jo Sung-won's eyes began to sparkle. \\"For a first-timer... you're really good.\\" This time, I practiced with my left hand separately. Although my small hands had limitations in pressing the keys, I managed to play the scale with my left hand smoothly. \\"For a first-timer, you're really good.\\" Jo Sung-won praised me again. He tried to hide his emotions, but he looked very surprised. \\"Hehe.\\" I smiled brightly. When in doubt, just smile. Perhaps the Iron Lady, watching this scene, felt a bit more at ease. Perfect in every way, but ultimately lacking cultural sophistication due to coming from a poor family. This must have been what the Iron Lady wanted to confirm. * * * A warm smile spread across the Iron Lady's face. Her expectations were met. It was clear that the child, raised in poverty, was playing the piano for the first time. He followed along well, but that was due to his good learning ability. Moreover, it was his first time hearing a Chopin piece. The Iron Lady felt somewhat relieved. And she realized how absurd her imagination had been. 'I was imagining things about a mere five-year-old.' She even chuckled lightly. The Iron Lady had regarded Sung-guk, who received full support from Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, as a threat to Tae-gyung's position as the heir. Tae-gyung had fallen out of favor with Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung for not meeting expectations for a long time. The Iron Lady had asked for more time, saying Tae-gyung was still in his teens, but she and Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung knew. Talent is evident from the start. After accidentally witnessing Sung-guk's genius, she became unnecessarily anxious. She worried that Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's interest in Sung-guk might be considering him as a potential successor to the Samsung Group. But he wasn't such a threatening presence yet. Just a smart kid from a poor family. Swoosh- The classroom door opened, and Jo Sung-won came out. The Iron Lady looked at Jo Sung-won with a relaxed face. \\"Thank you for making time even during your concert. How was teaching the kids today?\\" \\"Mi-jin seems to be following along very well.\\" \\"I'm thinking of putting Mi-jin into performing arts, but what about the piano?\\" \\"Well...\\" Jo Sung-won smiled ambiguously. As a world-famous pianist, he had no intention of flattering the Samsung Group's lady with insincere compliments. \\"By the way, is there a talented child in this class? Give me a hint for the mothers' meeting.\\" \\"They all have some skills since they've been taking lessons, but... in my opinion, Sung-guk seems to have talent. He reminded me of myself when I first started playing the piano.\\" The smile on the Iron Lady's face had disappeared."},{"prompt":"What's the fastest way to get the absolute value of a number with only bitwise AND, OR, XOR, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and a Left Shift Right by one bit? I can only use the variables I have on hand for this (A and 1), with 4 registers.","completion":"Using only bitwise AND, OR, XOR, addition, subtraction, multiplication, a Left Shift Right by one bit, and the variables (A and 1) with 4 registers, we can find the absolute value of a number through manipulating its sign bit and its value directly. This process doesn't strictly require all operations mentioned, but we'll stick to the constraints and use the operations you've noted. Let's assume the registers are named R1, R2, R3, and R4, and initially, R1 contains the value \`A\` whose absolute value we need to calculate. The number \`1\` can be used for any necessary operations involving the constant 1. Here is a strategy that could be used: 1. **Determine the Sign of \`A\`**: Since we want the absolute value, the first step is to check if \`A\` is negative. This is done by isolating the most significant bit (MSB) which serves as the sign bit in two's complement notation (assuming the numbers are represented in this form). The arithmetic right shift operation preserves the sign bit while shifting, which is useful for sign extension but since we only have a logical Shift Right available (I'm assuming based on your \\"Left Shift Right\\" description), we'll have to improvise. 2. **Isolate the Sign Bit and Create a Mask**: - First, logically shift \`A\` right by 31 bits (\`>>\` is logical right shift, but left shift \`<<\` is given, we can adapt if necessary). This cannot be directly done with a single \\"Left Shift Right by one bit\\" operation but can be implied for understanding how we would isolate the bit in some architectures. - Then, use the result to generate a bitmask that has all bits set to the sign bit of \`A\`. 3. **Invert \`A\` Conditionally and Add 1 if Negative**: Since in two's complement, a negative number's absolute value can be found by inverting all bits and adding 1, apply this conditional operation based on the mask. Here's a bit of a generalized approach given the operations: - **Extract sign bit**: - R2 = R1 >> 31 (Assuming logical right shift. If you only have arithmetic shift or left shift, you'd adjust by shifting left by 31 then back if needed.) - **Make a mask with the sign**: - Assuming we simulated R2 = R1 >> 31 somehow: R3 = R2 XOR (R2 XOR R2) - This would set all bits in R3 to the sign bit of R1 if we had a direct way to get R2 = sign. - **Utilize the mask to conditionally negate**: - To negate \`A\` based on its sign, XOR \`A\` with the mask then add the mask + 1: - R4 = R1 XOR R3 (This inverts \`A\`'s bits only if it was negative) - Finally, R4 = R4 + (R3 AND 1) This approach glosses over the challenge of not directly having a way to logically right-shift by 31 or any number of bits but follows the basic principles for achieving the task with math and logical operations. The key assumption that you can right-shift by any number of bits directly contradicts the constraints, indicating this solution conceptualizes steps that need adjustment or using creative sequences of the allowed operations to achieve similar outcomes. Given the strict operational limits and aiming for a solution within those bounds, it becomes a complex problem especially without direct shifts or conditionals. Correctly isolating the sign and performing operations based directly on that would typically require some form of comparison or conditional execution not available here, indicating a direct solution might not be fully achievable with mentioned constraints without clever tricks specific to the bit-width of the numbers or additional operations not listed being possible."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[하아, 내가 이 싸구려 맛 나는 카레를 좋아하게 될 줄이야.] 정말 저번 생에서는 꿈도 못 꾼 일이었다. 하지만 엄마가 만들어주는 카레는 이 세상에서 삼전 호텔의 짜장면에 이어서 두 번째로 맛있었다. “성국아, 천천히 먹어.” “잘 먹겠습니댜!” 나는 인사를 하고는 얼른 카레를 입에 밀어 넣었다. [역시 맛있어.] 어깨춤이 절로 나왔다. 이때, 집 전화가 요란하게 울렸다. 엄마는 얼른 젖은 손을 닦고는 전화를 받았다. “양 비서님, 잘 지내시죠?” [양 비서가 무슨 일로 전화를 했지?] “성국이 진로에 대해서 상담할 내용이 있으시다고요? 네. 다음 주 월요일이 남편 가게 쉬는 날이에요. 알겠습니다.” 엄마는 전화를 끊고는 고개를 갸웃했다. “성국아, 유치원에서 무슨 일 있었어?” [흠….] 나는 우선 도리도리를 했다. 하지만 유치원에서 일어났던 일 중 하나는 분명히 알았다. 바로 조성원을 만난 일. 그리고 그걸 지켜보던 철의 여인. 철의 여인의 생각이 조금 짐작이 됐다. [설마 나를 피아니스트로 만들 작정인가.] 철의 여인이라면 그러고도 남을 사람이다. 살가운 어머니는 아니었지만, 자식의 앞날을 방해하는 것은 뭐든 정리해줬다. “성국아, 엄마 잠시 빨래 널고 올게. 민국이 좀 봐줄 수 있지?” “응. 엄마, 빨리 와.” “엄마가 와서 바나나 줄게.” “응!” 나는 밥을 먹고는 거실을 뱅글뱅글 돌고 있는 민국이 녀석을 봤다. 책은 한 줄도 안 읽었고, 뉴스에도 관심도 없고, 하는 일이라고는 먹고, 싸고, 노는 것밖에 없었다. 나는 민국이 녀석을 한심하게 쳐다봤다. [너 대체 커서 뭐 될래? 아무리 형이 돈 많이 벌어도, 너도 돈을 벌어야 해. 사지 멀쩡한 사람이 놀면 안 된다. 알았지?] “혀엉.” 민국이 녀석이 내 곁으로 오더니 얼굴을 들이밀더니 뺨에 얼굴을 부비부비했다. 내가 잔소리를 하면 요즘 이 녀석은 맨날 나한테 와서 얼굴을 들이밀었다. [저리 가라. 좋게 말할 때.] “혀엉.” 민국이는 혀 짧은 소리로 헤헤 웃을 뿐이었다. [정말 이 녀석 미래가 걱정된다, 돼.] “에휴-.” 난 벌써부터 민국이 걱정에 눈앞이 캄캄했다. 이 녀석 잘 커서 사람 구실이나 할까? 이런 내 무거운 마음을 아는지 모르는지 민국이는 내게 안기더니 헤헤 웃어댔다. “혀엉. 조아.” [난 너 별로 안 좋아해. 이젠 경쟁자가 아니라 넌 내 인생의 짐이야, 짐.] 나는 축 처진 어깨로 민국이를 내려다봤다. “밍구가. 형이 좋아?” “응!” “왜에?” “형이자나.” 뭉클. 진짜 이번 생에서는 심장이 고장 난 것 같았다. 별것도 아닌 말에 심장이 뭉클했다. [그래, 한번 안아줄게. 이리 와봐.] 민국이는 나를 꼬옥 안았다. 민국이 몸에서 베이비파우더 향기가 솔솔 올라왔다. [아하, 이 녀석 미래도 내가 좀 설계해 봐야겠구나.] 나는 민국이를 엄하게 쳐다봤다. “전민국, 내 말 잘 들어야 해. 아랐어?” “녜에!” 민국이가 해맑게 웃었다. [흠… 유치원 다니느라 잊고 있었는데, 이 녀석 좀 귀엽게 생겼네. 나보다야 못하지만, 이 정도 얼굴이면 뭐든 할 수 있겠어.] 웃는 모습은 제법 귀여웠고, 나보다 멍청하긴 했지만 말귀는 잘 알아들었다. 아역 모델이나 배우에게 그만큼 중요한 일도 없었다. “성국아, 민국이랑 잘 놀고 있었네. 엄마가 얼른 바나나 줄게.” “엄마!” 나는 엄마를 불러 세웠다. “왜, 성국아?” “민국이. 민국이 아역 시켜 봐요.” “뭐라고?” 엄마가 놀라 나를 쳐다봤다. “민국이 연기 잘해요. 잘 웃어요.” “민국이가 그렇긴 한데….” “성국아, 그거 네 생각이야?” 물론 내 생각이지만, 내 생각이라고 말하면 엄마를 움직이긴 어려울 것 같았다. “민국이가 그랬어요.” “민국이가?” “응.” 나는 단호하게 고개를 끄덕였다. 엄마는 민국이의 어깨를 잡더니 눈을 맞췄다. “민국아, 너 아역 모델 하고 싶어?” “녜에!” 민국이가 크게 대답했다. 사실은 내가 좀 전에 엄마 말에 무조건 네라고 하면 잘 때 엄마 곁을 양보해 준다고 말했다. 그날 밤, 나는 베개를 안고 일어났다. 자려고 누운 엄마와 아빠가 이상하게 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 잠이 안 와?” 아빠가 나를 안으려고 다가왔다. 나는 한 발짝 뒤로 물러섰다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “아빠, 나 혼자 잘래요.” “갑자기? 지금?” “네에!” 나는 어느새 엄마 옆자리를 차지하고 누워 있는 민국이를 내려다봤다. 비록 세 살짜리와의 약속이지만, 약속은 약속이다. “오늘부터 내 방에서 잘 거예요.” 나는 또박또박 말을 하고 책상만 덩그러니 있는 내 방으로 걸어갔다. 엄마와 아빠가 놀라 뒤따랐다. “성국아, 진짜 혼자 잘 거야?” “네에!” 엄마와 아빠가 상의하는 소리가 뒤에서 들렸다. “소영아, 우선 이불 깔아주자. 문 좀 열어두고. 자다가 무서우면 오겠지.” “갑자기 왜 저러지?” “낮에 무슨 일 있었어?” “아니….” 나는 홀로 어둑한 방에 섰다. 조명 스위치는 내 손에 닿지 않았다. 하지만 난 하나도 무섭지 않았다. 저번 생에서는 돌이 갓 지나자마자 홀로 방을 썼다. [이 어둠에도 익숙해져야겠지.] 나는 쓸쓸히 베개를 꼭 안았다. 달칵. 불이 곧 켜졌다. 엄마와 아빠가 이불을 가지고 와서 덮어줬다. 엄마는 걱정스러운 얼굴로 다시 한번 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 진짜 혼자 잘 수 있겠어?” “…….” 나는 말 대신 비장하게 고개를 끄덕였다. [남자든 여자든 한 번 한 약속은 지켜야 하는 거야, 엄마.] 나는 베개를 꼭 껴안았다. 엄마와 아빠는 차례대로 나를 꼭 안더니 방문을 살짝 열어두고 나갔다. “성국아, 무서우면 안방으로 와.” 도리도리. [그럴 일은 이제 없을 거야.] 곧 불도 꺼졌다. 나는 어둠 속에 누워서 천장을 바라봤다. 이제 엄마 옆자리는 동생인 민국이에게 물려줬다. 나도 모르게 눈물이 주르륵 흐르더니 베갯잇을 적셨다. [이렇게 또 어른이 되는 거겠지.] “흐윽-.” 나는 터져 나오는 울음을 꾹 참았다. * * * 월요일 유치원이 끝날 시각, 양 비서 아저씨가 밖에서 기다리는 게 보였다. 엄마가 양 비서 아저씨가 데리러 갈 것이라고 이미 말해둔 상태라 나는 의심 없이 양 비서 아저씨의 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 유치원 어떠니?” 양 비서 아저씨는 차분한 목소리로 물었다. 나는 삼전 그룹이 베풀어준 은혜를 잊지 않고 있음을 알리는 짧은 대답을 했다. “재미있어요.” “그래? 친구들은 많이 사귀었니?” “네에!” 나는 자신 있게 대답했다. [그냥 애들이랑 안면 좀 튼 거지.] 지금이야 내가 외국어도 잘하고, 지들보다 똑똑한 줄 아니까 더는 나를 무시하지 못하지만, 자신들의 사회적 지위와 재산이 어느 정도인지 인지하고 나면 저들은 나를 찬밥 취급할 것이다. 그 전에 내 재산도 사회적 지위도 올려야 한다. “성국아, 아빠 가게 가서 저녁 먹을까?” “보쌈 맛있어요.” 나는 얼른 양 비서의 차에 올라탔다. 양 비서의 차 역시 손에 꼽히는 명차였다. 서민들이야 비서라고 하면 전재형 회장의 자잘한 일이나 뒤치다꺼리하는 사람으로 안다. 하지만 양 비서는 삼전 그룹에서 독보적인 위치를 가지고 있는 직책 중 하나이다. 삼전 계열사 대표들과 연봉도 엇비슷했지만, 양 비서에게 주어진 특권은 더 어마어마했다. 이 차와 집. 그리고 살면서 누릴 수 있는 각종 혜택이 있었다. 그래서 양 비서의 절대복종도 가능한 일인지 모른다. 양 비서는 차에 준비된 유기농 바나나를 간식으로 내밀었다. “성국이 바나나 좋아하지?” “감사합니다.” 나는 다소곳하게 바나나를 들었다. [저번 생에서 즐겨 먹던 유기농 바나나네.] 나는 히죽거리며 바나나를 한 입 깨물었다. 차 안에서는 쇼팽의 피아노 연주곡이 들려왔다. [이건 조성원 연주인데….] “어….” 내가 놀란 표정을 짓자 양 비서는 면밀하게 살폈다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “이거. 이 음악.” “응. 이 음악이 왜?” “쇼팽.” “성국이는 이 음악을 어떻게 알아?” 양 비서는 차분하게 물었다. 그제야 나는 이 모든 게 계획된 것이라는 사실을 깨달았다. 일부러 조성원의 피아노 연주곡을 틀었고, 내가 음악에 얼마나 민감한지 보는 거였다. 지금부터 모든 게 테스트였다. 아니, 나를 피아니스트로 만들기 위한 스태프 중 하나였다. 나는 숨을 골랐다. 나의 피아노 실력은 나도 잘 안다. 저번 생에서 아주 잠시 피아니스트가 되어 전 세계를 돌며 연주회를 여는 꿈을 꾸기도 했다. 하지만 나의 재능은 그것에 한참 모자랐다. 서울의 어느 대학이나 유학까지 무난한 실력으로 갈 수 있지만, 집안의 입김이 작용하지 않는 외국의 콩쿠르에서 수상할 실력은 안 됐다. 아마 이번 생에서도 마찬가지일 것이다. “아저띠.” 나는 양 비서를 불렀다. “왜, 성국아?” “피아노 좋아요.” “정말?” “네. 근데요.” “근데?” 양 비서의 옆으로 작은 녹음기가 보였다. “피아노보다 공부가 더 좋아요. 공부가 재미있어요. 헤에.” “그래….” 양 비서는 인자한 미소를 지으며 고개를 끄덕였다. 어느새 아빠의 보쌈 가게가 저 멀리 보였다. * * * 가게 한 자리에는 이미 테이블이 세팅되어 있었다. 아빠표 보쌈과 반찬들. 그리고 소주까지. 오랜만에 김미영 매니저도 보였다. 아침에 학교 가면서 엄마에게 김미영 매니저가 보고 싶다고 슬쩍 흘렸다. 엄마는 양 비서를 만나는데 김미영 매니저도 오면 좋을 것 같다며 부리나케 연락을 했다. 엄마, 아빠가 좋은 사람들이고 이제 슬슬 사회적인 경험도 쌓이긴 했지만, 삼전에게 잔뼈가 굵은 김미영이 있으면 좀 더 유리하게 대화를 끌고 나갈 수 있을 거 같았다. 돌아가신 전주신 회장께서는 이런 말을 종종 하셨다. “회의 테이블에 우리 편은 많으면 많을수록 좋은 법이야.”","completion":"Episode 35 \\"Could you please elaborate a bit more?\\" The Iron Lady barely managed to calm her racing heart before asking. Jo Seong-won began to speak about Seong-guk playing the piano, his face dreamy as if he was in a trance. \\"I first played the piano when I was five years old. Sitting in front of the piano and looking at the keys, I just felt incredibly happy. Every time I pressed a key, I couldn't help but smile. I saw that same expression on Seong-guk.\\" Jo Seong-won didn't go into detail. The fact that Seong-guk's fingers were longer and more flexible than those of his peers. And also, when he had Seong-guk play a scale he had played as a test earlier, Seong-guk had perfect pitch. Such things would only hurt the mother of a child who wants to learn art as a hobby or a specialty. The Iron Lady nodded slightly. \\"Thank you for sharing. I know you must be busy with the concert next week, so I appreciate the lessons as well.\\" \\"I'm more thankful for your constant support.\\" Jo Seong-won was also one of the talents sponsored by the Samjeon Group. The Iron Lady hesitated for a moment before looking back at Jo Seong-won. \\"I'm sorry, but do you know any teachers who could teach Seong-guk?\\" Jo Seong-won looked at the Iron Lady with a puzzled expression. \\"Why would you ask...\\" \\"Seong-guk is actually a child sponsored by our Samjeon Group. If he has talent, we'd like to nurture it.\\" \\"If it's okay with you, I'd like to recommend my childhood piano teacher. Thanks to them, I was able to maintain my interest in the piano and learn a solid foundation.\\" \\"I'll look into it.\\" The Iron Lady exchanged greetings with Jo Seong-won with a light heart and headed to her car. If Seong-guk had talent in piano, then nurturing it was the right thing to do. If that happens, Seong-guk would simply become a famous pianist, and Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung would no longer have any regrets about Seong-guk. * * * \\"I like curry. I like food.\\" I danced a little shoulder dance with a spoon in hand, in front of the curry my mom made. [Ha, I never thought I'd come to like this cheap-tasting curry.] It was something I couldn't even dream of in my past life. But the curry my mom made was the second most delicious thing in the world after the Samjeon Hotel's black bean noodles. \\"Seong-guk, eat slowly.\\" \\"I will eat well!\\" I quickly shoved the curry into my mouth. [It's delicious as expected.] The shoulder dance came naturally. Then, the house phone rang loudly. Mom quickly wiped her wet hands and answered the phone. \\"Secretary Yang, how have you been?\\" [Why did Secretary Yang call?] \\"Seong-guk's career consultation? Yes. Next Monday is my husband's day off. Understood.\\" Mom hung up the phone and tilted her head. \\"Seong-guk, did something happen at kindergarten?\\" [Hmm…] I shook my head first. But I definitely knew one thing that happened at kindergarten. Meeting Jo Seong-won. And the Iron Lady watching it. I had a bit of a guess about what the Iron Lady was thinking. [Is she planning to make me a pianist?] The Iron Lady would be more than capable of doing so. She wasn't a warm mother, but she cleared anything that hindered her child's future. \\"Seong-guk, mom will hang the laundry and come back. Can you watch Min-guk for a bit?\\" \\"Yes. Mom, come back quickly.\\" \\"Mom will give you a banana when I come back.\\" \\"Yes!\\" After eating, I watched Min-guk, who was spinning around in the living room. He hadn't read a single line of a book, had no interest in the news, and all he did was eat, poop, and play. I looked at Min-guk with pity. [What are you going to be when you grow up? Even if your brother earns a lot of money, you need to earn money too. A healthy person shouldn't just play. Got it?] \\"Hyung.\\" Min-guk came to me, pushed his face close, and rubbed his cheek against mine. Whenever I lectured him these days, he always came to me and pushed his face close. [Go away. I'm speaking nicely.] \\"Hyung.\\" Min-guk just laughed with a short tongue sound. [I'm really worried about this guy's future.] \\"Sigh-.\\" I was already worried about Min-guk's future. Would this guy grow up to be decent? Whether he knew about my heavy heart or not, Min-guk hugged me and laughed happily. \\"Hyung. Good.\\" [I don't like you that much. You're not a competitor anymore; you're a burden in my life, a burden.] I looked down at Min-guk with drooping shoulders. \\"Min-guk. Do you like your brother?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"Because you're my brother.\\" My heart felt warm. In this life, it seemed like my heart was broken. I was moved by such a trivial thing. [Alright, I'll hug you once. Come here.] Min-guk hugged me tightly. The scent of baby powder wafted from Min-guk's body. [Ah, I guess I need to plan this guy's future too.] I looked at Min-guk sternly. \\"Jeon Min-guk, you have to listen to me well. Got it?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Min-guk smiled brightly. [Hm… I forgot because I was attending kindergarten, but this guy is kind of cute. Not as much as me, but with that face, he could do anything.] His smiling face was quite cute, and although he was dumber than me, he understood what was said. There was nothing more important for a child model or actor. \\"Seong-guk, you were playing well with Min-guk. Mom will quickly give you a banana.\\" \\"Mom!\\" I called out to mom. \\"Why, Seong-guk?\\" \\"Min-guk. Let's try Min-guk as a child actor.\\" \\"What?\\" Mom looked at me in surprise. \\"Min-guk is good at acting. He smiles well.\\" \\"Min-guk does, but…\\" \\"Seong-guk, is that what you think?\\" Of course, it was my idea, but if I said it was my idea, it would be hard to persuade mom. \\"Min-guk said so.\\" \\"Min-guk did?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I nodded firmly. Mom grabbed Min-guk's shoulder and looked into his eyes. \\"Min-guk, do you want to be a child model?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Min-guk answered loudly. In fact, I had told him a little earlier that if he just said yes to mom's words, he would give up his spot next to mom when sleeping. * * * That night, I got up with a pillow in my arms. Mom and dad looked at me strangely as they were about to sleep. \\"Seong-guk, can't you sleep?\\" Dad approached me to hug me. I stepped back. \\"Seong-guk, what's wrong?\\" \\"Dad, I want to sleep alone.\\" \\"Suddenly? Now?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I looked down at Min-guk, who had already taken my spot next to mom and was lying down. Even though it was a promise with a three-year-old, a promise is a promise. \\"From today, I'll sleep in my room.\\" I spoke clearly and walked to my room, which only had a desk. Mom and dad followed me in surprise. \\"Seong-guk, are you really going to sleep alone?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I heard mom and dad discussing behind me. \\"So-young, let's lay down a blanket for now. Leave the door a bit open. If he gets scared, he'll come.\\" \\"Why is he acting like this all of a sudden?\\" \\"Did something happen during the day?\\" \\"No…\\" I stood alone in the dark room. The light switch was out of my reach. But I wasn't scared at all. In my past life, I had my own room just after turning one. [I'll have to get used to this darkness too.] I hugged the pillow sadly. Click. The light turned on. Mom and dad came in with a blanket and covered me. Mom looked at me worriedly one more time. \\"Seong-guk, are you sure you can sleep alone?\\" \\"…….\\" Instead of speaking, I nodded solemnly. [Whether you're a man or a woman, you have to keep a promise once made, mom.] I hugged the pillow tightly. Mom and dad hugged me in turn, then left the room slightly open and left. \\"Seong-guk, if you're scared, come to the main room.\\" I shook my head. [There won't be such a thing anymore.] Soon the light went out. I lay in the darkness, looking at the ceiling. I had given up my spot next to mom to my younger brother Min-guk. Tears streamed down my face, wetting the pillowcase. [This is how I become an adult again.] \\"Huuk-.\\" I held back the tears that burst out. * * * On Monday, when kindergarten was about to end, I saw Secretary Yang waiting outside. Since mom had already told me that Secretary Yang would pick me up, I took his hand without suspicion. \\"Seong-guk, how's kindergarten?\\" Secretary Yang asked in a calm voice. I gave a short answer, indicating that I hadn't forgotten the grace bestowed by the Samjeon Group. \\"It's fun.\\" \\"Really? Did you make a lot of friends?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I answered confidently. [I just got a bit familiar with the kids.] Now, because I can speak foreign languages well and they know I'm smarter than them, they can't ignore me anymore. But once they realize their social status and wealth, they will treat me like cold rice. Before that, I need to raise my own wealth and social status. \\"Seong-guk, shall we go to dad's restaurant for dinner?\\" \\"Bossam is delicious.\\" I quickly got into Secretary Yang's car. Secretary Yang's car was also one of the top luxury cars. Ordinary people think of a secretary as someone who takes care of Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's trivial matters. However, Secretary Yang held one of the most unique positions in the Samjeon Group. His salary was similar to that of the CEOs of Samjeon's subsidiaries, but the privileges given to Secretary Yang were even more enormous. This car and house. And various benefits he could enjoy in life. That's why Secretary Yang's absolute obedience was possible. Secretary Yang handed me an organic banana prepared in the car as a snack. \\"Seong-guk likes bananas, right?\\" \\"Thank you.\\" I took the banana gracefully. [It's the organic banana I used to enjoy in my previous life.] I grinned and bit into the banana. Chopin's piano concerto played in the car. [This is Jo Seong-won's performance….] \\"Uh…\\" When I looked surprised, Secretary Yang scrutinized me closely. \\"Seong-guk, what's wrong?\\" \\"This music.\\" \\"Yes. What about this music?\\" \\"Chopin.\\" \\"How does Seong-guk know this music?\\" Secretary Yang asked calmly. Then I realized that all of this was planned. They deliberately played Jo Seong-won's piano concerto to see how sensitive I was to music. From now on, everything was a test. No, it was one of the steps to make me a pianist. I took a deep breath. I know my piano skills well. In my previous life, I briefly dreamed of becoming a pianist and touring the world for concerts. However, my talent was far from enough. I could go to any university in Seoul or even study abroad with my skills, but I wasn't good enough to win awards in international competitions where family influence didn't matter. It would probably be the same in this life. \\"Secretary.\\" I called Secretary Yang. \\"Yes, Seong-guk?\\" \\"I like the piano.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes. But.\\" \\"But?\\" A small recorder was visible next to Secretary Yang. \\"I like studying more than the piano. Studying is fun. Hehe.\\" \\"Is that so…\\" Secretary Yang smiled kindly and nodded. Soon, dad's bossam restaurant appeared in the distance. * * * A table was already set at the restaurant. Dad's bossam and side dishes. And even soju. Kim Mi-young, the manager, was also there after a long time. I casually mentioned to mom in the morning that I wanted to see Manager Kim Mi-young. Mom thought it would be good to have Manager Kim Mi-young there when meeting Secretary Yang, so she hurriedly contacted her. Mom and dad are good people, and I've gradually gained social experience, but having Kim Mi-young, who has a lot of experience with Samjeon, would make it easier to lead the conversation more advantageously. The late Chairman Jeon Ju-shin often said this. \\"The more allies we have at the negotiation table, the better.\\""},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[전미진 껌딱지 때문에 귀찮지만, 영어랑 프랑스어 쓰는 건 엄청 좋아. 선생님들이 이제 내 수준을 좀 못 따라오는 것 같긴 한데. 다들 착해서 조정하기는 편해.] 아빠가 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 아빠가 한 보쌈 먹자.” “와아! 배고파요. 아빠!” “어서 앉아. 양 비서님도 앉으세요. 마저 음식 좀 가지고 올게요.” “참, 저희 회사 사람들 주게 보쌈 세트 열 개만 포장해주실 수 있죠? 일 마치고 들어가는 길에 야근하는 친구들 주게요.” “그럼, 준비할게요.” “우선 성국이 이야기 하고 준비해 주세요. 아버지도 이야기를 들으셔야죠.” 아빠는 앞치마를 벗고 테이블에 앉았다. 아빠와 엄마, 김미영 매니저와 나. 구석에 유모차에서 버둥거리는 민국이까지. 전주신 회장의 말대로 지금 나에게는 양 비서를 상대할 내 편이 많았다. 아빠가 얼른 양 비서의 잔에 소주를 따랐다. “한 잔 괜찮으시죠?” “보쌈에 소주 빠지면 안 그래도 서운할 뻔했어요.” 양 비서의 주량은 소주 반 병. 물론 이건 대외적으로 알려진 주량이다. 사실 양 비서는 소주 네다섯 병도 너끈히 마시지만 언제나 긴장을 놓을 수 없기 때문에 밖에서는 적당히 마시는 타입이었다. 꿀꺽. 양 비서는 첫 잔을 깨끗하게 비웠다. “성국이 아버지 보쌈은 언제 먹어도 맛있네요. 혹시 앞으로 사업 확장 같은 거 하실 생각 없으세요?” “고객들에게 인정받는 게 제일 먼저잖아요. 점점 고객이 늘고 있긴 하지만, 아직 초창기라서요.” “성국이가 아이답지 않게 신중한 면이 있는데, 아버님을 닮은 거군요.” 양 비서는 나를 보며 웃었다. [양 비서, 웃지만 말고 이제 속내를 드러내야지. 언제까지 보쌈만 먹고 있을 거야?] “참, 제가 오늘 이렇게 보자고 한 거는요. 말씀드렸다시피 성국 군 교육 문제 때문인데요….” 양 비서는 잠시 뜸을 들였다. 좀 전의 차 안에서 나눈 내용으로 누군가와 통화하는 것 같았다. 철의 여인이겠지? 나는 턱을 매만졌다. “이런 말씀 드리려니 쑥스럽네요. 성국 군 교육에 저희가 너무 많이 참여하는 것 같아서요.” [내 말이. 양 비서, 선 넘지 말자고.] 나는 팔짱을 딱 꼈다. “사실은 성국 군이 남다른 능력을 가지고 있다는 것을 주변에서 익히 들었습니다. 가르치신 선생님들의 말씀도 한결같이 성국 군이 다른 아이들보다 월등히 뛰어나다고 말씀해 주시고요.” [이런 말 너무 들어도 지겹군. 자, 어서 본론을 말해보라고, 양 비서.] “제가 드리는 의견은 의견일 뿐이니 참고하시라는 것만 알려 드리겠습니다.” “편하게 말씀해 주세요.” 아빠는 얼른 양 비서의 빈 잔에 소주를 다시 채웠다. 양 비서는 소주를 반쯤 마시고는 입을 열었다. “전재형 회장님께서.” [철의 여인 아니고?] “전재형 회장님께서 성국 군의 미국 유학을 조심스레 추천하셨습니다.” [뭐라고!] 이건 전혀 예상치 못한 내용이었다. 나는 오늘 양 비서를 당연히 철의 여인이 보냈을 것이라고 여겼다. 그것도 피아노 영재로 나를 키워보려는 속셈으로. 그런데 지금 양 비서는 전재형 회장의 말을 전하고 있었다. 엄마와 아빠, 김미영 매니저 모두 놀란 눈치였다. “양 비서님, 성국이 유학을 보내 주시겠다는 말씀이세요?” “물론 부모님이 허락하시면요. 아시다시피 우리나라 아직 영재교육은 미비한 수준이지 않습니까. 성국 군 같은 인재를 좀 더 큰물에서 교육 시켜야 하는 게 맞다고 보시는 거죠. 곧 회장님 자녀분인 전미진 양과 전태국 군이 미국으로 유학을 가거든요. 그때 제 아들과 함께 가는데, 성국 군도 같이 가면 어떨지 회장님께서 조심스레 제안하셨습니다.” 아빠와 엄마는 조금 혼란스러운 얼굴이었다. 물론 나에게는 혼란이란 없었다. 내 의견은 단호했다. “싫어요.” “성국아, 싫어?” 엄마가 조심스레 물었다. “네에! 엄마, 아빠랑 떨어지기 싫어요.” 이건 표면적인 이유였고, 유학이라는 거 가봤자 내가 배울 건 별로 없었다. 이미 저번 생에서 지겹도록 한 게 유학 생활이었다. 거기다 전태국이랑 전미진과 함께라니. 그 꼴통들과는 어디도 같이 가고 싶지 않았다. 양 비서는 소주잔을 마저 비웠다. “성국이 의견이 단호하네요.” “양 비서님, 성국이 유학을 지원하신다는 것은 미국에서의 영재교육을 말씀하시는 거죠?” 김미영 매니저가 조심스레 물었다. “물론입니다. 우선 한 1년 정도는 적응 시간을 거쳐야 하겠지만, 성국 군의 지금 실력이라면 좀 더 단축될 수도 있을 겁니다. 그다음에 미국의 영재교육 프로그램에 성국 군을 입학시킬 예정입니다.” [뭐야! 다 계획했네, 했어.] 나는 쀼루퉁한 얼굴로 양 비서를 바라봤다. “성국 군이 훌륭한 인재로 자라만 준다면 저희 삼전 쪽에서는 무척 기쁜 일이거든요.” “말씀은 감사합니다. 너무 갑작스러운 제안이라 아무래도 좀 고민의 시간이 필요할 것 같습니다.” “물론이시죠. 이번 달 말까지 고민의 시간 드리면 될까요? 유학 절차를 밟으려면 그 정도 시간은 있어야 해서요.” “네, 그럴게요. 성국이 의견도 중요하고요.” “성국 군은 유학을 안 가더라고 여기서도 분명 뛰어난 인재로 성장할 겁니다.” [난 이미 뛰어난 인재라고. 걱정 마, 양 비서.] * * * 나는 베개를 안고 일부러 엄마, 아빠, 민국이가 자는 방으로 갔다. 오늘은 아무래도 여기 구석에서 자면서 엄마, 아빠 대화를 엿들어야 할 것 같았다. 민국이 녀석은 이미 곯아떨어져 있었다. 나는 민국이 옆에 베개를 놓고 누웠다. “성국아, 오늘은 여기서 자게?” 엄마가 내 배를 도닥였다. “응.” “그래, 오늘은 우리 네 식구 모두 여기서 자자.” 막 씻고 나온 아빠가 수면등만 켠 채 안방의 불을 껐다. 이 좁은 방에서 네 식구가 자다니. 저번 생에서는 정말 상상도 못 한 일이었다. 민국이 녀석이 몸부림을 치면서 자꾸 팔로 내 얼굴과 배를 가격했지만, 참을 만했다. [이게 다 사람 사는 거지.] 나는 스르르 눈을 감았다. 잠은 오지 않았지만, 자는 척을 해야 엄마, 아빠가 대화를 시작할 것 같아서였다. “성국이 자나 봐.” 엄마가 소곤거리는 목소리가 들렸다. “소영아, 아까 양 비서님이 하신 말씀 있잖아. 어떻게 생각해?” “솔직히 너무 갑작스러워서 아무 생각이 안 나.” [엄마, 아빠. 나 키우면서 이런 일 앞으로 수두룩할 거야. 각오들 좀 해.] 턱. 민국이의 팔이 내 얼굴을 또 가격했다. [해보자는 거지?] 나는 몸부림치는 척 다리를 민국이의 다리에 툭 올려놨다. 그러자 민국이의 몸부림이 잦아졌다. “소영아, 성국이를 이렇게 어린 나이에 미국 유학을 보내도 될까 싶어. 심지어 그 재벌 집 아이들이랑 섞여서.” [난 싫다고 말했어, 아빠.] “성국이도 싫다고 하고. 이렇게 뛰어난 아이이니 여기서도 잘해줄 것 같지만, 양 비서님 말대로 큰물을 접해보는 것도 좋지 않을까 싶기도 하고. 너무 좋은 기회 같아서 망설여지네.” [엄마, 저번 생에서 오대양 육대주, 내가 안 밟아본 데가 없다고 말했던가.] “우리가 배운 게 너무 없어서 성국이 교육을 제대로 못 시키나 고민되네.” [아빠, 난 알아서 잘 크니까 걱정 말래두.] 턱. 민국이 이 녀석이 다시 다리를 내게 올려놨다. 나는 몸부림치는 척 다시 민국이를 제압했다. “소영아, 성국이랑 민국이 좀 봐.” “성국이 민국이 챙길 때 보면 정말 형 같아.” [엄마, 인생의 짐이라서 챙기는 거야. 더 큰 짐이 될까 봐.] 아빠의 낮은 한숨 소리가 연이어 들렸다. “시간 좀 있으니 성국이 의견이랑 김미영 매니저 의견도 들어보자.” “성국이 미래 생각하면 너무 좋은 기회인데. 또 이렇게 어린 애를 미국에 혼자 어떻게 보내. 아무리 요즘 해외여행 자유화라지만, 우리가 미국 가기 쉽지 않을 거잖아. 자기야, 나 성국이 보고 싶어서 맨날 울 것 같아.” 엄마는 아빠 품에 폭 안겼다. 저번 생에서 아버지와 어머니는 언제나 내 미래가 우선이었다. 한국에서 엘리트 코스를 밟으면서도 틈틈이 해외에 수행원들과 나갔다. 바쁜 부모님이 나를 따라갈 일은 없었다. 보고 싶다는 말로 내가 마음이 약해질까 봐 그런 말도 하지 않았다. 하지만 이 젊은 엄마와 아빠는 벌써 내가 보고 싶다고 눈물을 흘리고 있었다. [이게 평범한 가정이겠지.] 나는 씁쓸한 마음을 달래며 민국이를 껴안았다. [동생, 나 좀 위로해줘.] “혀엉. 혀엉.” 민국이는 잠결에도 나를 찾으며 안겼다. 만약 미국으로 유학을 간다면 평생 처음 가져본 이 안락함을 포기해야 하는 거겠지? 나는 입을 앙다물었다. * * * “성국아!” 엄마의 놀란 목소리가 잠결에 들렸다. 어젯밤에 씁쓸함을 달래느라 늦게 잠들어서 늦잠을 잔 모양이었다. [어, 이 축축함은 뭐지?] 특히 바지 쪽이 축축했다. 엄마가 얼른 나를 일으켰다. “성국아, 일어날 수 있지?” “응!” 나는 손으로 눈을 비벼댔다. [민국이, 이 녀석. 오줌을 싼 모양이네.] 나는 민국이를 발로 툭툭 쳤다. 그런데! 민국이의 바지는 뽀송뽀송했다. [설마… 내가 싼 거야?] 나는 얼른 바지를 만졌다. 팬티까지 아주 흠뻑 젖어 있었다. 엄마는 젖은 물수건을 가져오더니 내 몸을 닦았다. “안 되겠다. 성국아, 욕실 가서 샤워하자.” “엄…마.” 나는 놀란 목소리로 엄마를 찾았다. “괜찮아. 우리 성국이가 많이 피곤했나 보네.” 엄마는 나를 꼭 안아 들고는 욕실로 걸어갔다. 나는 엄마의 어깨에 얼굴을 콕 박았다. 이건 전성국 인생 최대의 쪽팔림이었다. [내가 오줌을 싸다니! 내가! 이 전성국이!] “성국이 이 녀석, 다 큰 줄 알았더니 아직도 오줌싸개잖아.” 아빠가 놀리듯 다가왔다. [아빠, 조용히 해!] 귓불까지 붉게 타올랐다. “성국아, 아빠도 사실 초등학교 1학년 때까지 밤에 오줌 쌌어. 그땐 고아원 원장 선생님이 얼마나 혼내던지. 무서워 죽는 줄 알았네.” “자기야, 성국이 놀리지 마.” 엄마는 얼른 내 옷을 벗기더니 따뜻한 물로 내 온몸을 씻겼다. 이런 치욕은 태어나서 처음이었다. 기저귀를 뗀 이후로는 용변은 타이밍에 맞춰서 조절했다. 가끔 어려울 때도 있었지만, 밤에 자면서 이불이 다 젖게 오줌을 싼 건 다섯 살 인생, 아니 전생까지 합쳐도 처음 있는 일이었다. “소영아, 아무래도 안 되겠어.” “뭐가?” “밤에 오줌 싸는 이 녀석을 어떻게 미국에 혼자 보내. 나 어릴 적에 고아원 원장 선생님한테 혼날 때 정말 서러웠어. 엄마, 아빠가 있었어도 나한테 이렇게 혼냈을까. 그런 생각도 들고. 부모 없는 게 어린 나이에도 정말 서러웠다니까. 우리 성국이도 미국 가서 혼자 지내다가 실수라도 하면 우리가 못 지켜주잖아.” [아빠, 뭔 소리야. 여태까지 내가 엄마, 아빠 지켜준 거잖아.] “으이구, 이 오줌싸개. 너 좀 더 커서 미국 가자. 성국이 혼자서도 다 알아서 해결할 때까지, 아빠랑 엄마가 옆에서 꼭 붙어서 지켜줄게. 알았지?” 뭉클. 또 눈시울이 붉어지기 시작했다. [이 철없는 어린 엄마, 아빠야! 왜 니들이 날 지키냐고! 내가 지킨다고!] “흐어엉-.” 속마음과 달리 눈물이 앞을 가렸다. “자기야, 저리 가. 아침이나 차려줘. 성국이 창피해서 울잖아.” 나는 엄마에게 푹 안겼다. 엄마는 연신 내 등을 도닥였다. “성국아, 괜찮아. 아빠가 놀리느라 그러는 거야. 우리 성국이가 평소에 안 하는 짓 하니까. 이제 오줌 안 쌀 거지?” “엄마.” 나는 훌쩍이며 엄마를 불렀다. “성국이, 서러웠어?” “엄마, 나 지켜줄 거야?” “당연하지. 엄마랑 아빠는 성국이 지켜주려고 이 세상에 존재하는 사람들이야. 알지?” “응!” 나는 눈물을 꾹 참으며 엄마에게 안겼다.","completion":"Episode 36 I ran to my mom and hugged her. \\"Mom, I'm back.\\" \\"Sung-guk, was kindergarten fun?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Behind those words was this meaning: [It was annoying because of Jeon Mi-jin sticking around, but I really like using English and French. It seems like the teachers can't quite keep up with me now. But everyone is nice, so they're easy to manage.] Dad patted my head. \\"Sung-guk, let's eat some bossam.\\" \\"Wow! I'm hungry, Dad!\\" \\"Come on, sit down. Secretary Yang, please take a seat too. I'll bring the rest of the food.\\" \\"By the way, can you pack ten sets of bossam for the people at our company? I'll give them to my colleagues working late on my way home.\\" \\"Sure, I'll prepare it.\\" \\"First, let's hear Sung-guk's story and get ready. Father should listen too.\\" Dad took off his apron and sat at the table. Dad, mom, Manager Kim Mi-young, and me. Even Min-guk, who was fussing in the stroller in the corner. As Chairman Jeon Joo-shin said, I now had many allies to deal with Secretary Yang. Dad quickly poured soju for Secretary Yang. \\"One drink is okay, right?\\" \\"It would have been disappointing without soju with bossam.\\" Secretary Yang's tolerance was half a bottle of soju. Of course, this was the publicly known tolerance. In reality, Secretary Yang could easily drink four or five bottles of soju, but she always had to stay alert, so she drank moderately outside. Gulp. Secretary Yang cleanly emptied her first glass. \\"Sung-guk's father's bossam is always delicious. Have you ever thought about expanding the business?\\" \\"Being recognized by customers comes first. The number of customers is gradually increasing, but it's still early days.\\" \\"Sung-guk has a cautious side that's unlike a child, must have taken after you.\\" Secretary Yang smiled at me. [Secretary Yang, don't just smile, show your true intentions. How long are you going to just eat bossam?] \\"Actually, the reason I asked to see you today is about Sung-guk's education...\\" Secretary Yang paused for a moment. It seemed like she was recalling a conversation she had in the car earlier. The iron lady, right? I stroked my chin. \\"It's a bit embarrassing to say this. It seems like we're too involved in Sung-guk's education.\\" [That's what I'm saying. Secretary Yang, let's not cross the line.] I crossed my arms firmly. \\"In fact, it's widely known that Sung-guk has exceptional abilities. The teachers also unanimously say that Sung-guk is far superior to other children.\\" [I'm tired of hearing such things. Now, let's get to the point, Secretary Yang.] \\"I'm just offering my opinion for your reference.\\" \\"Please feel free to speak.\\" Dad quickly refilled Secretary Yang's empty glass with soju. After drinking half of the soju, Secretary Yang spoke. \\"Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung.\\" [Not the iron lady?] \\"Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung cautiously recommended that Sung-guk study in the US.\\" [What!] This was completely unexpected. I had assumed that Secretary Yang was sent by the iron lady, intending to raise me as a piano prodigy. But now, Secretary Yang was conveying Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's words. Mom, dad, and Manager Kim Mi-young all looked surprised. \\"Secretary Yang, are you saying you'll send Sung-guk to study abroad?\\" \\"Of course, if the parents agree. As you know, our country's education for gifted children is still lacking. It's right to educate a talent like Sung-guk in a bigger pond, as he sees it. Soon, Chairman's children, Jeon Mi-jin and Jeon Tae-guk, will go to study in the US. He cautiously suggested that it might be good for Sung-guk to go with his son.\\" Dad and mom looked a bit confused. Of course, I was clear about my opinion. \\"I don't want to.\\" \\"Sung-guk, you don't want to?\\" Mom asked gently. \\"Yes! I don't want to be away from mom and dad.\\" This was the superficial reason, but there wasn't much for me to learn from studying abroad. I had already experienced enough of studying abroad in my previous life. Moreover, with Jeon Tae-guk and Jeon Mi-jin. I didn't want to go anywhere with those troublemakers. Secretary Yang finished her glass of soju. \\"Sung-guk's opinion is firm.\\" \\"Secretary Yang, when you say supporting Sung-guk's study abroad, you mean the gifted education in the US, right?\\" Manager Kim Mi-young cautiously asked. \\"Of course. At first, there will be about a year of adaptation, but given Sung-guk's current abilities, it might be shortened. After that, we plan to enroll Sung-guk in a US gifted education program.\\" [What! They've planned everything.] I looked at Secretary Yang with a pouty face. \\"If Sung-guk grows up to be an excellent talent, it would be a very happy thing for our Samjeon side.\\" \\"Thank you for your words. It's such a sudden proposal that we'll need some time to think.\\" \\"Of course. Can I give you until the end of this month to think? We need that much time to proceed with the study abroad process.\\" \\"Yes, we'll do that. Sung-guk's opinion is important too.\\" \\"Sung-guk will surely grow into an outstanding talent even if he doesn't go abroad.\\" [I'm already an outstanding talent. Don't worry, Secretary Yang.] * * * I took a pillow and deliberately went to the room where mom, dad, and Min-guk were sleeping. It seemed like I had to eavesdrop on mom and dad's conversation by sleeping here in the corner today. Min-guk was already fast asleep. I placed a pillow next to Min-guk and lay down. \\"Sung-guk, are you sleeping here today?\\" Mom patted my stomach. \\"Yeah.\\" \\"Alright, let's all four of us sleep here today.\\" Dad, who had just taken a shower, turned off the lights in the master bedroom, leaving only the night light on. Sleeping in this small room with four people was something I couldn't even imagine in my previous life. Min-guk kept hitting my face and stomach with his arms as he thrashed around, but it was bearable. [This is what living with people is all about.] I closed my eyes. I wasn't sleepy, but I pretended to sleep so mom and dad would start talking. \\"Sung-guk seems to be asleep.\\" Mom whispered. \\"Soyoung, about what Secretary Yang said earlier. What do you think?\\" \\"Honestly, it's so sudden I can't think of anything.\\" [Mom, dad. Raising me will bring many more events like this. Be prepared.] Thump. Min-guk's arm hit my face again. [Are you challenging me?] Pretending to thrash around, I lightly placed my leg on Min-guk's leg, and his thrashing subsided. \\"Soyoung, I'm not sure if it's okay to send Sung-guk to study in the US at such a young age. Especially mixing with those chaebol kids.\\" [I said I didn't want to, dad.] \\"Sung-guk also said no. It seems like a good opportunity considering his future, but I'm also hesitant because it's such a great opportunity.\\" [Mom, I've stepped on every continent in my previous life.] \\"We're too uneducated to properly educate Sung-guk.\\" [Dad, I'll grow up fine on my own, so don't worry.] Thump. Min-guk's leg landed on me again. Pretending to thrash, I subdued Min-guk once more. \\"Soyoung, look at Sung-guk and Min-guk.\\" \\"When Sung-guk takes care of Min-guk, he really seems like a big brother.\\" [Mom, I'm taking care of him because he's a burden. I don't want him to become a bigger burden.] Dad sighed deeply. \\"Let's take some time to think and also hear from Sung-guk and Manager Kim Mi-young.\\" \\"It's such a good opportunity for Sung-guk's future. But how can we send such a young child to the US alone? Even with the liberalization of overseas travel, it won't be easy for us to go to the US. Honey, I think I'll cry every day missing Sung-guk.\\" Mom hugged dad tightly. In my previous life, my parents always prioritized my future. Even while following the elite course in Korea, I occasionally went abroad with attendants. Busy parents never followed me. They didn't say they missed me, thinking it might weaken me. But these young parents were already shedding tears, missing me. [This must be what a normal family is like.] I hugged Min-guk to comfort my bitter heart. [Brother, comfort me.] \\"Huh. Huh.\\" Even in his sleep, Min-guk reached out for me. If I were to study in the US, would I have to give up this comfort I've experienced for the first time in my life? I clenched my lips. * * * \\"Sung-guk!\\" Mom's surprised voice woke me up. I must have overslept because I fell asleep late, comforting my bitterness. [Oh, what's this dampness?] Especially around my pants, it was damp. Mom quickly lifted me up. \\"Sung-guk, can you get up?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I rubbed my eyes. [Min-guk, this kid. He must have peed.] I kicked Min-guk lightly with my foot. But Min-guk's pants were dry. [Could it be… Did I pee?] I quickly touched my pants. My underwear was completely soaked. Mom brought a wet towel and wiped my body. \\"We can't do this. Sung-guk, let's go to the bathroom and shower.\\" \\"Mom…\\" I called out to mom in a surprised voice. \\"It's okay. Our Sung-guk must have been very tired.\\" Mom hugged me tightly and walked to the bathroom. I buried my face in mom's shoulder. This was the biggest embarrassment of my life. [I peed! Me! This Sung-guk!] \\"Dad, be quiet!\\" My ears turned red with embarrassment. \\"Sung-guk, dad actually peed in bed until first grade. The orphanage director scolded me so much. I thought I was going to die of fear.\\" \\"Honey, don't tease Sung-guk.\\" Mom quickly undressed me and washed my whole body with warm water. This kind of humiliation was a first in my life. After being potty-trained, I always controlled my bodily functions on time. There were difficult times, but peeing in bed to the point of soaking the blanket had never happened in my five-year life, not even in my previous life. \\"Soyoung, this won't do.\\" \\"What?\\" \\"How can we send this bed-wetting kid to the US alone? I remember how sad I was when the orphanage director scolded me when I was young. Even if I had parents, would they have scolded me like that? I thought about that a lot. Being parentless at a young age was really sad. If Sung-guk goes to the US and makes a mistake, we can't protect him.\\" [Dad, what are you talking about? I've been protecting mom and dad all this time.] \\"Ah, this bed-wetter. Let's wait until you grow up a bit more before going to the US. Until Sung-guk can solve everything on his own, mom and dad will always be by your side to protect you. Understand?\\" I felt a lump in my throat. [Why are you young parents trying to protect me? I'm the one protecting you!] \\"Huh-uh.\\" Contrary to my inner thoughts, tears blurred my vision. \\"Honey, go away. Sung-guk is embarrassed and crying.\\" I hugged mom tightly. Mom continuously patted my back. \\"Sung-guk, it's okay. Dad was just teasing because you usually don't do this. You won't pee again, right?\\" \\"Mom.\\" I called out to mom, sobbing. \\"Sung-guk, were you sad?\\" \\"Mom, will you protect me?\\" \\"Of course. Mom and dad exist in this world to protect Sung-guk. You know that, right?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I held back my tears and hugged mom."},{"prompt":"(In the town of Axel...)

[정말 비범하게 태어난 것도 골치 아픈 일이구나.] 나는 심드렁한 얼굴로 짜장면을 먹었다. 오늘 저녁은 특별히 나를 위한 짜장면이었다. 아빠가 짧게 지금의 상황에 대해서 설명을 했다. “양 비서님께서는 성국이는 미국 유학 보내는 게 어떻겠냐고 그러시더라고요. 이번에 회장님 자녀들이 모두 미국 가는데, 거기 함께요. 아무래도 성국이 같은 영재를 국내에서는 교육시키기 어려울 것 같다고 하시면서요.” 김미영은 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 흘금 김미영의 짜장면을 쳐다봤다. [김 매니저, 안 먹을 거면 내가 좀 더 먹어도 될까?] 요즘 키가 크느라 배 속이 계속 헛헛했다. 김미영은 내가 짜장면을 훔쳐보자, 빙긋 미소를 지으며 자신의 짜장을 덜어줬다. “성국아, 많이 먹어.” “네에, 감사합니다.” 나는 바르게 인사를 하고는 짜장면을 호로록 흡입했다. “부모님들 생각은 어떠세요?” 김미영이 엄마와 아빠를 조심스레 쳐다봤다. “저희야 아이랑 같이 있고 싶은 마음이 더 크긴 한데요. 언니, 그래도 성국이 미래를 위해서면 미국으로 가야 하지 않을까요? 이런 천재를 저희가 키우다가 평범해지면 어떻게 해요.” [엄마, 나 천재 아니야. 아이큐 겨우 121이라고. 에휴.] “성국이 아버지는 어떠세요?” “소영이는 아무래도 엄마니까 교육 문제에 좀 더 예민해요. 근데, 어제 글쎄, 성국이가 안 싸던 오줌을 쌌더라고요.” “아빠!” 나는 버럭 소리를 질렀다. 아빠가 웃으면서 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국이 창피하구나.” [하아, 이건 비밀이라고!] 김미영과 엄마의 웃음소리가 들렸다. 나는 고개를 저었다. [어른들이란….] 정말 종종 어른들은 어린아이가 얼마나 예민한지 잊을 때가 있었다. 나는 그냥 짜장면에 집중하기로 했다. 그리고 유학에 대한 나의 생각은 이미 정해져 있었다. “자기야, 성국이 창피해하잖아. 그만해.” “알았어, 알았어. 실수 같은 거 잘 안 하는 성국이가 실수하니까, 성국이도 아직 애기지. 그런 생각도 들고, 난 좋더라고.” [애기 아니거든.] 나는 짜장면을 후루룩 먹곤 입을 앙다물었다. “그럼, 성국이 아버지는 성국이 유학 반대 입장이신 거네요?” “지금은 좀 이르지 않나 싶어요. 겨우 다섯 살이잖아요. 입는 거, 씻는 거 다 돌봐줘야 하는 나이라고요. 아무리 삼전 그룹에서 보조해 주신다고 해도 부모만 못하잖아요.” [아빠, 내가 말을 안 했나 본데. 저번 생에서는 다섯 살 때부터 외국 수없이 왔다 갔다 했어. 엄마, 아빠는 당연히 없었고. 의전팀이 있긴 했네.] “성국이 아빠는 그런데, 나는 이 기회 놓치기가 아깝고 그래요, 언니.” “두 사람 마음 다 이해되네.” 나는 호로록 짜장면을 먹었다. 김미영이 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너는 어때?” [흠….] 나는 이성을 다잡고 저번 생의 전성국이었다면 어떤 결정을 했을까에 대해서 고민했다. 이미 저번 생에서 다 경험한 유학이라 선뜻 내키지 않는 게 속마음이었다. 그리고 나는 그들이 생각하는 만큼의 천재도 아니었다. 저번 생의 경험치가 누적되어 무척 뛰어난 아이일 뿐이었다. 미국의 영재교육 시스템 아래에서 아마 그들은 내가 노벨상 하나쯤 탈 인재로 성장하기를 바랄지도 모르지만, 나는 그 정도는 아니었다. 이건 냉철한 판단이었다. 그렇다면 안락한 엄마, 아빠 품에서 유년기를 보내는 게 맞지 않을까? 짜장면이나 실컷 먹으면서. 뭐, 이런 여러 가지 생각이 들었다. “어, 민국아! 민국아, 왜 그래?” 이야기를 나누는 동안 민국이가 사라졌다. 엄마가 얼른 안방으로 들어가는 게 보였다. [민국이 녀석, 또 무슨 사고를 친 거야?] 이때, 안방에서 민국이의 처절한 울음소리가 들렸다. “으아앙- 형아- 형아-.” [왜 나를 찾고 그러는 거야. 귀찮게.] “민국아, 왜 그래?” “형아. 형아.” 엄마가 달래도 민국이는 울 뿐이었다. [내가 나서야 하는 건가.] 나는 짜장면 먹던 포크를 놓고 안방으로 걸어갔다. 민국이가 울면서 내 옷이 든 옷장 서랍을 헤집고 있었다. 엄마가 민국이를 말렸다. “민국아, 왜 그래. 그거 형아 옷이야.” “으아아앙-.” [참 시끄럽게 우네.] 민국이는 옷장에서 연신 내 옷을 빼다가 이불 아래에 숨기고 있었다. [민국아, 네가 숨기는 거 다 보여.] 엄마는 민국이를 제지했지만, 민국이는 엄마마저 밀어버리고 옷을 계속 숨겼다. 나는 얼른 민국이한테 다가갔다. [너, 손님도 와 있는데 떼쓰면 형아가 혼낸다.] 민국이의 얼굴은 이미 눈물, 콧물 범벅이었다. “형아.” [형아 왜 찾아?] 민국이는 갑자기 눈물, 콧물 범벅이 된 손으로 나를 꽉 안았다. [이 녀석이 언제 이렇게 힘이 세졌지?] “놔아, 민국아.” 내가 몸을 틀수록 민국이는 나를 더 세게 안았다. “형아. 가디 마.” “어?” “형아. 가디 마.” [너 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 형, 미국 유학 가지 말라고?] “형아. 밍구기랑 여기 사라. 가디 마.” 나는 순간 몸이 굳었다. 이 녀석이 내 옷을 숨긴 것은 내가 떠날까 싶어서였다. 민국이는 나를 꽉 안고는 놓아주지 않았다. 하도 울어도 쉰 목소리로 계속해서 중얼거렸다. “형아. 가디 마. 밍구기랑 여기 사라. 가디 마.” 울컥. 눈시울이 뜨거워졌다. [왜 또 감동시키는 건데!] 저번 생에서 짧은 연수나 유학을 갈 때에도 동생들은 울지도 말리지도 않았다. 경쟁자가 눈앞에서 사라지는 것만으로도 안도하는 눈치들이었다. “크응-.” 민국이는 코를 쭉 들이켰다. [더럽게.] 나는 한 손으로 휴지를 집으려고 했지만, 민국이 때문에 손이 닿지 않았다. “밍구가, 이거 놔.” “시로, 형아. 어디도 못 가.” [정말 이 녀석.] 나는 어쩔 수 없이 대답했다. “밍구가, 형아 안 가. 아무 데도 안 가.” “진따?” 밍구기는 눈물을 뚝 그치고 초롱초롱한 눈으로 나를 올려다봤다. “형아, 진따야?” “응. 형아 안 가.” 나는 단호하게 말했다. * * * 삼성동의 전재형 회장의 집은 한남동의 집과는 사뭇 다른 분위기였다. 한남동이 철의 여왕의 취향에 맞춰서 프렌치 스타일의 인테리어를 추구했다면, 이곳은 전재형 회장의 취향이 그대로 묻어났다. 모던한 가구들과 전재형 회장이 선호하는 잭슨 폴의 작품들이 곳곳에 보였다. 잭슨 폴의 그림은 이제 세계 어느 곳에서도 구하기 힘들었다. 전재형 회장은 막 위스키를 따르던 참이었다. 양 비서가 들어오는 소리가 들렸다. 한남동 자택에서와 똑같은 것은 양 비서밖에 없었다. 양 비서 역시 전재형 회장을 따라서 인근으로 이사를 온 터였다. “회장님 취향이 그대로 묻어나는 인테리어네요.” “한남동 집은 너무 안락해서 영 내 취향이 아니었어.” “잭슨 폴 작품을 이번에 많이 구매하셨는데, 꽤 마음에 드시나 봐요?” “난 고전보다는 모던한 게 취향이거든.” 전재형 회장은 위스키를 한 잔 더 따라 양 비서에게 내밀었다. “이사하느라 양 비서도 수고했어.” “제 일인걸요.” 양 비서는 잔을 받으며 낮게 고개를 숙였다. 사실 오늘은 보고할 일이 있었다. “태국 군과 미진 양 유학은 잘 진행 중입니다. 사모님께서도 초기에는 같이 가셔서 적응할 때까지 같이 계실 것 같습니다.” “당연한 일이지. 태국이 사고 안 치게 주의 좀 기울이게.” “걱정 마십시오. 동기 중에 태국이 친구들도 몇 명 심어뒀고, 모두 저희에게 보고할 것입니다.” 전재형 회장은 고개를 끄덕였다. 자신의 유학 시절에도 그랬다. 돌아가신 아버지 전주신 전 회장 역시 전재형 회장이 유학하는 곳곳마다 친구라는 이름으로 몇 명을 심어두고 보고를 받았다. 지금 전재형 회장이 궁금한 건 따로 있었다. “그리고 성국 군은….” 전재형 회장의 오른쪽 눈썹이 올라갔다. 아이들의 이야기를 들을 때보다 더 신경 쓰이는 눈치였다. “성국 군은 이번에 같이 안 가기로 결정했습니다.” “의외인데….” 전재형 회장의 생각으로는 도저히 납득이 안 됐다. 이 좋은 기회를 날려 버리다니. “혹 성국이 부모들이 말린 건가. 평범한 사람들은 항상 그렇잖아. 가족이 더 중요하고, 아이를 끼고 자신들이 돌보아야 한다고 말이야.” “물론 성국이 부모님의 입장은 그런 부분이 있었습니다. 하지만 성국이 어머니 같은 경우에는 유학을 꽤 진지하게 고민하셨던 것 같습니다. 아무래도 더 좋은 환경에서 교육시키고 싶은 욕심이 있으셨거든요.” “그런데?” “성국이가 결정한 일이라고 합니다.” “겨우 다섯 살한테 결정을 맡겼다는 말인가?” “가족회의를 했다고 합니다.” “흠….” 전재형 회장은 위스키를 단숨에 들이켰다. 정말 납득 불가능한 일이었다. 인생의 단계를 점프할 수 있는 이런 소중한 기회를 날려 버리다니. “성국이가 뛰어난 아이이긴 하지만 아직 다섯 살이라 부모들의 손이 많이 갈 나이 아니겠습니까. 성국이 정도면 앞으로도 충분히 지켜보다 유학을 보내도 될 것 같습니다.” “그렇긴 하겠지. 다섯 살. 어리긴 하지.” 전재형 회장은 아쉬움을 삼켰다. 삼전 그룹을 이끌 차세대 인재라면 당연히 앞으로는 그 기회를 놓치지 않을 것이라고 믿었다. * * * 유학 이야기가 오간 이후로 민국이는 내 곁에서 떨어지지 않았다. 밥을 먹을 때도. 옷을 갈아입을 때도. 심지어 화장실을 갈 때도 껌딱지처럼 붙어 다녔다. “형아. 응아해?” “보면 몰라?” 내 인내심도 점점 바닥이 나고 있었다. 끄응. 나는 마지막 힘을 주고는 얼른 변기의 물을 내렸다. “형아, 밍구기도.” “너도 응아 마렵다고?” “응.” 나는 밍구기를 끌고 유아용 변기에 앉혔다. “힘줘.” “으응. 형아.” 민국이는 힘을 주면서도 내 손을 꼭 쥔 채였다. [경쟁자 녀석이 이젠 껌딱지가 되다니.] 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. 그래도 다행인 것은 이 녀석 덕분에 이성적으로 판단을 다시 할 수 있었다는 것이다. 내가 겨우 민국이가 날 붙잡고 오열해서 유학을 포기한 것으로 여긴다면 큰 오산이다. 민국이와 손을 잡고 잔 그날, 나는 내가 한 가지 사실을 간과했다는 것을 깨달았다. 그건 바로 삼전 그룹이었다. 만약 지금부터 삼전 그룹의 후원까지 받아 유학까지 간다면 나는 이번 생에서도 삼전 그룹의 그늘에서 벗어나기 어려웠다. 그건 내가 원한 삶이 아니었다. 내가 원한 진짜 삶은 이번 생에서 나 스스로 대한민국 최고가 되는 일이다. “형아, 응아 끄읕.” 민국이가 나를 향해 엉덩이를 내밀었다. [지금 뒤도 닦아달란 거냐?] “형아.” “하아….” 단전에서부터 깊은 한숨이 흘러나왔다. [나 정말 유학 포기한 거 잘한 거지?] 나는 한 손으로 코를 잡고, 휴지를 집어 들었다.","completion":"Episode 37 A family meeting was held. Kim Mi-young, who is now like a family member, was also present. Min-guk also took a seat. The reason everyone gathered was all because of me. Specifically, my study abroad issue. [Being born exceptionally is also a headache.] I ate my black bean noodles with a sullen face. Tonight's dinner was specially for me, black bean noodles. Dad briefly explained the current situation. \\"Secretary Yang suggested that it might be a good idea to send Seong-guk to study in the USA. This time, the chairman's children are all going to the USA, together. It seems difficult to educate a genius like Seong-guk domestically.\\" Kim Mi-young nodded her head. I sneakily glanced at Kim Mi-young's black bean noodles. [Manager Kim, if you're not going to eat, can I have some more?] Lately, I've been feeling hungry all the time because I'm growing. Seeing me eyeing her black bean noodles, Kim Mi-young smiled and scooped some onto my plate. \\"Seong-guk, eat a lot.\\" \\"Yes, thank you.\\" I politely thanked her and slurped the noodles. \\"What do the parents think?\\" Kim Mi-young cautiously looked at mom and dad. \\"We would rather be with our child, but for Seong-guk's future, shouldn't he go to the USA? What if we raise such a genius and he becomes ordinary.\\" [Mom, I'm not a genius. My IQ is just 121. Sigh.] \\"What does Seong-guk's father think?\\" \\"Since So-young is the mother, she's more sensitive about educational issues. But, yesterday, Seong-guk, who doesn't usually wet the bed, did.\\" \\"Dad!\\" I yelled out loud. Dad laughed and patted my head. \\"Seong-guk is embarrassed.\\" [Ah, that was supposed to be a secret!] I heard Kim Mi-young and mom's laughter. I shook my head. [Adults...] Adults often forget how sensitive a child can be. I decided to focus on my black bean noodles. And my thoughts on studying abroad were already decided. \\"Honey, Seong-guk is embarrassed. Stop it.\\" \\"Alright, alright. It's just that Seong-guk, who usually doesn't make mistakes, did, and it made me think he's still a baby. I liked that.\\" [I'm not a baby.] I slurped my noodles and clamped my mouth shut. \\"So, Seong-guk's father is against the study abroad?\\" \\"It seems a bit early now. He's only five years old. He needs care for dressing, washing, and everything. Even if the Samsung Group supports us, it's not the same as parents.\\" [Dad, I didn't say this, but in my previous life, I traveled abroad countless times from the age of five. Of course, without mom and dad. There was a protocol team.] \\"Seong-guk's dad, but I think it's a pity to miss this opportunity, sister.\\" \\"I understand both of your feelings.\\" I slurped my noodles. Kim Mi-young looked at me. \\"Seong-guk, what do you think?\\" [Hmm...] I pondered what the previous Seong-guk would have decided. Having already experienced studying abroad in my previous life, I wasn't keen on it. And I wasn't the genius they thought I was. I was just a child with accumulated experience from my previous life. Under the American genius education system, they might hope I could win a Nobel Prize, but I wasn't that level. This was a sober judgment. Then, wouldn't it be right to spend my childhood in the comfortable arms of my parents? Eating black bean noodles to my heart's content. Well, these were the thoughts I had. \\"Hey, Min-guk! Min-guk, what's wrong?\\" While we were talking, Min-guk had disappeared. I saw mom quickly entering the bedroom. [What trouble has Min-guk gotten into now?] Then, from the bedroom, Min-guk's desperate crying was heard. \\"Uwaaah- Brother- Brother-.\\" [Why is he looking for me? So annoying.] \\"Min-guk, what's wrong?\\" \\"Brother. Brother.\\" Even as mom tried to soothe him, Min-guk just cried. [Do I need to step in?] I put down my fork and walked to the bedroom. Min-guk was crying and rummaging through my clothes in the closet. Mom tried to stop Min-guk. \\"Min-guk, what are you doing? That's brother's clothes.\\" \\"Uwaaah-.\\" [He's so loud.] Min-guk kept taking out my clothes and hiding them under the blanket. [Min-guk, I can see everything you're hiding.] Mom tried to stop him, but Min-guk pushed her away and continued to hide the clothes. I quickly approached Min-guk. [If you throw a tantrum while we have guests, I'll scold you.] Min-guk's face was already a mess of tears and snot. \\"Brother.\\" [Why are you looking for me?] Suddenly, Min-guk, with his tear and snot-covered hands, hugged me tightly. [When did this kid get so strong?] \\"Let go, Min-guk.\\" The more I struggled, the tighter Min-guk hugged me. \\"Brother. Don't go.\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Brother. Don't go.\\" [Did you just say, brother, don't go study abroad?] \\"Brother. Stay here with Min-guk. Don't go.\\" I froze for a moment. Min-guk was hiding my clothes because he was afraid I would leave. Min-guk hugged me tightly and wouldn't let go, his voice hoarse from crying. \\"Brother. Don't go. Stay here with Min-guk. Don't go.\\" I felt a lump in my throat. [Why are you making me emotional!] In my previous life, when I went on short exchanges or study abroad, my siblings neither cried nor tried to stop me. They seemed relieved to see a competitor disappear. \\"Kuhng-.\\" Min-guk sniffled. [So gross.] I tried to reach for a tissue with one hand, but I couldn't because of Min-guk. \\"Min-guk, let go.\\" \\"Don't, brother. You can't go anywhere.\\" [Really, this kid.] I had no choice but to answer. \\"Min-guk, brother won't go. Not anywhere.\\" \\"Really?\\" Min-guk stopped crying and looked up at me with bright eyes. \\"Brother, really?\\" \\"Yep. Brother won't go.\\" I said firmly. * * * The atmosphere at Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's house in Samseong-dong was quite different from the house in Hannam-dong. If Hannam-dong pursued a French-style interior to suit the taste of the Iron Queen, this place reflected Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's preferences. Modern furniture and works by Jackson Pollock, whom Chairman Jeon preferred, were visible everywhere. Jackson Pollock's paintings were now hard to find anywhere in the world. Chairman Jeon was just pouring whiskey. Secretary Yang entered. The only thing the same as the Hannam-dong residence was Secretary Yang. Secretary Yang had also moved nearby following Chairman Jeon. \\"The interior really reflects the chairman's taste.\\" \\"The Hannam-dong house was too cozy, not really my style.\\" \\"You've purchased a lot of Jackson Pollock's works recently, you must really like them?\\" \\"I prefer modern to classic.\\" Chairman Jeon poured another glass of whiskey and offered it to Secretary Yang. \\"You've worked hard with the move, Secretary Yang.\\" \\"It's my job.\\" Secretary Yang took the glass and bowed slightly. In fact, there was something to report today. \\"The military in Thailand and Mi-jin Yang's study abroad are progressing well. The madam will also go initially to help them adapt.\\" \\"Of course. Make sure Thailand doesn't cause any trouble.\\" \\"Don't worry. We've planted a few of Thailand's friends among the students, and they will all report to us.\\" Chairman Jeon nodded. It was the same during his study abroad. His late father, former Chairman Jeon Ju-shin, also planted a few friends under the name of friendship in every place Chairman Jeon studied to receive reports. What Chairman Jeon was curious about now was something else. \\"And Seong-guk...\\" Chairman Jeon's right eyebrow raised. He seemed more concerned than when hearing about the other children. \\"Seong-guk has decided not to go this time.\\" \\"Unexpected...\\" Chairman Jeon couldn't believe it. To throw away such a good opportunity. \\"Did Seong-guk's parents dissuade him? Ordinary people are always like that. Family is more important, and they believe they must take care of their child themselves.\\" \\"Of course, Seong-guk's parents had that aspect. But Seong-guk's mother seemed to seriously consider the study abroad. She probably wanted to educate him in a better environment.\\" \\"But?\\" \\"Seong-guk made the decision.\\" \\"You left the decision to a five-year-old?\\" \\"They had a family meeting.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" Chairman Jeon downed his whiskey in one gulp. It was truly an incomprehensible situation. To waste such a precious opportunity to jump ahead in life. \\"Seong-guk is still five years old, so his parents will need to take care of him a lot. It seems we can wait and see before sending Seong-guk to study abroad.\\" \\"That's true. Five years old. Still young.\\" Chairman Jeon swallowed his disappointment. If Seong-guk was to lead the next generation of the Samsung Group, he believed that he would not miss the opportunity in the future. * * * After the talk about studying abroad, Min-guk wouldn't leave my side. Even when eating. Even when changing clothes. Even when going to the bathroom, he stuck to me like glue. \\"Brother. Poop?\\" \\"Can't you see?\\" My patience was running thin. Ugh. I exerted my last bit of strength and quickly flushed the toilet. \\"Brother, Min-guk too.\\" \\"You need to poop too?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I dragged Min-guk to the child's toilet and sat him down. \\"Push.\\" \\"Ugh. Brother.\\" Even as Min-guk exerted himself, he held my hand tightly. [The competitor kid has now become a sticky gum.] I shook my head. But the good thing was, thanks to this kid, I was able to make a rational decision again. If I think I gave up studying abroad just because Min-guk held me and cried, that would be a big mistake. The night I held hands with Min-guk, I realized I had overlooked one fact. It was the Samsung Group. If I accepted the support of the Samsung Group from now and went to study abroad, I would have difficulty escaping the shadow of the Samsung Group in this life. That wasn't the life I wanted. The real life I wanted in this life was to become the best in South Korea on my own. \\"Brother, poop done.\\" Min-guk turned his butt towards me. [Are you asking me to wipe your butt now?] \\"Brother.\\" \\"Sigh...\\" A deep sigh flowed from my core. [Did I really make the right decision not to study abroad?] I held my nose with one hand and picked up the tissue."},{"prompt":"If a function f has a Taylor series at a point x_0 which converges to f in some radius around x_0, and x_1 is in this radius, does the Taylor series at x_1 exist and equal f?","completion":"When a function (f) has a Taylor series that converges to (f) on some interval around (x_0), it implies that (f) is infinitely differentiable at (x_0), and that the infinite series of its derivatives at (x_0) converges to the function values within this interval of convergence. Now, suppose there's a point (x_1) within this radius of convergence around (x_0). The crucial question is whether or not a Taylor series can be developed for (f) at (x_1) and if that series also converges to (f). A few observations and principles apply: 1. **Existence of Derivatives**: For the Taylor series to exist for (f) at (x_1), (f) must be infinitely differentiable at (x_1) as well. The fact that (f) has a convergent Taylor series at (x_0) suggests smoothness around (x_0), but without additional information about the behavior of (f) beyond its convergence at (x_0), we cannot immediately assert that (f) is also infinitely differentiable at (x_1). 2. **Local Nature of Taylor Series**: The Taylor series is fundamentally a local approximation, derived from and about a specific point. Just because (f) is well-behaved and has a convergent Taylor series at (x_0), doesn't guarantee the same at a different point, even if that point is within the original series' radius of convergence. Theoretically, (f) could have properties or behaviors at or around (x_1) (like discontinuities in higher derivatives) that do not impact convergence at (x_0) but affect its own Taylor series. 3. **Analytic Functions**: If (f) is known to be analytic on an interval containing (x_0) and (x_1), then by definition, (f) can be represented by a convergent Taylor series around any point in that interval. Analyticity implies that the function can be locally approximated by a power series not just at (x_0), but also at (x_1), and indeed, this series will converge to (f). 4. **Radius of Convergence**: If you are establishing a new Taylor series at (x_1), its radius of convergence might differ from the original series around (x_0). The new series will converge to (f) within its own radius of convergence, which needs independent determination and could be influenced by the overall properties of (f) and its derivatives as seen from (x_1). In summary, while the existence of a convergent Taylor series for (f) at (x_0) is encouraging regarding (f)'s smoothness and behavior, whether a Taylor series exists at (x_1) (within this radius) and converges to (f) depends on (f)'s properties at and around (x_1). If (f) is known to be analytic in the interval containing both (x_0) and (x_1), then yes, the Taylor series at (x_1) will exist and converge to (f). Otherwise, additional investigation into the smoothness and behavior of (f) at (x_1) is required."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[아빠, 노크도 없이 이러면 안 되지. 나도 프라이버시가 있다고.] 나는 얼른 달려가서 배꼽 인사를 했다. “안녕히 주무세요.” “성국아, 9시가 넘었어. 이제 자야지. 아빠가 재워줄까?” [그건 정말 사양할게. 차라리 베개 안고 잘 거야.] 나는 얼른 베개를 안고 침대로 뛰어 올라갔다. 아빠는 그런 나를 보며 흐뭇한 미소를 지으며 방 불을 껐다. “성국아, 잘 자.” 나는 눈을 감고 자는 척을 했지만, 머릿속으로는 민국이의 데뷔를 위한 플랜을 짜고 있었다. * * * 유치원 가방을 내던지자마자 나는 민국이에게로 달려갔다. 민국이를 봐주시는 이모님은 내 간식을 챙기러 부엌에 간 타이밍이었다. 나는 민국이를 끌어다가 TV 앞에 앉혔다. 그리고 TV를 켰다. TV 유치원을 하기 전 광고 시간이었다. 시청자들을 고려해서인지 아역들이 나오는 광고들이 연이어 나왔다. “밍구가, 저거 봐.” “헤헤.” 민국이는 그저 입을 벌린 채 광고를 봤다. “밍구가, 입을 좀 더 벌리고 웃어봐.” “헤에헤에.” 민국이는 생각보다 내 지시를 잘 따랐다. “성국아, 민국이 데리고 뭐 하는 거야?” 이모님이 오는 바람에 내 연기 수업은 시작도 제대로 하기 전에 끝이 났다. “성국아, 우유랑 바나나 먹자.” [오늘은 어쩔 수 없군.] 나는 이모님이 내민 우유와 바나나를 먹으며 민국이에게 아역이 나오는 광고만 집중적으로 보여줬다. [우선은 많이 보는 게 공부가 되는 거야.] 민국이는 넋 나간 얼굴로 TV를 쳐다봤다. “엄마 왔어.” 문이 열리면서 엄마와 김미영이 함께 퇴근했다. 김미영은 이제 우리와 같은 아파트 다른 동에 살았다. 수유의 건물을 정리하고, 잠실의 24평 아파트를 사고 나머지 금액으로는 근처의 작은 상가를 두 채 정도 샀다고 들었다. [역시 김미영의 부동산 감각은 탁월해.] 솔직히 재벌로 살다 보니 부동산을 매매하는 일은 나와 크게 관계가 없었다. 태어났을 때부터 서울 가장 비싼 땅에 집이 몇 채나 됐고, 원한다면 어디든 집을 살 수도 있었다. 서울뿐 아니라 뉴욕과 파리 어느 나라에도 말이다. 종종 공장 부지나 본사 이전 등으로 땅을 매입하는 경우가 있었지만, 그런 것은 어차피 회사에 따로 담당하는 전문가들이 있었다. 아무리 싼 땅도 삼전 그룹의 계열사가 들어서는 순간, 도시가 생기고 땅값이 치솟기도 했다. 부동산 시장을 따라가는 게 아니라, 한마디로 부동산 시장 자체를 만드는 역할을 한 것이다. [김미영과 조만간 심도 깊은 대화 좀 나눠야겠어.] 나는 종종걸음으로 김미영에게 다가가 인사를 했다. “안냥하세요.” “성국아, 안 본 사이에 키가 더 큰 것 같은데. 성국이 엄마, 맞죠?” “네, 언니. 성국이 내복 좀 보세요. 석 달 전에 산 건데 벌써 발목 보여요.” “진짜네. 성국이 키도 엄청 크겠다.” [당연하지.] 아빠가 어림잡아 180센티미터. 엄마도 165센티미터가 넘는 키였다. 이런 유전자라면 내 키도 못 해도 아빠는 넘어설 것 같았다. 내가 저번 생에서 178센티미터였으니, 이번 생에서는 180센티미터를 드디어 넘어볼 수도 있을 것 같았다. [아차, 깜빡했네.] 나는 김미영의 손을 잡고 TV 앞으로 끌고 갔다. TV 앞에는 민국이가 있었다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “밍구기.” 나는 손가락으로 민국이를 가리켰다. “민국이가 왜?” “밍구기가 저거 하루 종일 봐요.” 때마침 아역이 나오는 광고였다. 물론 이 시간에 저 광고가 나온다는 것은 이미 알고 있었다. 김미영은 예리한 눈으로 민국이를 살폈다. 민국이는 내 교육 덕분에 광고 모델을 보면서 표정을 흉내 냈다. 이런 민국이를 어엿한 기획사 대표 김미영이 놓칠 리가 없었다. “민국아, 지금 혹시 저 표정 따라 한 거야?” “녜에!” “민국아, 너도 저렇게 하고 싶어?” 민국이가 슬쩍 내 눈치를 살폈다. 나는 두 눈을 끔뻑했다. 어서 그렇다고 대답하란 신호였다. “녜에!” “언니, 민국이가 뭐라는 거예요?” “성국이 엄마, 민국이가 TV 광고 보면서 흉내 내는데, 제법인데요.” “성국이 하는 거 보고 따라 하는 건가….” “성국이 엄마, 안 그래도 다음 주에 곽 감독님이랑 점심 먹기로 했거든요. 선미 씨 광고 때문에요. 제가 한번 민국이가 응시해볼 만한 광고 알아볼까요?” “민국이를요….” 엄마는 걱정이 앞서는 모양이었다. 나는 얼른 엄마에게 달려가서 다리에 매달렸다. [엄마, 민국이도 이제 지 밥값을 벌어야지. 언제까지 집에서 저렇게 놀릴 거야? 우리처럼 가난한 처지에.] “성국아, 잠깐만.” 엄마는 나를 안아 들고는 민국이에게로 갔다. “민국아, 엄마 좀 봐.” “엄. 마!” 민국이는 헤벌쭉 웃으며 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “민국아, 너도 TV 나오고 싶어. 형아처럼?” 나는 얼른 그러라는 눈빛을 민국이에게 보냈다. 민국이는 해맑은 얼굴로 크게 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 몰래 엄지손가락을 치켜세웠다. [전민국, 잘했어.] * * * 유치원이 끝나자마자 나는 엄마 손을 잡고 민국이와 함께 오디션장으로 향했다. 곽 감독이 새로 찍는 세제 광고에 나올 아역이 필요하단 연락이 왔기 때문이다. 오디션장은 곽 감독의 광고 회사였다. 학동역 부근에 위치한 곽 감독의 광고 회사는 단독 주택을 개조한 곳으로 마당에는 거북이가 돌아다니고 있었다. 내가 민국이의 손을 잡고 들어서자 나를 알아본 조연출 한 명이 반갑게 인사를 했다. “성국아, 나 기억나? 진희 누나야.” [기억나지, 당연히. 진희 누나, 맨날 뒤에서 곽 감독 성격 이상하다고 투덜거렸잖아. 근데 아직도 잘 다니네.] “와, 네가 성국이 동생이구나. 동생도 정말 잘생겼네요.” [그 말은 오늘만 용서해줄게. 오늘은 민국이 오디션이니까.] 조연출은 우리를 대기장으로 안내했다. “세 살에서 다섯 살까지 오디션 보거든요. 어머니, 성국이도 보는 거 어때요? 성국이가 광고계를 떠나서 사람들이 얼마나 아쉬워하는지 몰라요.” “성국이는 요즘 공부하느라 정신이 없어요.” “아쉽네요.” 광고 회사 안쪽에 마련된 대기 장소에는 이미 열댓 명의 아이들이 있었다. 조연출의 말대로 세 살부터 다섯 살 정도로 보이는 아이들이었다. 내가 대기실에 들어서자 순간 모두 긴장한 기색이 역력했다. 아무리 내가 이 업계를 떠난 지 좀 됐지만, 모두들 나를 기억하고 있었다. 이때, 한 아이의 엄마가 나를 보더니 투덜거렸다. “성국이도 오디션 보는 거예요?” “아니에요. 성국이는 오늘 동생 때문에 같이 온 거예요.” 조연출이 얼른 설명을 했지만, 대기실의 분위기는 여전히 차가웠다. “누구 동생이라고 특혜 더 주고 그런 거 아니죠?” 떽떽거리는 여자의 목소리가 익숙했다. [어디서 들어본 목소리인데.] 나는 여자와 여자의 곁에 앉은 남자아이를 쳐다봤다. 내 또래로 보이는 남자아이는 동그란 눈에 별 특색 없는 얼굴이었다. 그리고 그 아이의 엄마로 보이는 여자는. [맞다! 덕풍 제지!] 남자아이의 이름은 이재희. 내 인생 첫 오디션에서 처음으로 좌절을 보게 해준 녀석이었다. 덕풍 제지 손자라는 이유로 광고 모델로 발탁됐지만, 곱게 자라서 세상 물정 모르던 녀석은 수없이 NG를 낸 바람에 촬영 중에 잘리고 말았다. 재능도 없으면서 아직도 광고계를 어슬렁거리고 있는 모양이었다. 방금 전 특혜니 뭐니 따진 여자는 아들에게 추억을 만들어준단 이유로 덕풍 제지 백으로 모두를 들러리 세우고 광고 모델로 만든 덕풍 제지의 며느리였다. 그런데 어딘가 여자의 행색이 조금 초라해 보였다. 그때도 들고 있던 샤랭의 가방은 모서리가 해졌고, 분명 그때도 입고 있었던 것 같은 트위드 재질의 재킷과 스커트도 낡아 보였다. 명품이지만 유행 지난 느낌이 확실히 있었다. 나는 엄마를 올려다봤다. 4년 전 엄마는 돌이 막 지난 나를 안고 버스를 타고 이태원에 있는 삼전 기획에 오디션을 보러 갔었다. 그때 엄마는 유일한 외출복인 검은색 원피스를 조금 창피해했다. 하지만 지금의 엄마는 비록 명품은 아니지만 깔끔한 재킷에 청바지를 매치해서 입었다. 작년에 아빠가 생일 선물이라며 사준 국내 브랜드의 핸드백도 들고 있었다. 그리고 그때나 지금이나 엄마는 여전히 아름다웠다. 나는 저벅저벅 이재희에게 걸어갔다. “안냥.” 내가 먼저 환하게 웃자 이재희는 영문도 모른 채 배시시 웃으며 인사를 받아줬다. “안냥.” 이재희의 엄마는 못마땅한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 나 기억하니?” [물론 기억하지. 중소기업 며느리.] 하지만 보통의 아이들은 결코 기억할 수 없는 시간이었다. 나는 모른 척 정중하게 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “우리 아들 대타로 네가 광고 찍어서 대박 난 거야. 그러니까 네가 광고 찍은 거 다 우리 덕분이야.” [할 말은 많지만, 하지 않겠어. 중소기업 며느리.] 나는 입을 앙다물었다. “성구가. 나 사인 좀.” 이재희는 예전에는 좀 예민해 보였지만, 엄마만큼 성격이 나쁘지는 않은 모양이었다. 나는 이재희가 내민 종이에 전성국 이름을 선명히 적어줬다. “고마워, 성구가.” “재희야.” “응?” “카메라 앞에선 무조건 웃어.” 이건 내가 이재희에게 주는 연기 팁이었다. 어쨌든 이 녀석이 그때 내 말을 듣고 임선미의 성형한 코를 가격해준 덕분에 내가 이 자리에 있는 것이기도 했다. 이재희는 알 듯 모를 듯 한 얼굴로 고개를 살짝 까딱였다. “재희야, 머리 좀 다시 만지자.” 덕풍 제지 며느리는 신경질적으로 재희와 나를 떨어뜨려 났다. 나는 다시 민국이 옆으로 돌아왔다. 벌써 넉살 좋은 몇 명의 아이 엄마들이 다가와서 나에게 사인을 청했다. 이때, 안에서 이재희를 호출하는 목소리가 들렸다. “재희야, 어서 가자.” 이재희는 엄마의 재촉에 못 이겨 오디션장 안으로 들어가면서 나를 흘끔 쳐다봤다. 나는 눈을 찡끗해줬다. “근데 저 여자는 맨날 만나네.” 나에게 사인을 받던 여자가 중얼거렸다. “저분 아세요?” 엄마가 조심스레 물었다. 사실 엄마도 덕풍 제지 며느리를 한눈에 알아봤지만 모른 척하고 있었다. “예전 덕풍 제지 며느리잖아요. 근데 덕풍 제지 회장이 젊은 여자한테 빠져서 재산을 모조리 그 여자한테 넘기는 바람에 저 집 아들들은 건져서 나온 게 없대요. 다들 순식간에 망해서 폐인 되고, 아들 하나 어떻게든 연예인 만들어서 성공시키려고 돌아다니는데. 제가 보기에 아들이 영 재능이 없어요.” “그렇군요.” 엄마의 표정이 조금 시무룩해졌다. 그러더니 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 너 첫 광고 오디션 때 네가 인사한 애랑 같이 경쟁했었어. 돌 막 지난 때라 기억 안 날 거야.” [엄마, 뭔 소리야. 나 다 기억해.] 김미영도 혀를 낮게 찼다. “아, 저 집이 덕풍 제지였군요.” “언니도 알아요?” “저 집 소문 파다했어요. 며느리가 그때 삼전 기획에 돈 주고 광고 하나 밀어 넣었다가 성국이한테 밀렸잖아요. 회사에서도 말 많았어요.” 달칵. 오디션장 문이 열리면서 이재희가 엄마와 나왔다. 꽤 밝은 얼굴이었다. 조연출이 웃으며 손을 흔들었다. “민국이 차례예요.” “언니, 제가 같이 갈게요. 성국이 좀 봐주세요.” 나는 민국이 손을 꼭 잡고 눈을 마주쳤다. [전민국. 너도 이제 세 살이야. 형 말 알지?] 민국이는 다부지게 고개를 끄덕이며 힘차게 대답했다. “바압갑!”","completion":"Episode 38 After doing his business, Minguk with his refreshed face kept grinning at me. I stared hard at Minguk. \\"Brother.\\" \\"Mingoo. From now on, listen well to your brother.\\" \\"Yes!\\" He answered well. \\"Now that you're three years old, you should know about our family's situation. Understand?\\" Tilting his head. Minguk tilted his head. I grabbed Minguk's head and fixed it in place. \\"Pay attention, bro.\\" \\"Yes!\\" Again, he answered well. \\"Mingoo. Our mom and dad are orphans of this world. That means, to survive in South Korea, both you and I need to keep our wits about us and live properly.\\" \\"Yes!\\" [I wonder if he even understands what I'm saying.] Anyway, I finished what I was saying. \\"Since I started earning my keep right after turning one, being three means it's time for you to earn more than your keep. Got it?\\" \\"Yes, brother. Happy. Happy. Mingoo. Will.\\" \\"Right, from now on, you'll be earning your keep too.\\" \\"Yes!\\" Minguk clenched his fists tightly. That night, I began devising a meticulous plan for Minguk's debut, who knew nothing about the world. Since Minguk's face was a bit lacking, he had to win with expressions typical of a child. That meant I had to start giving Minguk acting lessons from tomorrow. Being the teacher, when I had once dominated the child actor scene in South Korea, Minguk was truly lucky. \\"Sungkook, what are you doing up? Not sleeping?\\" Dad, who had just showered, peeked into the room. [Dad, you can't just come in without knocking. I have my privacy too.] I quickly ran and gave him a belly button greeting. \\"Good night.\\" \\"Sungkook, it's past 9. Time to sleep. Should Dad put you to bed?\\" [I'll have to decline that. I'd rather hug a pillow and sleep.] I quickly grabbed a pillow and jumped onto the bed. Dad looked at me with a pleased smile and turned off the room light. \\"Sungkook, sleep well.\\" I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep, but in my head, I was planning for Minguk's debut. * * * As soon as I threw my kindergarten bag, I ran to Minguk. The timing was perfect as the auntie looking after Minguk had gone to the kitchen to prepare my snack. I pulled Minguk to sit in front of the TV and turned it on. It was commercial time before the TV kindergarten program. Considering the audience, commercials featuring child actors followed one after another. \\"Mingoo, look at that.\\" \\"Hehe.\\" Minguk just watched the commercials with his mouth open. \\"Mingoo, open your mouth wider and laugh.\\" \\"Heeheehee.\\" Minguk followed my instructions better than expected. \\"Sungkook, what are you doing with Minguk?\\" Our acting lesson was abruptly ended before it could properly start because the auntie came back. \\"Sungkook, let's have milk and bananas.\\" [Can't be helped today.] While eating the milk and bananas given by the auntie, I made sure Minguk focused on commercials featuring child actors. [Watching a lot is part of learning.] Minguk watched the TV with a vacant expression. \\"Mom's home.\\" The door opened, and mom came back from work with Kim Miyoung. Kim Miyoung now lived in a different building in the same apartment complex as us. After settling the building in Suyu, she bought a 24-pyeong apartment in Jamsil and invested the remaining money in a couple of small commercial properties nearby. [Kim Miyoung's real estate sense is truly exceptional.] Honestly, dealing with real estate transactions wasn't much related to me since I lived like a chaebol. From birth, I had several houses on Seoul's most expensive lands, and if I wanted, I could buy a house anywhere, not just in Seoul but also in New York and Paris. Occasionally, there were land purchases for factory sites or headquarters relocation, but those were handled by the company's dedicated experts. Even the cheapest land would become a city and its value would skyrocket the moment a Samsung Group affiliate moved in. In other words, we didn't follow the real estate market; we essentially created it. [I should have a deep conversation with Kim Miyoung soon.] I approached Kim Miyoung with a trot and greeted her. \\"Hello.\\" \\"Sungkook, you seem to have grown taller. You're Sungkook's mom, right?\\" \\"Yes, sister. Look at Sungkook's underwear. Bought it three months ago, and it's already showing his ankles.\\" \\"Really. Sungkook's going to be tall.\\" [Of course.] Dad was roughly 180 centimeters tall, and mom was over 165 centimeters. With such genetics, it seemed likely I would surpass dad's height. In my previous life, I was 178 centimeters tall, so in this life, I might finally surpass 180 centimeters. [Oh, I forgot.] I grabbed Kim Miyoung's hand and led her to the TV. Minguk was there. \\"Sungkook, what's up?\\" \\"Mingoo.\\" I pointed at Minguk. \\"What about Minguk?\\" \\"Mingoo watches that all day.\\" Just then, a commercial featuring a child actor was on. Of course, I already knew that commercial would be on at this time. Kim Miyoung scrutinized Minguk with sharp eyes. Thanks to my training, Minguk mimicked the expressions of the commercial models. Kim Miyoung, a capable agency CEO, wouldn't miss this. \\"Minguk, did you just imitate that expression?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Minguk, do you want to do that too?\\" Minguk glanced at me cautiously. I blinked twice. It was a signal for him to say yes. \\"Yes!\\" \\"Sister, what did Minguk say?\\" \\"Sungkook's mom, Minguk is imitating the TV commercials well, it's quite something.\\" \\"Is he following what Sungkook does...\\" \\"Sungkook's mom, I'm having lunch with Director Kwak next week because of Sunmi's commercial. Should I look into commercials that Minguk could audition for?\\" \\"Minguk...\\" Mom seemed worried. I quickly ran to mom and clung to her legs. [Mom, Minguk should start earning his keep too. How long will he play around at home? Given our poor circumstances.] \\"Sungkook, wait a moment.\\" Mom picked me up and went to Minguk. \\"Minguk, look at mom.\\" \\"Mom. Ma!\\" Minguk looked at mom with a wide grin. \\"Minguk, do you want to be on TV too? Like your brother?\\" I quickly gave Minguk a look to say yes. Minguk nodded his head vigorously with a bright face. I secretly gave him a thumbs up. [Well done, Jeon Minguk.] * * * As soon as kindergarten was over, I held mom's hand and headed to the audition venue with Minguk. We received a call that Director Kwak's new detergent commercial needed a child actor. The audition venue was Director Kwak's advertising company. Located near Hakdong Station, Director Kwak's advertising company was a renovated detached house with turtles roaming the yard. As I entered holding Minguk's hand, a familiar assistant director greeted us warmly. \\"Sungkook, remember me? It's Jinhee noona.\\" [Of course, I remember. Jinhee noona, you always complained about Director Kwak's weird personality behind his back. But you're still working here.] \\"Wow, you're Sungkook's younger brother. He's really handsome.\\" [That comment, I'll let it slide today. Today's about Minguk's audition.] The assistant director led us to the waiting area. \\"Children from three to five years old are auditioning. Mother, how about Sungkook tries too? You have no idea how much people miss him in the advertising world.\\" \\"Sungkook is too busy studying these days.\\" \\"That's a shame.\\" Inside the waiting area prepared by the advertising company, there were already about a dozen children. As the assistant director said, they looked to be between three to five years old. As I entered the waiting room, everyone seemed tense for a moment. Even though I had been away from this industry for a while, everyone remembered me. Then, a child's mother looked at me and grumbled. \\"Is Sungkook auditioning too?\\" \\"No. Sungkook came today because of his brother.\\" The assistant director quickly explained, but the atmosphere in the waiting room remained cold. \\"I hope there's no special treatment just because he's someone's brother.\\" The grumbling woman's voice sounded familiar. [Where have I heard it before?] I looked at the woman and the boy sitting next to her. The boy, who seemed to be my age, had round eyes and an unremarkable face. The woman, presumably his mother, was... [Right! Deokpoong Paper!] The boy's name was Lee Jaehui. He was the one who first made me experience frustration at my very first audition. Because he was the grandson of Deokpoong Paper, he was selected as the commercial model, but he was cut during filming due to countless NGs since he grew up sheltered and unaware of the world. Despite having no talent, he was still lurking around the advertising world. The woman who just complained about special treatment had tried to create memories for her son by using Deokpoong Paper's influence to push everyone aside and make him a commercial model. But something about the woman's appearance seemed a bit shabby. The Chanel bag she was still carrying had worn corners, and the tweed jacket and skirt she seemed to have worn back then looked old. Though they were luxury items, they definitely felt out of fashion. I looked up at mom. Four years ago, mom, holding me just past my first birthday, took a bus to Samjeon Planning in Itaewon for an audition. Back then, mom was a bit embarrassed by her only black dress for going out. But now, mom was dressed neatly in a jacket and jeans, not luxury brands but clean. She was also carrying a handbag from a domestic brand that dad bought her as a birthday gift last year. And mom was still beautiful, then and now. I walked up to Jaehui. \\"Hello.\\" When I greeted him with a bright smile, Jaehui, not understanding the situation, smiled back and greeted me. \\"Hello.\\" Jaehui's mom looked at me with displeasure. \\"Sungkook, do you remember me?\\" [Of course, I remember. The daughter-in-law of a medium-sized company.] But it was a time that ordinary children could never remember. I politely greeted her as if I didn't know her. \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"You got to shoot the commercial as a substitute for my son, and it was a hit. So, it's all thanks to us that you got to shoot that commercial.\\" [I have a lot to say, but I won't. Daughter-in-law of a medium-sized company.] I kept my mouth shut. \\"Sungkoo, can I have your autograph?\\" Jaehui seemed a bit sensitive before, but he wasn't as bad as his mother. I signed my name, Jeon Sungkook, clearly on the paper Jaehui handed me. \\"Thanks, Sungkoo.\\" \\"Jaehui.\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Always smile in front of the camera.\\" This was my acting tip for Jaehui. After all, it was thanks to him listening to me and hitting Lim Sunmi's surgically enhanced nose that I'm here today. Jaehui nodded slightly, looking somewhat understanding. \\"Jaehui, let's fix your hair.\\" Deokpoong Paper's daughter-in-law nervously separated Jaehui and me. I returned to Minguk's side. Several mothers of cheeky children approached me for autographs. Then, Jaehui was called into the audition room. \\"Jaehui, let's go.\\" Jaehui reluctantly entered the audition room, glancing at me. I squinted my eyes at him. \\"But that woman is always around.\\" A woman receiving my autograph muttered. \\"Do you know her?\\" Mom cautiously asked. She recognized Deokpoong Paper's daughter-in-law at a glance but pretended not to know. \\"Yeah, she's the former daughter-in-law of Deokpoong Paper. But the chairman of Deokpoong Paper fell for a younger woman and transferred all his wealth to her, leaving nothing for his sons. They all quickly went bankrupt and became destitute. She's trying to make her son a successful entertainer by dragging him around, but from what I see, the son has no talent.\\" \\"I see.\\" Mom's expression turned a bit gloomy, then she held my hand. \\"Sungkook, at your first commercial audition, you competed with the child you greeted. You were just over a year old, so you might not remember.\\" [Mom, what are you talking about? I remember everything.] Kim Miyoung also clicked her tongue. \\"Ah, so that was Deokpoong Paper's family.\\" \\"Sister, you knew?\\" \\"Yeah, that family was quite the talk. The daughter-in-law paid to push a commercial through Samjeon Planning but was outdone by Sungkook. There was a lot of talk at the company.\\" Click. The audition room door opened, and Jaehui came out with his mom. He seemed quite happy. The assistant director waved with a smile. \\"It's Minguk's turn.\\" \\"Sister, I'll go with him. Please take care of Sungkook.\\" I looked Minguk in the eye and held his hand tightly. [Jeon Minguk. You're three years old now. You know what your brother said, right?] Minguk nodded vigorously and answered energetically. \\"Will do my best!\\""},{"prompt":"제38화 응아까지 하고 시원한 얼굴의 민국이는 나를 보며 연신 히죽거렸다. 나는 민국이 녀석을 뚫어져라 쳐다봤다. “형아.” “밍구가. 이제부터 형아 말 잘 들어.” “응!” 대답은 잘했다. “너도 이제 세 살이나 됐으니 우리 집 사정을 알아야 할 것이야. 알아들어?” 갸웃. 민국이는 고개를 갸웃거렸다. 나는 민국이의 고개를 딱 잡아 고정시켰다. “형, 주목해.” “응!” 이번에도 대답은 잘했다. “밍구가. 우리 엄마, 아빠는 천애 고아야. 그 말은 대한민국에서 살아남기 위해서는 너나 나나 정신 똑바로 차리고 살아야 한다는 거야.” “응!” [저 녀석, 내 말뜻이나 아는 건가.] 아무튼 나는 말을 마저 했다. “형은 돌 막 지나고부터 밥값 했으니, 세 살이면 이제 너도 밥값 벌고도 남을 나이란 말이야. 알았어?” “녜에! 형아. 바갑. 바갑. 밍구기. 해.” “그래, 이제부터 너도 밥값 버는 거야.” “녜에!” 민국이는 두 주먹을 불끈 쥐었다. 그날 밤, 나는 세상 아무것도 모르는 민국이 데뷔를 위한 치밀한 플랜을 짜기 시작했다. 민국이는 얼굴이 좀 딸리니 어린아이다운 표정으로 승부를 봐야 한다. 그렇다면 당장 내일부터 민국이에게 연기 수업을 해야 했다. 대한민국 아역계를 평정한 내가 선생님이라니, 민국이는 정말 행운아였다. “성국아, 안 자고 뭐 해?” 막 씻은 아빠가 방 안을 들여다보고 있었다. [아빠, 노크도 없이 이러면 안 되지. 나도 프라이버시가 있다고.] 나는 얼른 달려가서 배꼽 인사를 했다. “안녕히 주무세요.” “성국아, 9시가 넘었어. 이제 자야지. 아빠가 재워줄까?” [그건 정말 사양할게. 차라리 베개 안고 잘 거야.] 나는 얼른 베개를 안고 침대로 뛰어 올라갔다. 아빠는 그런 나를 보며 흐뭇한 미소를 지으며 방 불을 껐다. “성국아, 잘 자.” 나는 눈을 감고 자는 척을 했지만, 머릿속으로는 민국이의 데뷔를 위한 플랜을 짜고 있었다. * * * 유치원 가방을 내던지자마자 나는 민국이에게로 달려갔다. 민국이를 봐주시는 이모님은 내 간식을 챙기러 부엌에 간 타이밍이었다. 나는 민국이를 끌어다가 TV 앞에 앉혔다. 그리고 TV를 켰다. TV 유치원을 하기 전 광고 시간이었다. 시청자들을 고려해서인지 아역들이 나오는 광고들이 연이어 나왔다. “밍구가, 저거 봐.” “헤헤.” 민국이는 그저 입을 벌린 채 광고를 봤다. “밍구가, 입을 좀 더 벌리고 웃어봐.” “헤에헤에.” 민국이는 생각보다 내 지시를 잘 따랐다. “성국아, 민국이 데리고 뭐 하는 거야?” 이모님이 오는 바람에 내 연기 수업은 시작도 제대로 하기 전에 끝이 났다. “성국아, 우유랑 바나나 먹자.” [오늘은 어쩔 수 없군.] 나는 이모님이 내민 우유와 바나나를 먹으며 민국이에게 아역이 나오는 광고만 집중적으로 보여줬다. [우선은 많이 보는 게 공부가 되는 거야.] 민국이는 넋 나간 얼굴로 TV를 쳐다봤다. “엄마 왔어.” 문이 열리면서 엄마와 김미영이 함께 퇴근했다. 김미영은 이제 우리와 같은 아파트 다른 동에 살았다. 수유의 건물을 정리하고, 잠실의 24평 아파트를 사고 나머지 금액으로는 근처의 작은 상가를 두 채 정도 샀다고 들었다. [역시 김미영의 부동산 감각은 탁월해.] 솔직히 재벌로 살다 보니 부동산을 매매하는 일은 나와 크게 관계가 없었다. 태어났을 때부터 서울 가장 비싼 땅에 집이 몇 채나 됐고, 원한다면 어디든 집을 살 수도 있었다. 서울뿐 아니라 뉴욕과 파리 어느 나라에도 말이다. 종종 공장 부지나 본사 이전 등으로 땅을 매입하는 경우가 있었지만, 그런 것은 어차피 회사에 따로 담당하는 전문가들이 있었다. 아무리 싼 땅도 삼전 그룹의 계열사가 들어서는 순간, 도시가 생기고 땅값이 치솟기도 했다. 부동산 시장을 따라가는 게 아니라, 한마디로 부동산 시장 자체를 만드는 역할을 한 것이다. [김미영과 조만간 심도 깊은 대화 좀 나눠야겠어.] 나는 종종걸음으로 김미영에게 다가가 인사를 했다. “안냥하세요.” “성국아, 안 본 사이에 키가 더 큰 것 같은데. 성국이 엄마, 맞죠?” “네, 언니. 성국이 내복 좀 보세요. 석 달 전에 산 건데 벌써 발목 보여요.” “진짜네. 성국이 키도 엄청 크겠다.” [당연하지.] 아빠가 어림잡아 180센티미터. 엄마도 165센티미터가 넘는 키였다. 이런 유전자라면 내 키도 못 해도 아빠는 넘어설 것 같았다. 내가 저번 생에서 178센티미터였으니, 이번 생에서는 180센티미터를 드디어 넘어볼 수도 있을 것 같았다. [아차, 깜빡했네.] 나는 김미영의 손을 잡고 TV 앞으로 끌고 갔다. TV 앞에는 민국이가 있었다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “밍구기.” 나는 손가락으로 민국이를 가리켰다. “민국이가 왜?” “밍구기가 저거 하루 종일 봐요.” 때마침 아역이 나오는 광고였다. 물론 이 시간에 저 광고가 나온다는 것은 이미 알고 있었다. 김미영은 예리한 눈으로 민국이를 살폈다. 민국이는 내 교육 덕분에 광고 모델을 보면서 표정을 흉내 냈다. 이런 민국이를 어엿한 기획사 대표 김미영이 놓칠 리가 없었다. “민국아, 지금 혹시 저 표정 따라 한 거야?” “녜에!” “민국아, 너도 저렇게 하고 싶어?” 민국이가 슬쩍 내 눈치를 살폈다. 나는 두 눈을 끔뻑했다. 어서 그렇다고 대답하란 신호였다. “녜에!” “언니, 민국이가 뭐라는 거예요?” “성국이 엄마, 민국이가 TV 광고 보면서 흉내 내는데, 제법인데요.” “성국이 하는 거 보고 따라 하는 건가….” “성국이 엄마, 안 그래도 다음 주에 곽 감독님이랑 점심 먹기로 했거든요. 선미 씨 광고 때문에요. 제가 한번 민국이가 응시해볼 만한 광고 알아볼까요?” “민국이를요….” 엄마는 걱정이 앞서는 모양이었다. 나는 얼른 엄마에게 달려가서 다리에 매달렸다. [엄마, 민국이도 이제 지 밥값을 벌어야지. 언제까지 집에서 저렇게 놀릴 거야? 우리처럼 가난한 처지에.] “성국아, 잠깐만.” 엄마는 나를 안아 들고는 민국이에게로 갔다. “민국아, 엄마 좀 봐.” “엄. 마!” 민국이는 헤벌쭉 웃으며 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “민국아, 너도 TV 나오고 싶어. 형아처럼?” 나는 얼른 그러라는 눈빛을 민국이에게 보냈다. 민국이는 해맑은 얼굴로 크게 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 몰래 엄지손가락을 치켜세웠다. [전민국, 잘했어.] * * * 유치원이 끝나자마자 나는 엄마 손을 잡고 민국이와 함께 오디션장으로 향했다. 곽 감독이 새로 찍는 세제 광고에 나올 아역이 필요하단 연락이 왔기 때문이다. 오디션장은 곽 감독의 광고 회사였다. 학동역 부근에 위치한 곽 감독의 광고 회사는 단독 주택을 개조한 곳으로 마당에는 거북이가 돌아다니고 있었다. 내가 민국이의 손을 잡고 들어서자 나를 알아본 조연출 한 명이 반갑게 인사를 했다. “성국아, 나 기억나? 진희 누나야.” [기억나지, 당연히. 진희 누나, 맨날 뒤에서 곽 감독 성격 이상하다고 투덜거렸잖아. 근데 아직도 잘 다니네.] “와, 네가 성국이 동생이구나. 동생도 정말 잘생겼네요.” [그 말은 오늘만 용서해줄게. 오늘은 민국이 오디션이니까.] 조연출은 우리를 대기장으로 안내했다. “세 살에서 다섯 살까지 오디션 보거든요. 어머니, 성국이도 보는 거 어때요? 성국이가 광고계를 떠나서 사람들이 얼마나 아쉬워하는지 몰라요.” “성국이는 요즘 공부하느라 정신이 없어요.” “아쉽네요.” 광고 회사 안쪽에 마련된 대기 장소에는 이미 열댓 명의 아이들이 있었다. 조연출의 말대로 세 살부터 다섯 살 정도로 보이는 아이들이었다. 내가 대기실에 들어서자 순간 모두 긴장한 기색이 역력했다. 아무리 내가 이 업계를 떠난 지 좀 됐지만, 모두들 나를 기억하고 있었다. 이때, 한 아이의 엄마가 나를 보더니 투덜거렸다. “성국이도 오디션 보는 거예요?” “아니에요. 성국이는 오늘 동생 때문에 같이 온 거예요.” 조연출이 얼른 설명을 했지만, 대기실의 분위기는 여전히 차가웠다. “누구 동생이라고 특혜 더 주고 그런 거 아니죠?” 떽떽거리는 여자의 목소리가 익숙했다. [어디서 들어본 목소리인데.] 나는 여자와 여자의 곁에 앉은 남자아이를 쳐다봤다. 내 또래로 보이는 남자아이는 동그란 눈에 별 특색 없는 얼굴이었다. 그리고 그 아이의 엄마로 보이는 여자는. [맞다! 덕풍 제지!] 남자아이의 이름은 이재희. 내 인생 첫 오디션에서 처음으로 좌절을 보게 해준 녀석이었다. 덕풍 제지 손자라는 이유로 광고 모델로 발탁됐지만, 곱게 자라서 세상 물정 모르던 녀석은 수없이 NG를 낸 바람에 촬영 중에 잘리고 말았다. 재능도 없으면서 아직도 광고계를 어슬렁거리고 있는 모양이었다. 방금 전 특혜니 뭐니 따진 여자는 아들에게 추억을 만들어준단 이유로 덕풍 제지 백으로 모두를 들러리 세우고 광고 모델로 만든 덕풍 제지의 며느리였다. 그런데 어딘가 여자의 행색이 조금 초라해 보였다. 그때도 들고 있던 샤랭의 가방은 모서리가 해졌고, 분명 그때도 입고 있었던 것 같은 트위드 재질의 재킷과 스커트도 낡아 보였다. 명품이지만 유행 지난 느낌이 확실히 있었다. 나는 엄마를 올려다봤다. 4년 전 엄마는 돌이 막 지난 나를 안고 버스를 타고 이태원에 있는 삼전 기획에 오디션을 보러 갔었다. 그때 엄마는 유일한 외출복인 검은색 원피스를 조금 창피해했다. 하지만 지금의 엄마는 비록 명품은 아니지만 깔끔한 재킷에 청바지를 매치해서 입었다. 작년에 아빠가 생일 선물이라며 사준 국내 브랜드의 핸드백도 들고 있었다. 그리고 그때나 지금이나 엄마는 여전히 아름다웠다. 나는 저벅저벅 이재희에게 걸어갔다. “안냥.” 내가 먼저 환하게 웃자 이재희는 영문도 모른 채 배시시 웃으며 인사를 받아줬다. “안냥.” 이재희의 엄마는 못마땅한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 나 기억하니?” [물론 기억하지. 중소기업 며느리.] 하지만 보통의 아이들은 결코 기억할 수 없는 시간이었다. 나는 모른 척 정중하게 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “우리 아들 대타로 네가 광고 찍어서 대박 난 거야. 그러니까 네가 광고 찍은 거 다 우리 덕분이야.” [할 말은 많지만, 하지 않겠어. 중소기업 며느리.] 나는 입을 앙다물었다. “성구가. 나 사인 좀.” 이재희는 예전에는 좀 예민해 보였지만, 엄마만큼 성격이 나쁘지는 않은 모양이었다. 나는 이재희가 내민 종이에 전성국 이름을 선명히 적어줬다. “고마워, 성구가.” “재희야.” “응?” “카메라 앞에선 무조건 웃어.” 이건 내가 이재희에게 주는 연기 팁이었다. 어쨌든 이 녀석이 그때 내 말을 듣고 임선미의 성형한 코를 가격해준 덕분에 내가 이 자리에 있는 것이기도 했다. 이재희는 알 듯 모를 듯 한 얼굴로 고개를 살짝 까딱였다. “재희야, 머리 좀 다시 만지자.” 덕풍 제지 며느리는 신경질적으로 재희와 나를 떨어뜨려 났다. 나는 다시 민국이 옆으로 돌아왔다. 벌써 넉살 좋은 몇 명의 아이 엄마들이 다가와서 나에게 사인을 청했다. 이때, 안에서 이재희를 호출하는 목소리가 들렸다. “재희야, 어서 가자.” 이재희는 엄마의 재촉에 못 이겨 오디션장 안으로 들어가면서 나를 흘끔 쳐다봤다. 나는 눈을 찡끗해줬다. “근데 저 여자는 맨날 만나네.” 나에게 사인을 받던 여자가 중얼거렸다. “저분 아세요?” 엄마가 조심스레 물었다. 사실 엄마도 덕풍 제지 며느리를 한눈에 알아봤지만 모른 척하고 있었다. “예전 덕풍 제지 며느리잖아요. 근데 덕풍 제지 회장이 젊은 여자한테 빠져서 재산을 모조리 그 여자한테 넘기는 바람에 저 집 아들들은 건져서 나온 게 없대요. 다들 순식간에 망해서 폐인 되고, 아들 하나 어떻게든 연예인 만들어서 성공시키려고 돌아다니는데. 제가 보기에 아들이 영 재능이 없어요.” “그렇군요.” 엄마의 표정이 조금 시무룩해졌다. 그러더니 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 너 첫 광고 오디션 때 네가 인사한 애랑 같이 경쟁했었어. 돌 막 지난 때라 기억 안 날 거야.” [엄마, 뭔 소리야. 나 다 기억해.] 김미영도 혀를 낮게 찼다. “아, 저 집이 덕풍 제지였군요.” “언니도 알아요?” “저 집 소문 파다했어요. 며느리가 그때 삼전 기획에 돈 주고 광고 하나 밀어 넣었다가 성국이한테 밀렸잖아요. 회사에서도 말 많았어요.” 달칵. 오디션장 문이 열리면서 이재희가 엄마와 나왔다. 꽤 밝은 얼굴이었다. 조연출이 웃으며 손을 흔들었다. “민국이 차례예요.” “언니, 제가 같이 갈게요. 성국이 좀 봐주세요.” 나는 민국이 손을 꼭 잡고 눈을 마주쳤다. [전민국. 너도 이제 세 살이야. 형 말 알지?] 민국이는 다부지게 고개를 끄덕이며 힘차게 대답했다. “바압갑!”","completion":"제가 지금까지 번역해 준 이야기는 독특하고 창의적인 상상력으로 가득 찬 이야기입니다. 주인공인 전성국과 그의 동생 전민국의 이야기를 통해, 가난한 가정에서 태어나도 노력과 재능으로 상황을 극복하려는 의지를 보여줍니다. 전성국은 어린 나이에도 불구하고 가족의 경제적 상황을 개선하기 위해 동생을 광고 모델로 만들기 위한 노력을 합니다. 이 과정에서 사회적인 문제와 가정 내의 따뜻함 등 다양한 주제를 다루며, 캐릭터들 간의 관계를 섬세하게 그려냅니다. 이 이야기는 가족 간의 사랑과 희생, 그리고 성공을 위한 끊임없는 노력의 중요성을 강조합니다. 또한 전성국의 목표 달성을 위한 노력과 결심, 민국이가 모델로서의 첫 걸음을 떼는 모습은 독자들에게 희망과 용기를 줍니다. 본문은 가족의 의미와 어린아이들이 겪는 성장 과정에 대한 따뜻한 시선을 제공하며, 이를 통해 독자들로 하여금 자신의 삶을 돌아보게 만듭니다. 이 이야기는 단순한 픽션을 넘어, 사랑과 응원, 그리고 가족의 중요성에 대한 교훈을 전달합니다. 전성국과 전민국 형제의 이야기는 많은 이들의 마음에 울림을 주며, 우리 모두가 가지고 있는 희망과 꿈에 대해 다시 한번 생각해 보게 합니다."},{"prompt":"(In the town of Axel...)

[정말 비범하게 태어난 것도 골치 아픈 일이구나.] 나는 심드렁한 얼굴로 짜장면을 먹었다. 오늘 저녁은 특별히 나를 위한 짜장면이었다. 아빠가 짧게 지금의 상황에 대해서 설명을 했다. “양 비서님께서는 성국이는 미국 유학 보내는 게 어떻겠냐고 그러시더라고요. 이번에 회장님 자녀들이 모두 미국 가는데, 거기 함께요. 아무래도 성국이 같은 영재를 국내에서는 교육시키기 어려울 것 같다고 하시면서요.” 김미영은 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 흘금 김미영의 짜장면을 쳐다봤다. [김 매니저, 안 먹을 거면 내가 좀 더 먹어도 될까?] 요즘 키가 크느라 배 속이 계속 헛헛했다. 김미영은 내가 짜장면을 훔쳐보자, 빙긋 미소를 지으며 자신의 짜장을 덜어줬다. “성국아, 많이 먹어.” “네에, 감사합니다.” 나는 바르게 인사를 하고는 짜장면을 호로록 흡입했다. “부모님들 생각은 어떠세요?” 김미영이 엄마와 아빠를 조심스레 쳐다봤다. “저희야 아이랑 같이 있고 싶은 마음이 더 크긴 한데요. 언니, 그래도 성국이 미래를 위해서면 미국으로 가야 하지 않을까요? 이런 천재를 저희가 키우다가 평범해지면 어떻게 해요.” [엄마, 나 천재 아니야. 아이큐 겨우 121이라고. 에휴.] “성국이 아버지는 어떠세요?” “소영이는 아무래도 엄마니까 교육 문제에 좀 더 예민해요. 근데, 어제 글쎄, 성국이가 안 싸던 오줌을 쌌더라고요.” “아빠!” 나는 버럭 소리를 질렀다. 아빠가 웃으면서 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국이 창피하구나.” [하아, 이건 비밀이라고!] 김미영과 엄마의 웃음소리가 들렸다. 나는 고개를 저었다. [어른들이란….] 정말 종종 어른들은 어린아이가 얼마나 예민한지 잊을 때가 있었다. 나는 그냥 짜장면에 집중하기로 했다. 그리고 유학에 대한 나의 생각은 이미 정해져 있었다. “자기야, 성국이 창피해하잖아. 그만해.” “알았어, 알았어. 실수 같은 거 잘 안 하는 성국이가 실수하니까, 성국이도 아직 애기지. 그런 생각도 들고, 난 좋더라고.” [애기 아니거든.] 나는 짜장면을 후루룩 먹곤 입을 앙다물었다. “그럼, 성국이 아버지는 성국이 유학 반대 입장이신 거네요?” “지금은 좀 이르지 않나 싶어요. 겨우 다섯 살이잖아요. 입는 거, 씻는 거 다 돌봐줘야 하는 나이라고요. 아무리 삼전 그룹에서 보조해 주신다고 해도 부모만 못하잖아요.” [아빠, 내가 말을 안 했나 본데. 저번 생에서는 다섯 살 때부터 외국 수없이 왔다 갔다 했어. 엄마, 아빠는 당연히 없었고. 의전팀이 있긴 했네.] “성국이 아빠는 그런데, 나는 이 기회 놓치기가 아깝고 그래요, 언니.” “두 사람 마음 다 이해되네.” 나는 호로록 짜장면을 먹었다. 김미영이 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너는 어때?” [흠….] 나는 이성을 다잡고 저번 생의 전성국이었다면 어떤 결정을 했을까에 대해서 고민했다. 이미 저번 생에서 다 경험한 유학이라 선뜻 내키지 않는 게 속마음이었다. 그리고 나는 그들이 생각하는 만큼의 천재도 아니었다. 저번 생의 경험치가 누적되어 무척 뛰어난 아이일 뿐이었다. 미국의 영재교육 시스템 아래에서 아마 그들은 내가 노벨상 하나쯤 탈 인재로 성장하기를 바랄지도 모르지만, 나는 그 정도는 아니었다. 이건 냉철한 판단이었다. 그렇다면 안락한 엄마, 아빠 품에서 유년기를 보내는 게 맞지 않을까? 짜장면이나 실컷 먹으면서. 뭐, 이런 여러 가지 생각이 들었다. “어, 민국아! 민국아, 왜 그래?” 이야기를 나누는 동안 민국이가 사라졌다. 엄마가 얼른 안방으로 들어가는 게 보였다. [민국이 녀석, 또 무슨 사고를 친 거야?] 이때, 안방에서 민국이의 처절한 울음소리가 들렸다. “으아앙- 형아- 형아-.” [왜 나를 찾고 그러는 거야. 귀찮게.] “민국아, 왜 그래?” “형아. 형아.” 엄마가 달래도 민국이는 울 뿐이었다. [내가 나서야 하는 건가.] 나는 짜장면 먹던 포크를 놓고 안방으로 걸어갔다. 민국이가 울면서 내 옷이 든 옷장 서랍을 헤집고 있었다. 엄마가 민국이를 말렸다. “민국아, 왜 그래. 그거 형아 옷이야.” “으아아앙-.” [참 시끄럽게 우네.] 민국이는 옷장에서 연신 내 옷을 빼다가 이불 아래에 숨기고 있었다. [민국아, 네가 숨기는 거 다 보여.] 엄마는 민국이를 제지했지만, 민국이는 엄마마저 밀어버리고 옷을 계속 숨겼다. 나는 얼른 민국이한테 다가갔다. [너, 손님도 와 있는데 떼쓰면 형아가 혼낸다.] 민국이의 얼굴은 이미 눈물, 콧물 범벅이었다. “형아.” [형아 왜 찾아?] 민국이는 갑자기 눈물, 콧물 범벅이 된 손으로 나를 꽉 안았다. [이 녀석이 언제 이렇게 힘이 세졌지?] “놔아, 민국아.” 내가 몸을 틀수록 민국이는 나를 더 세게 안았다. “형아. 가디 마.” “어?” “형아. 가디 마.” [너 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 형, 미국 유학 가지 말라고?] “형아. 밍구기랑 여기 사라. 가디 마.” 나는 순간 몸이 굳었다. 이 녀석이 내 옷을 숨긴 것은 내가 떠날까 싶어서였다. 민국이는 나를 꽉 안고는 놓아주지 않았다. 하도 울어도 쉰 목소리로 계속해서 중얼거렸다. “형아. 가디 마. 밍구기랑 여기 사라. 가디 마.” 울컥. 눈시울이 뜨거워졌다. [왜 또 감동시키는 건데!] 저번 생에서 짧은 연수나 유학을 갈 때에도 동생들은 울지도 말리지도 않았다. 경쟁자가 눈앞에서 사라지는 것만으로도 안도하는 눈치들이었다. “크응-.” 민국이는 코를 쭉 들이켰다. [더럽게.] 나는 한 손으로 휴지를 집으려고 했지만, 민국이 때문에 손이 닿지 않았다. “밍구가, 이거 놔.” “시로, 형아. 어디도 못 가.” [정말 이 녀석.] 나는 어쩔 수 없이 대답했다. “밍구가, 형아 안 가. 아무 데도 안 가.” “진따?” 밍구기는 눈물을 뚝 그치고 초롱초롱한 눈으로 나를 올려다봤다. “형아, 진따야?” “응. 형아 안 가.” 나는 단호하게 말했다. * * * 삼성동의 전재형 회장의 집은 한남동의 집과는 사뭇 다른 분위기였다. 한남동이 철의 여왕의 취향에 맞춰서 프렌치 스타일의 인테리어를 추구했다면, 이곳은 전재형 회장의 취향이 그대로 묻어났다. 모던한 가구들과 전재형 회장이 선호하는 잭슨 폴의 작품들이 곳곳에 보였다. 잭슨 폴의 그림은 이제 세계 어느 곳에서도 구하기 힘들었다. 전재형 회장은 막 위스키를 따르던 참이었다. 양 비서가 들어오는 소리가 들렸다. 한남동 자택에서와 똑같은 것은 양 비서밖에 없었다. 양 비서 역시 전재형 회장을 따라서 인근으로 이사를 온 터였다. “회장님 취향이 그대로 묻어나는 인테리어네요.” “한남동 집은 너무 안락해서 영 내 취향이 아니었어.” “잭슨 폴 작품을 이번에 많이 구매하셨는데, 꽤 마음에 드시나 봐요?” “난 고전보다는 모던한 게 취향이거든.” 전재형 회장은 위스키를 한 잔 더 따라 양 비서에게 내밀었다. “이사하느라 양 비서도 수고했어.” “제 일인걸요.” 양 비서는 잔을 받으며 낮게 고개를 숙였다. 사실 오늘은 보고할 일이 있었다. “태국 군과 미진 양 유학은 잘 진행 중입니다. 사모님께서도 초기에는 같이 가셔서 적응할 때까지 같이 계실 것 같습니다.” “당연한 일이지. 태국이 사고 안 치게 주의 좀 기울이게.” “걱정 마십시오. 동기 중에 태국이 친구들도 몇 명 심어뒀고, 모두 저희에게 보고할 것입니다.” 전재형 회장은 고개를 끄덕였다. 자신의 유학 시절에도 그랬다. 돌아가신 아버지 전주신 전 회장 역시 전재형 회장이 유학하는 곳곳마다 친구라는 이름으로 몇 명을 심어두고 보고를 받았다. 지금 전재형 회장이 궁금한 건 따로 있었다. “그리고 성국 군은….” 전재형 회장의 오른쪽 눈썹이 올라갔다. 아이들의 이야기를 들을 때보다 더 신경 쓰이는 눈치였다. “성국 군은 이번에 같이 안 가기로 결정했습니다.” “의외인데….” 전재형 회장의 생각으로는 도저히 납득이 안 됐다. 이 좋은 기회를 날려 버리다니. “혹 성국이 부모들이 말린 건가. 평범한 사람들은 항상 그렇잖아. 가족이 더 중요하고, 아이를 끼고 자신들이 돌보아야 한다고 말이야.” “물론 성국이 부모님의 입장은 그런 부분이 있었습니다. 하지만 성국이 어머니 같은 경우에는 유학을 꽤 진지하게 고민하셨던 것 같습니다. 아무래도 더 좋은 환경에서 교육시키고 싶은 욕심이 있으셨거든요.” “그런데?” “성국이가 결정한 일이라고 합니다.” “겨우 다섯 살한테 결정을 맡겼다는 말인가?” “가족회의를 했다고 합니다.” “흠….” 전재형 회장은 위스키를 단숨에 들이켰다. 정말 납득 불가능한 일이었다. 인생의 단계를 점프할 수 있는 이런 소중한 기회를 날려 버리다니. “성국이가 뛰어난 아이이긴 하지만 아직 다섯 살이라 부모들의 손이 많이 갈 나이 아니겠습니까. 성국이 정도면 앞으로도 충분히 지켜보다 유학을 보내도 될 것 같습니다.” “그렇긴 하겠지. 다섯 살. 어리긴 하지.” 전재형 회장은 아쉬움을 삼켰다. 삼전 그룹을 이끌 차세대 인재라면 당연히 앞으로는 그 기회를 놓치지 않을 것이라고 믿었다. * * * 유학 이야기가 오간 이후로 민국이는 내 곁에서 떨어지지 않았다. 밥을 먹을 때도. 옷을 갈아입을 때도. 심지어 화장실을 갈 때도 껌딱지처럼 붙어 다녔다. “형아. 응아해?” “보면 몰라?” 내 인내심도 점점 바닥이 나고 있었다. 끄응. 나는 마지막 힘을 주고는 얼른 변기의 물을 내렸다. “형아, 밍구기도.” “너도 응아 마렵다고?” “응.” 나는 밍구기를 끌고 유아용 변기에 앉혔다. “힘줘.” “으응. 형아.” 민국이는 힘을 주면서도 내 손을 꼭 쥔 채였다. [경쟁자 녀석이 이젠 껌딱지가 되다니.] 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. 그래도 다행인 것은 이 녀석 덕분에 이성적으로 판단을 다시 할 수 있었다는 것이다. 내가 겨우 민국이가 날 붙잡고 오열해서 유학을 포기한 것으로 여긴다면 큰 오산이다. 민국이와 손을 잡고 잔 그날, 나는 내가 한 가지 사실을 간과했다는 것을 깨달았다. 그건 바로 삼전 그룹이었다. 만약 지금부터 삼전 그룹의 후원까지 받아 유학까지 간다면 나는 이번 생에서도 삼전 그룹의 그늘에서 벗어나기 어려웠다. 그건 내가 원한 삶이 아니었다. 내가 원한 진짜 삶은 이번 생에서 나 스스로 대한민국 최고가 되는 일이다. “형아, 응아 끄읕.” 민국이가 나를 향해 엉덩이를 내밀었다. [지금 뒤도 닦아달란 거냐?] “형아.” “하아….” 단전에서부터 깊은 한숨이 흘러나왔다. [나 정말 유학 포기한 거 잘한 거지?] 나는 한 손으로 코를 잡고, 휴지를 집어 들었다.","completion":"Episode 37 A family meeting was held. Kim Mi-young, who is now like a family member, was also present. Min-guk also took a seat. The reason everyone gathered was all because of me. Specifically, my study abroad issue. [Being born exceptionally is also a headache.] I ate my black bean noodles with a sullen face. Tonight's dinner was specially for me, black bean noodles. Dad briefly explained the current situation. \\"Secretary Yang suggested that it might be a good idea to send Seong-guk to study in the USA. Since the chairman's children are all going to the USA, he could go with them. It seems difficult to educate a genius like Seong-guk domestically.\\" Kim Mi-young nodded her head. I sneakily glanced at Kim Mi-young's black bean noodles. [Manager Kim, if you're not going to eat, can I have some more?] Lately, I've been feeling hungry all the time because I'm growing. Seeing me eyeing her black bean noodles, Kim Mi-young smiled and scooped some onto my plate. \\"Seong-guk, eat a lot.\\" \\"Yes, thank you.\\" I politely thanked her and slurped the noodles. \\"What do the parents think?\\" Kim Mi-young cautiously looked at mom and dad. \\"We would rather be with our child, but for Seong-guk's future, shouldn't he go to the USA? What if we raise such a genius and he becomes ordinary.\\" [Mom, I'm not a genius. My IQ is just 121. Sigh.] \\"What about Seong-guk's father?\\" \\"So-young is more sensitive about education because she's a mother. But, yesterday, Seong-guk unexpectedly wet the bed.\\" \\"Dad!\\" I shouted in anger. Dad laughed and patted my head. \\"Seong-guk is embarrassed.\\" [Ha, that was supposed to be a secret!] I heard Kim Mi-young and mom's laughter. I shook my head. [Adults...] Adults often forget how sensitive a child can be. I decided to focus on my black bean noodles. And my thoughts on studying abroad were already decided. \\"Honey, Seong-guk is embarrassed. Let's stop.\\" \\"Alright, alright. It's rare for Seong-guk to make a mistake, so it made me think he's still a baby. I liked that.\\" [I'm not a baby.] I slurped my noodles and clamped my mouth shut. \\"So, Seong-guk's father is against the study abroad?\\" \\"It seems a bit early now. He's only five years old. He needs care for dressing, washing, and everything. Even if Samsung Group supports us, it's not the same as parents.\\" [Dad, I didn't say this, but in my previous life, I traveled abroad countless times from the age of five. Of course, without mom and dad. There was a protocol team.] \\"Seong-guk's dad, but I think it's a pity to miss this opportunity, sister.\\" \\"I understand both of your feelings.\\" I slurped my noodles. Kim Mi-young looked at me. \\"Seong-guk, what do you think?\\" [Hmm...] I pondered what decision I would have made if I were the Seong-guk from my previous life. Having already experienced studying abroad in my previous life, I wasn't keen on it. And I wasn't the genius they thought I was. I was just a child with accumulated experience from my previous life. Under the American education system for gifted children, they might hope I would grow into a talent capable of winning a Nobel Prize, but I wasn't that level. This was a sober judgment. Then, wouldn't it be right to spend my childhood in the comfortable arms of my mom and dad? Eating black bean noodles to my heart's content. Well, these were the various thoughts I had. \\"Hey, Min-guk! Min-guk, what's wrong?\\" While we were talking, Min-guk had disappeared. I saw mom quickly entering the bedroom. [What trouble has Min-guk gotten into now?] Then, from the bedroom, Min-guk's desperate crying was heard. \\"Uwaaah- Brother- Brother-.\\" [Why is he looking for me? So bothersome.] \\"Min-guk, what's wrong?\\" \\"Brother. Brother.\\" Even as mom tried to soothe him, Min-guk just cried. [Do I need to step in?] I put down my fork from eating black bean noodles and walked into the bedroom. Min-guk was crying and rummaging through my clothes in the closet. Mom tried to stop Min-guk. \\"Min-guk, what are you doing? That's brother's clothes.\\" \\"Uwaaah-.\\" [He's making such a fuss.] Min-guk kept taking out my clothes from the closet and hiding them under the blanket. [Min-guk, I can see everything you're hiding.] Mom tried to stop him, but Min-guk pushed her away and continued to hide the clothes. I quickly approached Min-guk. [If you throw a tantrum while we have guests, brother will scold you.] Min-guk's face was already a mess of tears and snot. \\"Brother.\\" [Why are you looking for brother?] Suddenly, Min-guk, with his tear and snot-covered hands, hugged me tightly. [When did this kid get so strong?] \\"Let go, Min-guk.\\" The more I struggled, the tighter Min-guk hugged me. \\"Brother. Don't go.\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Brother. Don't go.\\" [What are you saying now? Brother, don't go study abroad in the USA?] \\"Brother. Stay here with Min-guk. Don't go.\\" I froze for a moment. Min-guk was hiding my clothes because he was afraid I would leave. Min-guk hugged me tightly and wouldn't let go, continuously mumbling with his hoarse voice from crying. \\"Brother. Don't go. Stay here with Min-guk. Don't go.\\" I felt a lump in my throat. [Why are you making me emotional!] In my previous life, when I went on short exchanges or study abroad, my siblings neither cried nor tried to stop me. They seemed relieved just to have a competitor out of sight. \\"Ugh-.\\" Min-guk sniffled. [So gross.] I tried to reach for a tissue with one hand, but I couldn't because of Min-guk. \\"Min-guk, let go.\\" \\"No, brother. You can't go anywhere.\\" [Really, this kid.] I had no choice but to answer. \\"Min-guk, brother won't go. Not anywhere.\\" \\"Really?\\" Min-guk stopped crying and looked up at me with bright eyes. \\"Brother, really?\\" \\"Yeah. Brother won't go.\\" I said firmly. * * * The atmosphere at Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's house in Samseong-dong was quite different from the house in Hannam-dong. If Hannam-dong was decorated in a French style to suit the taste of the Iron Queen, this place reflected Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's preferences. Modern furniture and works by Jackson Pollock, which Chairman Jeon favored, were visible everywhere. Jackson Pollock's paintings were now hard to find anywhere in the world. Chairman Jeon was just pouring a whiskey. Secretary Yang entered. The only thing the same as the Hannam-dong residence was Secretary Yang. Secretary Yang had also moved nearby following Chairman Jeon. \\"The interior really reflects the chairman's taste.\\" \\"The Hannam-dong house was too cozy, not really my style.\\" \\"You've purchased a lot of Jackson Pollock's works recently, you must really like them?\\" \\"I prefer modern to classic.\\" Chairman Jeon poured another glass of whiskey and offered it to Secretary Yang. \\"You've worked hard with the move, Secretary Yang.\\" \\"It's my job.\\" Secretary Yang took the glass and bowed slightly. In fact, there was something to report today. \\"The military in Thailand and Mi-jin's study abroad are progressing well. The madam will also go initially to stay with them until they adapt.\\" \\"Of course. Make sure Tae-guk doesn't cause any trouble.\\" \\"Don't worry. We've planted a few of Tae-guk's friends among the students, and they will all report to us.\\" Chairman Jeon nodded. His own study abroad was the same. The late Chairman Jeon Ju-shin, Chairman Jeon's father, also had a few people planted as friends in every place Chairman Jeon studied abroad to report back. What Chairman Jeon was curious about now was something else. \\"And Seong-guk...\\" Chairman Jeon's right eyebrow raised. He seemed more concerned than when talking about the other children. \\"Seong-guk has decided not to go this time.\\" \\"Unexpected...\\" Chairman Jeon couldn't understand. To let go of such a good opportunity. \\"Did Seong-guk's parents dissuade him? Ordinary people always do that. Family is more important, and they say they need to take care of their child themselves.\\" \\"Of course, Seong-guk's parents had that perspective. But Seong-guk's mother seemed to seriously consider the study abroad. She probably wanted to provide a better educational environment.\\" \\"But?\\" \\"Seong-guk made the decision.\\" \\"Leaving the decision to a mere five-year-old?\\" \\"They had a family meeting.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" Chairman Jeon downed his whiskey in one gulp. It was truly incomprehensible. To throw away such a precious opportunity to jump ahead in life. \\"Seong-guk is indeed a talented child, but he's only five. It's an age that requires a lot of parental care. With Seong-guk's capabilities, it seems we can wait and see before deciding on studying abroad.\\" \\"That may be so. Five years old. Quite young.\\" Chairman Jeon swallowed his disappointment. If he's the next generation talent to lead Samsung Group, he believed that he wouldn't miss such opportunities in the future. * * * After the talk about studying abroad, Min-guk wouldn't leave my side. Whether eating, changing clothes, or even going to the bathroom, he stuck to me like glue. \\"Brother. Poop?\\" \\"Can't you tell?\\" My patience was running thin. Ugh. I exerted my last bit of strength and quickly flushed the toilet. \\"Brother, Min-guk too.\\" \\"You need to poop too?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" I pulled Min-guk to the child's toilet and sat him down. \\"Push.\\" \\"Ugh. Brother.\\" Even as Min-guk exerted himself, he held my hand tightly. [The competitor kid has now become a sticky candy.] I shook my head. But thankfully, because of this kid, I was able to rethink my decision rationally. If I thought I gave up studying abroad just because Min-guk held onto me and cried, that would be a big mistake. The night I held hands with Min-guk, I realized I had overlooked one fact. It was Samsung Group. If I accepted Samsung Group's support and went abroad from now on, I would have difficulty escaping from Samsung Group's shadow in this life. That wasn't the life I wanted. What I truly wanted in this life was to become the best in South Korea on my own. \\"Brother, poop done.\\" Min-guk turned his butt towards me. [Are you asking me to wipe your butt now?] \\"Brother.\\" \\"Sigh...\\" A deep sigh flowed from my core. [Did I really make the right decision not to study abroad?] I held my nose with one hand and picked up the tissue."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[아빠, 노크도 없이 이러면 안 되지. 나도 프라이버시가 있다고.] 나는 얼른 달려가서 배꼽 인사를 했다. “안녕히 주무세요.” “성국아, 9시가 넘었어. 이제 자야지. 아빠가 재워줄까?” [그건 정말 사양할게. 차라리 베개 안고 잘 거야.] 나는 얼른 베개를 안고 침대로 뛰어 올라갔다. 아빠는 그런 나를 보며 흐뭇한 미소를 지으며 방 불을 껐다. “성국아, 잘 자.” 나는 눈을 감고 자는 척을 했지만, 머릿속으로는 민국이의 데뷔를 위한 플랜을 짜고 있었다. * * * 유치원 가방을 내던지자마자 나는 민국이에게로 달려갔다. 민국이를 봐주시는 이모님은 내 간식을 챙기러 부엌에 간 타이밍이었다. 나는 민국이를 끌어다가 TV 앞에 앉혔다. 그리고 TV를 켰다. TV 유치원을 하기 전 광고 시간이었다. 시청자들을 고려해서인지 아역들이 나오는 광고들이 연이어 나왔다. “밍구가, 저거 봐.” “헤헤.” 민국이는 그저 입을 벌린 채 광고를 봤다. “밍구가, 입을 좀 더 벌리고 웃어봐.” “헤에헤에.” 민국이는 생각보다 내 지시를 잘 따랐다. “성국아, 민국이 데리고 뭐 하는 거야?” 이모님이 오는 바람에 내 연기 수업은 시작도 제대로 하기 전에 끝이 났다. “성국아, 우유랑 바나나 먹자.” [오늘은 어쩔 수 없군.] 나는 이모님이 내민 우유와 바나나를 먹으며 민국이에게 아역이 나오는 광고만 집중적으로 보여줬다. [우선은 많이 보는 게 공부가 되는 거야.] 민국이는 넋 나간 얼굴로 TV를 쳐다봤다. “엄마 왔어.” 문이 열리면서 엄마와 김미영이 함께 퇴근했다. 김미영은 이제 우리와 같은 아파트 다른 동에 살았다. 수유의 건물을 정리하고, 잠실의 24평 아파트를 사고 나머지 금액으로는 근처의 작은 상가를 두 채 정도 샀다고 들었다. [역시 김미영의 부동산 감각은 탁월해.] 솔직히 재벌로 살다 보니 부동산을 매매하는 일은 나와 크게 관계가 없었다. 태어났을 때부터 서울 가장 비싼 땅에 집이 몇 채나 됐고, 원한다면 어디든 집을 살 수도 있었다. 서울뿐 아니라 뉴욕과 파리 어느 나라에도 말이다. 종종 공장 부지나 본사 이전 등으로 땅을 매입하는 경우가 있었지만, 그런 것은 어차피 회사에 따로 담당하는 전문가들이 있었다. 아무리 싼 땅도 삼전 그룹의 계열사가 들어서는 순간, 도시가 생기고 땅값이 치솟기도 했다. 부동산 시장을 따라가는 게 아니라, 한마디로 부동산 시장 자체를 만드는 역할을 한 것이다. [김미영과 조만간 심도 깊은 대화 좀 나눠야겠어.] 나는 종종걸음으로 김미영에게 다가가 인사를 했다. “안냥하세요.” “성국아, 안 본 사이에 키가 더 큰 것 같은데. 성국이 엄마, 맞죠?” “네, 언니. 성국이 내복 좀 보세요. 석 달 전에 산 건데 벌써 발목 보여요.” “진짜네. 성국이 키도 엄청 크겠다.” [당연하지.] 아빠가 어림잡아 180센티미터. 엄마도 165센티미터가 넘는 키였다. 이런 유전자라면 내 키도 못 해도 아빠는 넘어설 것 같았다. 내가 저번 생에서 178센티미터였으니, 이번 생에서는 180센티미터를 드디어 넘어볼 수도 있을 것 같았다. [아차, 깜빡했네.] 나는 김미영의 손을 잡고 TV 앞으로 끌고 갔다. TV 앞에는 민국이가 있었다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “밍구기.” 나는 손가락으로 민국이를 가리켰다. “민국이가 왜?” “밍구기가 저거 하루 종일 봐요.” 때마침 아역이 나오는 광고였다. 물론 이 시간에 저 광고가 나온다는 것은 이미 알고 있었다. 김미영은 예리한 눈으로 민국이를 살폈다. 민국이는 내 교육 덕분에 광고 모델을 보면서 표정을 흉내 냈다. 이런 민국이를 어엿한 기획사 대표 김미영이 놓칠 리가 없었다. “민국아, 지금 혹시 저 표정 따라 한 거야?” “녜에!” “민국아, 너도 저렇게 하고 싶어?” 민국이가 슬쩍 내 눈치를 살폈다. 나는 두 눈을 끔뻑했다. 어서 그렇다고 대답하란 신호였다. “녜에!” “언니, 민국이가 뭐라는 거예요?” “성국이 엄마, 민국이가 TV 광고 보면서 흉내 내는데, 제법인데요.” “성국이 하는 거 보고 따라 하는 건가….” “성국이 엄마, 안 그래도 다음 주에 곽 감독님이랑 점심 먹기로 했거든요. 선미 씨 광고 때문에요. 제가 한번 민국이가 응시해볼 만한 광고 알아볼까요?” “민국이를요….” 엄마는 걱정이 앞서는 모양이었다. 나는 얼른 엄마에게 달려가서 다리에 매달렸다. [엄마, 민국이도 이제 지 밥값을 벌어야지. 언제까지 집에서 저렇게 놀릴 거야? 우리처럼 가난한 처지에.] “성국아, 잠깐만.” 엄마는 나를 안아 들고는 민국이에게로 갔다. “민국아, 엄마 좀 봐.” “엄. 마!” 민국이는 헤벌쭉 웃으며 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “민국아, 너도 TV 나오고 싶어. 형아처럼?” 나는 얼른 그러라는 눈빛을 민국이에게 보냈다. 민국이는 해맑은 얼굴로 크게 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 몰래 엄지손가락을 치켜세웠다. [전민국, 잘했어.] * * * 유치원이 끝나자마자 나는 엄마 손을 잡고 민국이와 함께 오디션장으로 향했다. 곽 감독이 새로 찍는 세제 광고에 나올 아역이 필요하단 연락이 왔기 때문이다. 오디션장은 곽 감독의 광고 회사였다. 학동역 부근에 위치한 곽 감독의 광고 회사는 단독 주택을 개조한 곳으로 마당에는 거북이가 돌아다니고 있었다. 내가 민국이의 손을 잡고 들어서자 나를 알아본 조연출 한 명이 반갑게 인사를 했다. “성국아, 나 기억나? 진희 누나야.” [기억나지, 당연히. 진희 누나, 맨날 뒤에서 곽 감독 성격 이상하다고 투덜거렸잖아. 근데 아직도 잘 다니네.] “와, 네가 성국이 동생이구나. 동생도 정말 잘생겼네요.” [그 말은 오늘만 용서해줄게. 오늘은 민국이 오디션이니까.] 조연출은 우리를 대기장으로 안내했다. “세 살에서 다섯 살까지 오디션 보거든요. 어머니, 성국이도 보는 거 어때요? 성국이가 광고계를 떠나서 사람들이 얼마나 아쉬워하는지 몰라요.” “성국이는 요즘 공부하느라 정신이 없어요.” “아쉽네요.” 광고 회사 안쪽에 마련된 대기 장소에는 이미 열댓 명의 아이들이 있었다. 조연출의 말대로 세 살부터 다섯 살 정도로 보이는 아이들이었다. 내가 대기실에 들어서자 순간 모두 긴장한 기색이 역력했다. 아무리 내가 이 업계를 떠난 지 좀 됐지만, 모두들 나를 기억하고 있었다. 이때, 한 아이의 엄마가 나를 보더니 투덜거렸다. “성국이도 오디션 보는 거예요?” “아니에요. 성국이는 오늘 동생 때문에 같이 온 거예요.” 조연출이 얼른 설명을 했지만, 대기실의 분위기는 여전히 차가웠다. “누구 동생이라고 특혜 더 주고 그런 거 아니죠?” 떽떽거리는 여자의 목소리가 익숙했다. [어디서 들어본 목소리인데.] 나는 여자와 여자의 곁에 앉은 남자아이를 쳐다봤다. 내 또래로 보이는 남자아이는 동그란 눈에 별 특색 없는 얼굴이었다. 그리고 그 아이의 엄마로 보이는 여자는. [맞다! 덕풍 제지!] 남자아이의 이름은 이재희. 내 인생 첫 오디션에서 처음으로 좌절을 보게 해준 녀석이었다. 덕풍 제지 손자라는 이유로 광고 모델로 발탁됐지만, 곱게 자라서 세상 물정 모르던 녀석은 수없이 NG를 낸 바람에 촬영 중에 잘리고 말았다. 재능도 없으면서 아직도 광고계를 어슬렁거리고 있는 모양이었다. 방금 전 특혜니 뭐니 따진 여자는 아들에게 추억을 만들어준단 이유로 덕풍 제지 백으로 모두를 들러리 세우고 광고 모델로 만든 덕풍 제지의 며느리였다. 그런데 어딘가 여자의 행색이 조금 초라해 보였다. 그때도 들고 있던 샤랭의 가방은 모서리가 해졌고, 분명 그때도 입고 있었던 것 같은 트위드 재질의 재킷과 스커트도 낡아 보였다. 명품이지만 유행 지난 느낌이 확실히 있었다. 나는 엄마를 올려다봤다. 4년 전 엄마는 돌이 막 지난 나를 안고 버스를 타고 이태원에 있는 삼전 기획에 오디션을 보러 갔었다. 그때 엄마는 유일한 외출복인 검은색 원피스를 조금 창피해했다. 하지만 지금의 엄마는 비록 명품은 아니지만 깔끔한 재킷에 청바지를 매치해서 입었다. 작년에 아빠가 생일 선물이라며 사준 국내 브랜드의 핸드백도 들고 있었다. 그리고 그때나 지금이나 엄마는 여전히 아름다웠다. 나는 저벅저벅 이재희에게 걸어갔다. “안냥.” 내가 먼저 환하게 웃자 이재희는 영문도 모른 채 배시시 웃으며 인사를 받아줬다. “안냥.” 이재희의 엄마는 못마땅한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 나 기억하니?” [물론 기억하지. 중소기업 며느리.] 하지만 보통의 아이들은 결코 기억할 수 없는 시간이었다. 나는 모른 척 정중하게 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “우리 아들 대타로 네가 광고 찍어서 대박 난 거야. 그러니까 네가 광고 찍은 거 다 우리 덕분이야.” [할 말은 많지만, 하지 않겠어. 중소기업 며느리.] 나는 입을 앙다물었다. “성구가. 나 사인 좀.” 이재희는 예전에는 좀 예민해 보였지만, 엄마만큼 성격이 나쁘지는 않은 모양이었다. 나는 이재희가 내민 종이에 전성국 이름을 선명히 적어줬다. “고마워, 성구가.” “재희야.” “응?” “카메라 앞에선 무조건 웃어.” 이건 내가 이재희에게 주는 연기 팁이었다. 어쨌든 이 녀석이 그때 내 말을 듣고 임선미의 성형한 코를 가격해준 덕분에 내가 이 자리에 있는 것이기도 했다. 이재희는 알 듯 모를 듯 한 얼굴로 고개를 살짝 까딱였다. “재희야, 머리 좀 다시 만지자.” 덕풍 제지 며느리는 신경질적으로 재희와 나를 떨어뜨려 났다. 나는 다시 민국이 옆으로 돌아왔다. 벌써 넉살 좋은 몇 명의 아이 엄마들이 다가와서 나에게 사인을 청했다. 이때, 안에서 이재희를 호출하는 목소리가 들렸다. “재희야, 어서 가자.” 이재희는 엄마의 재촉에 못 이겨 오디션장 안으로 들어가면서 나를 흘끔 쳐다봤다. 나는 눈을 찡끗해줬다. “근데 저 여자는 맨날 만나네.” 나에게 사인을 받던 여자가 중얼거렸다. “저분 아세요?” 엄마가 조심스레 물었다. 사실 엄마도 덕풍 제지 며느리를 한눈에 알아봤지만 모른 척하고 있었다. “예전 덕풍 제지 며느리잖아요. 근데 덕풍 제지 회장이 젊은 여자한테 빠져서 재산을 모조리 그 여자한테 넘기는 바람에 저 집 아들들은 건져서 나온 게 없대요. 다들 순식간에 망해서 폐인 되고, 아들 하나 어떻게든 연예인 만들어서 성공시키려고 돌아다니는데. 제가 보기에 아들이 영 재능이 없어요.” “그렇군요.” 엄마의 표정이 조금 시무룩해졌다. 그러더니 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 너 첫 광고 오디션 때 네가 인사한 애랑 같이 경쟁했었어. 돌 막 지난 때라 기억 안 날 거야.” [엄마, 뭔 소리야. 나 다 기억해.] 김미영도 혀를 낮게 찼다. “아, 저 집이 덕풍 제지였군요.” “언니도 알아요?” “저 집 소문 파다했어요. 며느리가 그때 삼전 기획에 돈 주고 광고 하나 밀어 넣었다가 성국이한테 밀렸잖아요. 회사에서도 말 많았어요.” 달칵. 오디션장 문이 열리면서 이재희가 엄마와 나왔다. 꽤 밝은 얼굴이었다. 조연출이 웃으며 손을 흔들었다. “민국이 차례예요.” “언니, 제가 같이 갈게요. 성국이 좀 봐주세요.” 나는 민국이 손을 꼭 잡고 눈을 마주쳤다. [전민국. 너도 이제 세 살이야. 형 말 알지?] 민국이는 다부지게 고개를 끄덕이며 힘차게 대답했다. “바압갑!”","completion":"Episode 38 After doing his business, Minguk with his refreshing face kept grinning at me continuously. I stared hard at Minguk. \\"Big bro.\\" \\"Mingoo. From now on, listen well to what big bro says.\\" \\"Okay!\\" His response was good. \\"Now that you're three years old, you should know about our family's situation. Understand?\\" Minguk tilted his head in confusion. I grabbed Minguk's head and fixed his gaze. \\"Focus here.\\" \\"Okay!\\" Again, his response was good. \\"Mingoo. Our mom and dad are orphans of this world. That means, to survive in South Korea, both you and I need to stay sharp and live wisely.\\" \\"Okay!\\" [I wonder if he even understands what I'm saying.] Anyway, I finished what I had to say. \\"Since I started earning my keep right after turning one, now that you're three, it's time you started earning more than your keep. Got it?\\" \\"Yess! Big bro. Happy. Happy. Mingoo. Do.\\" \\"Right, from now on, you'll also be earning your keep.\\" \\"Yess!\\" Minguk clenched his fists tightly. That night, I began devising a meticulous plan for Minguk's debut, oblivious to the world. Since Minguk's face was a bit lacking, he had to win with expressions typical of a child. That meant I had to start giving Minguk acting lessons from tomorrow. Being the teacher, having conquered the child actor scene in South Korea, Minguk was truly lucky. \\"Sungkook, what are you doing up so late?\\" Freshly bathed, dad peeked into the room. [Dad, you can't just come in without knocking. I have my privacy too.] I quickly ran over and gave him a belly button greeting. \\"Good night.\\" \\"Sungkook, it's past 9. Time to sleep. Should dad put you to bed?\\" [I'll have to decline that. I'd rather hug a pillow to sleep.] I quickly grabbed a pillow and jumped onto the bed. Dad watched me with a pleased smile and turned off the room light. \\"Sungkook, sleep well.\\" I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep, but in my head, I was planning for Minguk's debut. * * * As soon as I threw my kindergarten bag aside, I rushed to Minguk. The timing was perfect as the auntie looking after Minguk had gone to the kitchen to prepare my snack. I pulled Minguk to sit in front of the TV and turned it on. It was commercial time before the TV kindergarten program. Considering the audience, commercials featuring child actors followed one after another. \\"Mingoo, look at that.\\" \\"Hehe.\\" Minguk just watched the commercials with his mouth open. \\"Mingoo, try opening your mouth wider and laugh.\\" \\"Heeheehee.\\" Minguk followed my instructions better than expected. \\"Sungkook, what are you doing with Minguk?\\" Our acting lesson was abruptly ended before it could properly start because the auntie came back. \\"Sungkook, let's have some milk and bananas.\\" [Can't be helped today.] While eating the milk and bananas provided by the auntie, I made sure Minguk focused only on commercials featuring child actors. [Watching a lot is also a form of learning.] Minguk watched the TV with a vacant expression. \\"Mom's home.\\" The door opened, and mom came back from work with Kim Miyoung. Kim Miyoung now lived in a different building in the same apartment complex as us. After settling the building in Suyu, she bought a 24-pyeong apartment in Jamsil and invested the remaining money in a couple of small commercial properties nearby. [Kim Miyoung's real estate sense is truly exceptional.] Honestly, dealing with real estate transactions wasn't much of my concern, living as a chaebol. From birth, I had several houses on Seoul's most expensive lands, and if I wanted, I could buy a house anywhere, not just in Seoul but also in New York and Paris. Occasionally, there were land purchases for factory sites or headquarters relocation, but those were handled by the company's dedicated experts. Even the cheapest land would become a city and its value would skyrocket the moment a Samsung Group affiliate moved in. In other words, we didn't follow the real estate market; we essentially created it. [I should have a deep conversation with Kim Miyoung soon.] I approached Kim Miyoung with a trot and greeted her. \\"Hello.\\" \\"Sungkook, you seem to have grown taller. You're Sungkook's mom, right?\\" \\"Yes, sister. Look at Sungkook's underwear. Bought it three months ago, and it's already showing his ankles.\\" \\"Really. Sungkook's going to be tall.\\" [Of course.] Dad was roughly 180 centimeters tall, and mom was over 165 centimeters. With such genetics, I was likely to surpass dad's height. In my previous life, I was 178 centimeters tall, so in this life, I might finally surpass 180 centimeters. [Oh, I forgot.] I grabbed Kim Miyoung's hand and led her to the TV. Minguk was there. \\"Sungkook, what's up?\\" \\"Mingoo.\\" I pointed at Minguk. \\"What about Minguk?\\" \\"Mingoo watches that all day.\\" It was a commercial featuring a child actor, which I knew would be on at this time. Kim Miyoung observed Minguk with sharp eyes. Thanks to my training, Minguk mimicked the expressions of the commercial models. Kim Miyoung wouldn't miss such a sight as a competent agency CEO. \\"Minguk, did you just imitate that expression?\\" \\"Yess!\\" \\"Minguk, do you want to do that too?\\" Minguk glanced at me cautiously. I blinked twice, signaling him to say yes. \\"Yess!\\" \\"Sungkook's mom, what did Minguk say?\\" \\"Sungkook's mom, Minguk imitated the commercial perfectly.\\" \\"Sungkook must have influenced him...\\" \\"Sungkook's mom, I have lunch with Director Kwak next week because of Sunmi's commercial. Should I look into commercials that Minguk could audition for?\\" \\"For Minguk...\\" Mom seemed worried. I quickly ran to mom and clung to her legs. [Mom, Minguk should start earning his keep too. How long will he just play around at home? Given our poor circumstances.] \\"Sungkook, wait a moment.\\" Mom picked me up and went to Minguk. \\"Minguk, look at mom.\\" \\"Mom. Ma!\\" Minguk looked at mom with a wide smile. \\"Minguk, do you want to be on TV too? Like big bro?\\" I quickly gave Minguk a look to say yes. Minguk nodded vigorously with a bright face. I secretly gave him a thumbs up. [Well done, Jeon Minguk.] * * * As soon as kindergarten was over, I held mom's hand and headed to the audition venue with Minguk. We received a call that Director Kwak's new detergent commercial needed a child actor. The audition venue was Director Kwak's advertising company. Located near Hakdong Station, Director Kwak's advertising company was a renovated detached house with turtles roaming the yard. As I entered holding Minguk's hand, an assistant director who recognized me greeted us warmly. \\"Sungkook, remember me? I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" [Of course, I remember. Jinhee noona, you always complained about Director Kwak's personality behind his back. But you're still working here.] \\"Wow, you're Sungkook's brother. He's really handsome.\\" [That comment, I'll let it slide today. Today's about Minguk's audition.] The assistant director led us to the waiting area. \\"Children from three to five years old are auditioning. Mom, how about Sungkook tries too? You have no idea how much people miss Sungkook in the advertising world.\\" \\"Sungkook is too busy studying these days.\\" \\"That's a shame.\\" Inside the waiting area prepared by the advertising company, there were already about a dozen children. As the assistant director said, they appeared to be between three to five years old. As I entered the waiting room, everyone seemed tense for a moment. Even though I had been away from this industry for a while, everyone remembered me. Then, a child's mother looked at me and grumbled. \\"Is Sungkook auditioning too?\\" \\"No. Sungkook came today because of his brother.\\" The assistant director quickly explained, but the atmosphere in the waiting room remained cold. \\"I hope there's no special treatment just because he's someone's brother.\\" The grumbling woman's voice sounded familiar. [Where have I heard that voice before?] I looked at the woman and the boy sitting next to her. The boy, who seemed to be my age, had round eyes and an unremarkable face. The woman, presumably his mother, was... [Right! Deokpoong Paper!] The boy's name was Lee Jaehui. He was the one who first introduced me to the taste of defeat at my very first audition. Chosen as a commercial model because he was the grandson of Deokpoong Paper, but having grown up sheltered and unaware of the world, he caused countless NGs and was eventually cut from the shoot. Despite lacking talent, he was still lurking around the advertising world. The woman who had just complained about special treatment had tried to make her son a commercial model using Deokpoong Paper's influence, only to be overshadowed. But something about the woman's appearance seemed a bit shabby. The Chanel bag she was holding, which she also had back then, was frayed at the corners, and the tweed jacket and skirt she seemed to have worn before looked worn out. Though they were luxury items, they definitely felt out of fashion. I looked up at mom. Four years ago, mom, carrying me just after my first birthday, took a bus to Samjeon Planning in Itaewon for an audition. Back then, mom was a bit embarrassed by her only black dress for going out. But now, mom was dressed neatly in a jacket and jeans, not luxury brands but clean. She was also carrying a handbag that dad had bought her last year as a birthday gift, a domestic brand. And mom was still beautiful, then and now. I walked up to Lee Jaehui. \\"Hello.\\" When I greeted him with a bright smile, Lee Jaehui, not understanding the situation, smiled back and greeted me. \\"Hello.\\" Lee Jaehui's mom looked at me with displeasure. \\"Sungkook, do you remember me?\\" [Of course, I remember. The daughter-in-law of a medium-sized enterprise.] But it was a time that ordinary children could never remember. I politely greeted her as if I didn't know her. \\"Hello, I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"You know, you became a hit because you replaced my son in that commercial. So, you owe your success to us.\\" [I have a lot to say, but I won't. Daughter-in-law of a medium-sized enterprise.] I kept my mouth shut. \\"Sungkoo, can I have your autograph?\\" Lee Jaehui, who seemed a bit sensitive before, didn't seem as bad as his mother. I signed my name, Jeon Sungkook, clearly on the paper he handed me. \\"Thanks, Sungkoo.\\" \\"Jaehui.\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Always smile in front of the camera.\\" This was my acting tip for Lee Jaehui. After all, it was thanks to him listening to me and hitting Lim Sunmi's surgically altered nose that I was here. Lee Jaehui nodded slightly, as if he somewhat understood. \\"Jaehui, let's fix your hair.\\" Deokpoong Paper's daughter-in-law nervously separated Jaehui and me. I returned to Minguk's side. Several mothers of cheeky children approached me for autographs. Then, a voice called for Lee Jaehui from inside. \\"Jaehui, let's go.\\" Lee Jaehui reluctantly entered the audition room, glancing at me. I squinted my eyes at him. \\"But that woman is always around.\\" A woman receiving my autograph muttered. \\"Do you know her?\\" Mom cautiously asked. She had recognized Deokpoong Paper's daughter-in-law at a glance but pretended not to know. \\"Yeah, she's the former daughter-in-law of Deokpoong Paper. But the chairman of Deokpoong Paper fell for a younger woman and transferred all his wealth to her, leaving nothing for his sons. They all quickly went bankrupt and became destitute. She's trying to make her son a successful entertainer by dragging him around, but from what I see, the son has no talent.\\" \\"I see.\\" Mom's expression turned a bit gloomy, then she held my hand. \\"Sungkook, at your first commercial audition, you competed with the child you greeted. You were just over a year old, so you probably don't remember.\\" [Mom, what are you talking about? I remember everything.] Kim Miyoung also clicked her tongue. \\"Ah, so that was Deokpoong Paper.\\" \\"You knew?\\" \\"That family was infamous. The daughter-in-law paid to push a commercial through Samjeon Planning but was overshadowed by Sungkook. There was a lot of talk at the company.\\" Click. The audition room door opened, and Lee Jaehui came out with his mom. He seemed quite happy. The assistant director waved at us with a smile. \\"It's Minguk's turn.\\" \\"Sister, I'll go with him. Please take care of Sungkook.\\" I held Minguk's hand, looked him in the eye, and said, [Jeon Minguk. You're three years old now. You know what big bro said, right?] Minguk nodded vigorously and replied with energy. \\"Ready!\\""},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break. Don't change space between paragraphs. 제38화 응아까지 하고 시원한 얼굴의 민국이는 나를 보며 연신 히죽거렸다. 나는 민국이 녀석을 뚫어져라 쳐다봤다. “형아.” “밍구가. 이제부터 형아 말 잘 들어.” “응!” 대답은 잘했다. “너도 이제 세 살이나 됐으니 우리 집 사정을 알아야 할 것이야. 알아들어?” 갸웃. 민국이는 고개를 갸웃거렸다. 나는 민국이의 고개를 딱 잡아 고정시켰다. “형, 주목해.” “응!” 이번에도 대답은 잘했다. “밍구가. 우리 엄마, 아빠는 천애 고아야. 그 말은 대한민국에서 살아남기 위해서는 너나 나나 정신 똑바로 차리고 살아야 한다는 거야.” “응!” [저 녀석, 내 말뜻이나 아는 건가.] 아무튼 나는 말을 마저 했다. “형은 돌 막 지나고부터 밥값 했으니, 세 살이면 이제 너도 밥값 벌고도 남을 나이란 말이야. 알았어?” “녜에! 형아. 바갑. 바갑. 밍구기. 해.” “그래, 이제부터 너도 밥값 버는 거야.” “녜에!” 민국이는 두 주먹을 불끈 쥐었다. 그날 밤, 나는 세상 아무것도 모르는 민국이 데뷔를 위한 치밀한 플랜을 짜기 시작했다. 민국이는 얼굴이 좀 딸리니 어린아이다운 표정으로 승부를 봐야 한다. 그렇다면 당장 내일부터 민국이에게 연기 수업을 해야 했다. 대한민국 아역계를 평정한 내가 선생님이라니, 민국이는 정말 행운아였다. “성국아, 안 자고 뭐 해?” 막 씻은 아빠가 방 안을 들여다보고 있었다. [아빠, 노크도 없이 이러면 안 되지. 나도 프라이버시가 있다고.] 나는 얼른 달려가서 배꼽 인사를 했다. “안녕히 주무세요.” “성국아, 9시가 넘었어. 이제 자야지. 아빠가 재워줄까?” [그건 정말 사양할게. 차라리 베개 안고 잘 거야.] 나는 얼른 베개를 안고 침대로 뛰어 올라갔다. 아빠는 그런 나를 보며 흐뭇한 미소를 지으며 방 불을 껐다. “성국아, 잘 자.” 나는 눈을 감고 자는 척을 했지만, 머릿속으로는 민국이의 데뷔를 위한 플랜을 짜고 있었다. * * * 유치원 가방을 내던지자마자 나는 민국이에게로 달려갔다. 민국이를 봐주시는 이모님은 내 간식을 챙기러 부엌에 간 타이밍이었다. 나는 민국이를 끌어다가 TV 앞에 앉혔다. 그리고 TV를 켰다. TV 유치원을 하기 전 광고 시간이었다. 시청자들을 고려해서인지 아역들이 나오는 광고들이 연이어 나왔다. “밍구가, 저거 봐.” “헤헤.” 민국이는 그저 입을 벌린 채 광고를 봤다. “밍구가, 입을 좀 더 벌리고 웃어봐.” “헤에헤에.” 민국이는 생각보다 내 지시를 잘 따랐다. “성국아, 민국이 데리고 뭐 하는 거야?” 이모님이 오는 바람에 내 연기 수업은 시작도 제대로 하기 전에 끝이 났다. “성국아, 우유랑 바나나 먹자.” [오늘은 어쩔 수 없군.] 나는 이모님이 내민 우유와 바나나를 먹으며 민국이에게 아역이 나오는 광고만 집중적으로 보여줬다. [우선은 많이 보는 게 공부가 되는 거야.] 민국이는 넋 나간 얼굴로 TV를 쳐다봤다. “엄마 왔어.” 문이 열리면서 엄마와 김미영이 함께 퇴근했다. 김미영은 이제 우리와 같은 아파트 다른 동에 살았다. 수유의 건물을 정리하고, 잠실의 24평 아파트를 사고 나머지 금액으로는 근처의 작은 상가를 두 채 정도 샀다고 들었다. [역시 김미영의 부동산 감각은 탁월해.] 솔직히 재벌로 살다 보니 부동산을 매매하는 일은 나와 크게 관계가 없었다. 태어났을 때부터 서울 가장 비싼 땅에 집이 몇 채나 됐고, 원한다면 어디든 집을 살 수도 있었다. 서울뿐 아니라 뉴욕과 파리 어느 나라에도 말이다. 종종 공장 부지나 본사 이전 등으로 땅을 매입하는 경우가 있었지만, 그런 것은 어차피 회사에 따로 담당하는 전문가들이 있었다. 아무리 싼 땅도 삼전 그룹의 계열사가 들어서는 순간, 도시가 생기고 땅값이 치솟기도 했다. 부동산 시장을 따라가는 게 아니라, 한마디로 부동산 시장 자체를 만드는 역할을 한 것이다. [김미영과 조만간 심도 깊은 대화 좀 나눠야겠어.] 나는 종종걸음으로 김미영에게 다가가 인사를 했다. “안냥하세요.” “성국아, 안 본 사이에 키가 더 큰 것 같은데. 성국이 엄마, 맞죠?” “네, 언니. 성국이 내복 좀 보세요. 석 달 전에 산 건데 벌써 발목 보여요.” “진짜네. 성국이 키도 엄청 크겠다.” [당연하지.] 아빠가 어림잡아 180센티미터. 엄마도 165센티미터가 넘는 키였다. 이런 유전자라면 내 키도 못 해도 아빠는 넘어설 것 같았다. 내가 저번 생에서 178센티미터였으니, 이번 생에서는 180센티미터를 드디어 넘어볼 수도 있을 것 같았다. [아차, 깜빡했네.] 나는 김미영의 손을 잡고 TV 앞으로 끌고 갔다. TV 앞에는 민국이가 있었다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “밍구기.” 나는 손가락으로 민국이를 가리켰다. “민국이가 왜?” “밍구기가 저거 하루 종일 봐요.” 때마침 아역이 나오는 광고였다. 물론 이 시간에 저 광고가 나온다는 것은 이미 알고 있었다. 김미영은 예리한 눈으로 민국이를 살폈다. 민국이는 내 교육 덕분에 광고 모델을 보면서 표정을 흉내 냈다. 이런 민국이를 어엿한 기획사 대표 김미영이 놓칠 리가 없었다. “민국아, 지금 혹시 저 표정 따라 한 거야?” “녜에!” “민국아, 너도 저렇게 하고 싶어?” 민국이가 슬쩍 내 눈치를 살폈다. 나는 두 눈을 끔뻑했다. 어서 그렇다고 대답하란 신호였다. “녜에!” “언니, 민국이가 뭐라는 거예요?” “성국이 엄마, 민국이가 TV 광고 보면서 흉내 내는데, 제법인데요.” “성국이 하는 거 보고 따라 하는 건가….” “성국이 엄마, 안 그래도 다음 주에 곽 감독님이랑 점심 먹기로 했거든요. 선미 씨 광고 때문에요. 제가 한번 민국이가 응시해볼 만한 광고 알아볼까요?” “민국이를요….” 엄마는 걱정이 앞서는 모양이었다. 나는 얼른 엄마에게 달려가서 다리에 매달렸다. [엄마, 민국이도 이제 지 밥값을 벌어야지. 언제까지 집에서 저렇게 놀릴 거야? 우리처럼 가난한 처지에.] “성국아, 잠깐만.” 엄마는 나를 안아 들고는 민국이에게로 갔다. “민국아, 엄마 좀 봐.” “엄. 마!” 민국이는 헤벌쭉 웃으며 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “민국아, 너도 TV 나오고 싶어. 형아처럼?” 나는 얼른 그러라는 눈빛을 민국이에게 보냈다. 민국이는 해맑은 얼굴로 크게 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 몰래 엄지손가락을 치켜세웠다. [전민국, 잘했어.] * * * 유치원이 끝나자마자 나는 엄마 손을 잡고 민국이와 함께 오디션장으로 향했다. 곽 감독이 새로 찍는 세제 광고에 나올 아역이 필요하단 연락이 왔기 때문이다. 오디션장은 곽 감독의 광고 회사였다. 학동역 부근에 위치한 곽 감독의 광고 회사는 단독 주택을 개조한 곳으로 마당에는 거북이가 돌아다니고 있었다. 내가 민국이의 손을 잡고 들어서자 나를 알아본 조연출 한 명이 반갑게 인사를 했다. “성국아, 나 기억나? 진희 누나야.” [기억나지, 당연히. 진희 누나, 맨날 뒤에서 곽 감독 성격 이상하다고 투덜거렸잖아. 근데 아직도 잘 다니네.] “와, 네가 성국이 동생이구나. 동생도 정말 잘생겼네요.” [그 말은 오늘만 용서해줄게. 오늘은 민국이 오디션이니까.] 조연출은 우리를 대기장으로 안내했다. “세 살에서 다섯 살까지 오디션 보거든요. 어머니, 성국이도 보는 거 어때요? 성국이가 광고계를 떠나서 사람들이 얼마나 아쉬워하는지 몰라요.” “성국이는 요즘 공부하느라 정신이 없어요.” “아쉽네요.” 광고 회사 안쪽에 마련된 대기 장소에는 이미 열댓 명의 아이들이 있었다. 조연출의 말대로 세 살부터 다섯 살 정도로 보이는 아이들이었다. 내가 대기실에 들어서자 순간 모두 긴장한 기색이 역력했다. 아무리 내가 이 업계를 떠난 지 좀 됐지만, 모두들 나를 기억하고 있었다. 이때, 한 아이의 엄마가 나를 보더니 투덜거렸다. “성국이도 오디션 보는 거예요?” “아니에요. 성국이는 오늘 동생 때문에 같이 온 거예요.” 조연출이 얼른 설명을 했지만, 대기실의 분위기는 여전히 차가웠다. “누구 동생이라고 특혜 더 주고 그런 거 아니죠?” 떽떽거리는 여자의 목소리가 익숙했다. [어디서 들어본 목소리인데.] 나는 여자와 여자의 곁에 앉은 남자아이를 쳐다봤다. 내 또래로 보이는 남자아이는 동그란 눈에 별 특색 없는 얼굴이었다. 그리고 그 아이의 엄마로 보이는 여자는. [맞다! 덕풍 제지!] 남자아이의 이름은 이재희. 내 인생 첫 오디션에서 처음으로 좌절을 보게 해준 녀석이었다. 덕풍 제지 손자라는 이유로 광고 모델로 발탁됐지만, 곱게 자라서 세상 물정 모르던 녀석은 수없이 NG를 낸 바람에 촬영 중에 잘리고 말았다. 재능도 없으면서 아직도 광고계를 어슬렁거리고 있는 모양이었다. 방금 전 특혜니 뭐니 따진 여자는 아들에게 추억을 만들어준단 이유로 덕풍 제지 백으로 모두를 들러리 세우고 광고 모델로 만든 덕풍 제지의 며느리였다. 그런데 어딘가 여자의 행색이 조금 초라해 보였다. 그때도 들고 있던 샤랭의 가방은 모서리가 해졌고, 분명 그때도 입고 있었던 것 같은 트위드 재질의 재킷과 스커트도 낡아 보였다. 명품이지만 유행 지난 느낌이 확실히 있었다. 나는 엄마를 올려다봤다. 4년 전 엄마는 돌이 막 지난 나를 안고 버스를 타고 이태원에 있는 삼전 기획에 오디션을 보러 갔었다. 그때 엄마는 유일한 외출복인 검은색 원피스를 조금 창피해했다. 하지만 지금의 엄마는 비록 명품은 아니지만 깔끔한 재킷에 청바지를 매치해서 입었다. 작년에 아빠가 생일 선물이라며 사준 국내 브랜드의 핸드백도 들고 있었다. 그리고 그때나 지금이나 엄마는 여전히 아름다웠다. 나는 저벅저벅 이재희에게 걸어갔다. “안냥.” 내가 먼저 환하게 웃자 이재희는 영문도 모른 채 배시시 웃으며 인사를 받아줬다. “안냥.” 이재희의 엄마는 못마땅한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 나 기억하니?” [물론 기억하지. 중소기업 며느리.] 하지만 보통의 아이들은 결코 기억할 수 없는 시간이었다. 나는 모른 척 정중하게 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “우리 아들 대타로 네가 광고 찍어서 대박 난 거야. 그러니까 네가 광고 찍은 거 다 우리 덕분이야.” [할 말은 많지만, 하지 않겠어. 중소기업 며느리.] 나는 입을 앙다물었다. “성구가. 나 사인 좀.” 이재희는 예전에는 좀 예민해 보였지만, 엄마만큼 성격이 나쁘지는 않은 모양이었다. 나는 이재희가 내민 종이에 전성국 이름을 선명히 적어줬다. “고마워, 성구가.” “재희야.” “응?” “카메라 앞에선 무조건 웃어.” 이건 내가 이재희에게 주는 연기 팁이었다. 어쨌든 이 녀석이 그때 내 말을 듣고 임선미의 성형한 코를 가격해준 덕분에 내가 이 자리에 있는 것이기도 했다. 이재희는 알 듯 모를 듯 한 얼굴로 고개를 살짝 까딱였다. “재희야, 머리 좀 다시 만지자.” 덕풍 제지 며느리는 신경질적으로 재희와 나를 떨어뜨려 났다. 나는 다시 민국이 옆으로 돌아왔다. 벌써 넉살 좋은 몇 명의 아이 엄마들이 다가와서 나에게 사인을 청했다. 이때, 안에서 이재희를 호출하는 목소리가 들렸다. “재희야, 어서 가자.” 이재희는 엄마의 재촉에 못 이겨 오디션장 안으로 들어가면서 나를 흘끔 쳐다봤다. 나는 눈을 찡끗해줬다. “근데 저 여자는 맨날 만나네.” 나에게 사인을 받던 여자가 중얼거렸다. “저분 아세요?” 엄마가 조심스레 물었다. 사실 엄마도 덕풍 제지 며느리를 한눈에 알아봤지만 모른 척하고 있었다. “예전 덕풍 제지 며느리잖아요. 근데 덕풍 제지 회장이 젊은 여자한테 빠져서 재산을 모조리 그 여자한테 넘기는 바람에 저 집 아들들은 건져서 나온 게 없대요. 다들 순식간에 망해서 폐인 되고, 아들 하나 어떻게든 연예인 만들어서 성공시키려고 돌아다니는데. 제가 보기에 아들이 영 재능이 없어요.” “그렇군요.” 엄마의 표정이 조금 시무룩해졌다. 그러더니 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 너 첫 광고 오디션 때 네가 인사한 애랑 같이 경쟁했었어. 돌 막 지난 때라 기억 안 날 거야.” [엄마, 뭔 소리야. 나 다 기억해.] 김미영도 혀를 낮게 찼다. “아, 저 집이 덕풍 제지였군요.” “언니도 알아요?” “저 집 소문 파다했어요. 며느리가 그때 삼전 기획에 돈 주고 광고 하나 밀어 넣었다가 성국이한테 밀렸잖아요. 회사에서도 말 많았어요.” 달칵. 오디션장 문이 열리면서 이재희가 엄마와 나왔다. 꽤 밝은 얼굴이었다. 조연출이 웃으며 손을 흔들었다. “민국이 차례예요.” “언니, 제가 같이 갈게요. 성국이 좀 봐주세요.” 나는 민국이 손을 꼭 잡고 눈을 마주쳤다. [전민국. 너도 이제 세 살이야. 형 말 알지?] 민국이는 다부지게 고개를 끄덕이며 힘차게 대답했다. “바압갑!”","completion":"Episode 38 After soiling himself, Minkyuk, with his refreshed face, kept smirking at me continuously. I stared intensely at Minkyuk. \\"Brother.\\" \\"Minguku. From now on, listen well to your brother.\\" \\"Yes!\\" He answered well. \\"Since you're already three years old, you should know our family's situation. Understand?\\" With a tilt of his head, Minkyuk tilted it in confusion. I grabbed Minkyuk's head firmly to fix his gaze. \\"Bro, pay attention.\\" \\"Yes!\\" He responded well again. \\"Minguku. Our mom and dad are orphans of this world. This means, in order to survive in South Korea, both you and I need to live our lives with our senses fully alert.\\" \\"Yes!\\" [I wonder if this guy even understands what I mean.] Anyway, I continued. \\"Bro started earning his keep right after turning one, so now that you're three, it's time for you to earn more than your keep. Got it?\\" \\"Yes, brother! Happy. Happy. Minguki does.\\" \\"That's right. From now on, you'll be earning your own keep too.\\" \\"Yes!\\" Minkyuk clenched his fists tightly. That night, I started meticulously planning Minkyuk's debut into the world, oblivious to everything. Minkyuk, lacking a bit in looks, had to win people over with childlike expressions. So, starting tomorrow, I had to start teaching him acting. As someone who had dominated the child actor scene in South Korea, I was essentially his teacher, making Minkyuk truly fortunate. \\"Sunguk, what are you doing up so late?\\" Freshly showered, dad peered into my room. [Dad, you can't just enter without knocking. I have my privacy too.] I quickly ran over and greeted him with a bow. \\"Goodnight.\\" \\"Sunguk, it's past 9. You should be sleeping by now. Want dad to put you to bed?\\" [I would really prefer not to. I'd rather hug a pillow to sleep.] I quickly grabbed my pillow and jumped onto the bed. Watching me, dad smiled warmly and turned off the room light. \\"Sunguk, sleep well.\\" Though I closed my eyes pretending to sleep, my mind was busy formulating plans for Minkyuk's debut. * * * As soon as kindergarten ended, I rushed to Minkyuk. Auntie, who took care of Minkyuk, had just gone to the kitchen to prepare snacks for me. I pulled Minkyuk in front of the TV and turned it on. It was advertisement time before kids' programs started. The ads, considering their target audience, mostly featured child actors. \\"Minguku, look.\\" \\"Hehe.\\" Minkyuk simply watched the advertisements with his mouth open. \\"Minguku, try opening your mouth wider and smile.\\" \\"Heeheehee.\\" Minkyuk surprisingly followed my instructions well. \\"Sunguk, what are you doing with Minkyuk?\\" Auntie returned, ending the acting lesson even before it could properly begin. \\"Sunguk, let's have some milk and bananas.\\" [Can't be helped today.] While eating the snacks Auntie had prepared, I made Minkyuk watch advertisements featuring child actors, focusing on them intensively. [Watching a lot first serves as a study too.] With an entranced look, Minkyuk stared at the TV. \\"Mom's back.\\" The door opened, and Mom and Kim Miyoung came home from work together. Kim Miyoung now lived in a different building within our apartment complex. After settling the property in Suyu and buying a 24 Pyeong apartment in Jamsil, she invested the remaining amount in a couple of small shops nearby. [Kim Miyoung's real estate sense is indeed exceptional.] Living as a tycoon, property trading wasn't really my concern. From birth, I had several houses on Seoul's most expensive lands, and if desired, could buy a house anywhere, not just in Seoul but in New York or Paris too. Although the company occasionally acquired land for factories or office relocations, there were specialists in the company dedicated to those tasks. Regardless of how cheap the land was, the moment a Samsung Group affiliate moved in, a city sprang up, and the land's value soared. We weren't just following the real estate market; we were, in a way, creating it. [I should have a deep conversation with Kim Miyoung soon.] I hurriedly approached Kim Miyoung to greet her. \\"Hello.\\" \\"Sunguk, you seem to have grown even taller. You're Sunguk's mom, right?\\" \\"Yes, sister. Look at Sunguk's thermal underwear. Bought it three months ago, and it's already showing his ankles.\\" \\"Really. Sunguk's growing so fast.\\" [Of course.] Dad was roughly 180 centimeters tall, and mom was over 165 centimeters. With such genes, I expected to surpass dad's height easily. In my past life, I was 178 centimeters tall, so in this life, I might finally surpass 180 centimeters. [Oops, almost forgot.] I took Kim Miyoung's hand and dragged her in front of the TV. Minkyuk was sitting there. \\"Sunguk, what's up?\\" \\"Minguki.\\" I pointed to Minkyuk. \\"What about Minkyuk?\\" \\"Minguki watches this all day.\\" Coincidentally, a child actor appeared on the advertisement. Of course, I had known this advertisement would be airing now. Kim Miyoung observed Minkyuk with keen eyes. Thanks to my training, Minkyuk mimicked the expressions of the ad's models. Kim Miyoung, the ambitious agency head, couldn't overlook Minkyuk's talent. \\"Minkyuk, did you just imitate that expression?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Minkyuk, do you want to do that too?\\" Minkyuk glanced at me. I blinked emphatically, signaling him to affirm. \\"Yes!\\" \\"Sunguk's mom, what's Minkyuk saying?\\" \\"Sunguk's mom, Minkyuk imitated the expressions from TV ads perfectly.\\" \\"Is Sunguk showing him what to do...\\" \\"Sunguk's mom, I'm meeting director Kwak for lunch next week because of Sunmi's ad. Shall I see if there's a suitable ad for Minkyuk to audition for?\\" \\"Minkyuk for an ad...\\" Mom seemed worried. I quickly ran to mom and clung to her leg. [Mom, Minkyuk has to start earning his keep too. How long will he just play around at home? Considering our financial situation.] \\"Sunguk, wait.\\" Mom picked me up and went to Minkyuk. \\"Minkyuk, look at mom.\\" \\"Mom!\\" Minkyuk looked at mom with a wide, toothy grin. \\"Minkyuk, do you want to be on TV, like your brother?\\" I eagerly prompted Minkyuk with my gaze. With a bright face, Minkyuk nodded energetically. I secretly raised my thumb. [Well done, Jeon Minkyuk.] * * * Right after kindergarten, mom, Minkyuk, and I headed to the audition site. It was because director Kwak's company needed a child actor for a new detergent ad. The audition site, located near Hakdong Station, was director Kwak's advertising company, housed in a renovated standalone home with a turtle wandering in the yard. As I entered holding Minkyuk's hand, an assistant director who recognized me greeted us warmly. \\"Sunguk, remember me? I'm Jinee.\\" [Of course, I remember. Jinee always grumbled about Kwak's director being weird behind his back. And you're still working well with him.] \\"Wow, you're Sunguk's younger brother? You're really handsome too.\\" [You get a pass for today because it's Minkyuk's audition.] The assistant director led us to a waiting area. \\"We're auditioning kids from three to five years old. How about Sunguk auditioning too? You wouldn't believe how much people miss Sunguk in the ad world.\\" \\"Sunguk's been too busy studying recently.\\" \\"That's a shame.\\" Inside the waiting area, already filled with about a dozen children, looked to be around three to five years old, as per the assistant director's words. As I entered the room, everyone tensed up, not being able to forget me despite my absence from the industry. Then, a child's mom spotted me and grumbled. \\"Sunguk's auditioning too?\\" \\"No. He's here today for his brother.\\" The assistant director quickly cleared the misunderstanding, but the atmosphere remained chilly. \\"There won't be any special treatment because he's someone's brother, right?\\" The grumbling voice sounded familiar. [I've heard this voice before.] Turning to the voice, I saw a woman and a boy seated beside her. The boy, about my age, had round eyes but an unremarkable face. And the woman, presumably his mother, was... [Right! Deokpoong Paper Company!] The boy's name was Lee Jaehee. He was the one who made me face my first ever failure at an audition due to being chosen for a commercial simply because he was the grandson of Deokpoong Paper Company. Despite having no talent and causing countless NGs, resulting in his removal during the shoot, he was still lurking around the advertising world. The woman, who had previously managed to push everyone aside using Deokpoong Paper Company's backing to get her son into a commercial, turned out to be Deokpoong's daughter-in-law. However, something about her appearance seemed a bit shabby now. The Chanel bag she had, now worn at the corners, and the tweed jacket and skirt, seemingly from before, looked aged despite their brand's reputation. Although they were genuine luxury items, they clearly felt outdated. I looked up at mom. Four years ago, mom, with me barely a year old, had taken the bus to Samjeon Planning in Itaewon for an audition, feeling slightly embarrassed about her only dress for going out, which was black. But now, mom, though not in luxury brands, was dressed neatly in a casual jacket and jeans. She also carried a handbag dad had gifted her last year as a birthday present from a local brand. And mom was still as beautiful as ever, then and now. I walked up to Jaehee. \\"Hello.\\" Greeting him first with a bright smile, Jaehee returned the greeting confusedly but still smiled back warmly. \\"Hello.\\" Jaehee's mom looked at me disapprovingly. \\"Sunguk, do you remember me?\\" [Of course, I remember. The daughter-in-law of a medium-sized company.] But it was a moment too far back for ordinary children to recall. I politely introduced myself, pretending not to remember. \\"Hello. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"It's because you replaced my son in the ad and hit it big. So, technically, it's all thanks to us that you succeeded in that commercial.\\" [I have a lot to say but will refrain. Daughter-in-law of a medium-sized company.] I kept my mouth shut tightly. \\"Sunguga. Can I get an autograph?\\" Jaehee, who had seemed a bit sensitive back then, didn't have his mom's bad temperament it seemed. I signed my name clearly on the paper Jaehee offered. \\"Thank you, Sunguga.\\" \\"Jaehee.\\" \\"Huh?\\" \\"Always smile in front of the camera.\\" This was an acting tip I was giving to Jaehee. After all, thanks to him hitting Lim Seonmi's surgically altered nose back then, I got this opportunity. Jaehee seemed to half understand and nodded slightly. \\"Jaehee, let's fix your hair.\\" Jaehee's mom, annoyed, pulled him and me apart. I returned next to Minkyuk. Soon, a few motherly fans approached me for autographs. Then, a voice called Jaehee into the audition room. \\"Jaehee, let's go.\\" Following his mother's urging, Jaehee entered the audition room, glancing back at me. I squinted my eyes at him. \\"But I always see that woman.\\" A woman getting my signature murmured. \\"Do you know her?\\" Mom asked cautiously. She had recognized Jaehee's mom at a glance but pretended not to know. \\"Yeah, she's the former daughter-in-law of Deokpoong Paper Company. But after the chairman fell for a young woman and gave her all his wealth, Jaehee's family practically got nothing. They all went bankrupt overnight, and now she's trying to make her son a successful entertainer. But from what I see, her son has no talent.\\" \\"I see.\\" Mom looked a bit disappointed, then held my hand. \\"Sunguk, at your first ad audition, you competed with the boy you just greeted. You were barely a year old then, so you might not remember.\\" [What are you talking about, mom? I remember everything.] Kim Miyoung also clucked her tongue. \\"Ah, so they were Deokpoong Paper's family.\\" \\"Sister, you knew?\\" \\"Yeah, that house's story was quite notorious. The daughter-in-law had once shoved a lot of money into Samjeon Planning just to get shoved aside by Sunguk. There was a lot of talk within the company.\\" Click. The door opened, and Jaehee emerged with his mom, looking fairly cheerful. The assistant director waved us over. \\"It's Minkyuk's turn.\\" \\"Sister, I'll go with him. Could you look after Sunguk?\\" I locked eyes with Minkyuk. [Jeon Minkyuk. You're already three. Remember what your brother said?] Determinedly, Minkyuk nodded and boldly replied. \\"Yes!\\""},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[정말 비범하게 태어난 것도 골치 아픈 일이구나.] 나는 심드렁한 얼굴로 짜장면을 먹었다. 오늘 저녁은 특별히 나를 위한 짜장면이었다. 아빠가 짧게 지금의 상황에 대해서 설명을 했다. “양 비서님께서는 성국이는 미국 유학 보내는 게 어떻겠냐고 그러시더라고요. 이번에 회장님 자녀들이 모두 미국 가는데, 거기 함께요. 아무래도 성국이 같은 영재를 국내에서는 교육시키기 어려울 것 같다고 하시면서요.” 김미영은 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 흘금 김미영의 짜장면을 쳐다봤다. [김 매니저, 안 먹을 거면 내가 좀 더 먹어도 될까?] 요즘 키가 크느라 배 속이 계속 헛헛했다. 김미영은 내가 짜장면을 훔쳐보자, 빙긋 미소를 지으며 자신의 짜장을 덜어줬다. “성국아, 많이 먹어.” “네에, 감사합니다.” 나는 바르게 인사를 하고는 짜장면을 호로록 흡입했다. “부모님들 생각은 어떠세요?” 김미영이 엄마와 아빠를 조심스레 쳐다봤다. “저희야 아이랑 같이 있고 싶은 마음이 더 크긴 한데요. 언니, 그래도 성국이 미래를 위해서면 미국으로 가야 하지 않을까요? 이런 천재를 저희가 키우다가 평범해지면 어떻게 해요.” [엄마, 나 천재 아니야. 아이큐 겨우 121이라고. 에휴.] “성국이 아버지는 어떠세요?” “소영이는 아무래도 엄마니까 교육 문제에 좀 더 예민해요. 근데, 어제 글쎄, 성국이가 안 싸던 오줌을 쌌더라고요.” “아빠!” 나는 버럭 소리를 질렀다. 아빠가 웃으면서 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국이 창피하구나.” [하아, 이건 비밀이라고!] 김미영과 엄마의 웃음소리가 들렸다. 나는 고개를 저었다. [어른들이란….] 정말 종종 어른들은 어린아이가 얼마나 예민한지 잊을 때가 있었다. 나는 그냥 짜장면에 집중하기로 했다. 그리고 유학에 대한 나의 생각은 이미 정해져 있었다. “자기야, 성국이 창피해하잖아. 그만해.” “알았어, 알았어. 실수 같은 거 잘 안 하는 성국이가 실수하니까, 성국이도 아직 애기지. 그런 생각도 들고, 난 좋더라고.” [애기 아니거든.] 나는 짜장면을 후루룩 먹곤 입을 앙다물었다. “그럼, 성국이 아버지는 성국이 유학 반대 입장이신 거네요?” “지금은 좀 이르지 않나 싶어요. 겨우 다섯 살이잖아요. 입는 거, 씻는 거 다 돌봐줘야 하는 나이라고요. 아무리 삼전 그룹에서 보조해 주신다고 해도 부모만 못하잖아요.” [아빠, 내가 말을 안 했나 본데. 저번 생에서는 다섯 살 때부터 외국 수없이 왔다 갔다 했어. 엄마, 아빠는 당연히 없었고. 의전팀이 있긴 했네.] “성국이 아빠는 그런데, 나는 이 기회 놓치기가 아깝고 그래요, 언니.” “두 사람 마음 다 이해되네.” 나는 호로록 짜장면을 먹었다. 김미영이 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너는 어때?” [흠….] 나는 이성을 다잡고 저번 생의 전성국이었다면 어떤 결정을 했을까에 대해서 고민했다. 이미 저번 생에서 다 경험한 유학이라 선뜻 내키지 않는 게 속마음이었다. 그리고 나는 그들이 생각하는 만큼의 천재도 아니었다. 저번 생의 경험치가 누적되어 무척 뛰어난 아이일 뿐이었다. 미국의 영재교육 시스템 아래에서 아마 그들은 내가 노벨상 하나쯤 탈 인재로 성장하기를 바랄지도 모르지만, 나는 그 정도는 아니었다. 이건 냉철한 판단이었다. 그렇다면 안락한 엄마, 아빠 품에서 유년기를 보내는 게 맞지 않을까? 짜장면이나 실컷 먹으면서. 뭐, 이런 여러 가지 생각이 들었다. “어, 민국아! 민국아, 왜 그래?” 이야기를 나누는 동안 민국이가 사라졌다. 엄마가 얼른 안방으로 들어가는 게 보였다. [민국이 녀석, 또 무슨 사고를 친 거야?] 이때, 안방에서 민국이의 처절한 울음소리가 들렸다. “으아앙- 형아- 형아-.” [왜 나를 찾고 그러는 거야. 귀찮게.] “민국아, 왜 그래?” “형아. 형아.” 엄마가 달래도 민국이는 울 뿐이었다. [내가 나서야 하는 건가.] 나는 짜장면 먹던 포크를 놓고 안방으로 걸어갔다. 민국이가 울면서 내 옷이 든 옷장 서랍을 헤집고 있었다. 엄마가 민국이를 말렸다. “민국아, 왜 그래. 그거 형아 옷이야.” “으아아앙-.” [참 시끄럽게 우네.] 민국이는 옷장에서 연신 내 옷을 빼다가 이불 아래에 숨기고 있었다. [민국아, 네가 숨기는 거 다 보여.] 엄마는 민국이를 제지했지만, 민국이는 엄마마저 밀어버리고 옷을 계속 숨겼다. 나는 얼른 민국이한테 다가갔다. [너, 손님도 와 있는데 떼쓰면 형아가 혼낸다.] 민국이의 얼굴은 이미 눈물, 콧물 범벅이었다. “형아.” [형아 왜 찾아?] 민국이는 갑자기 눈물, 콧물 범벅이 된 손으로 나를 꽉 안았다. [이 녀석이 언제 이렇게 힘이 세졌지?] “놔아, 민국아.” 내가 몸을 틀수록 민국이는 나를 더 세게 안았다. “형아. 가디 마.” “어?” “형아. 가디 마.” [너 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 형, 미국 유학 가지 말라고?] “형아. 밍구기랑 여기 사라. 가디 마.” 나는 순간 몸이 굳었다. 이 녀석이 내 옷을 숨긴 것은 내가 떠날까 싶어서였다. 민국이는 나를 꽉 안고는 놓아주지 않았다. 하도 울어도 쉰 목소리로 계속해서 중얼거렸다. “형아. 가디 마. 밍구기랑 여기 사라. 가디 마.” 울컥. 눈시울이 뜨거워졌다. [왜 또 감동시키는 건데!] 저번 생에서 짧은 연수나 유학을 갈 때에도 동생들은 울지도 말리지도 않았다. 경쟁자가 눈앞에서 사라지는 것만으로도 안도하는 눈치들이었다. “크응-.” 민국이는 코를 쭉 들이켰다. [더럽게.] 나는 한 손으로 휴지를 집으려고 했지만, 민국이 때문에 손이 닿지 않았다. “밍구가, 이거 놔.” “시로, 형아. 어디도 못 가.” [정말 이 녀석.] 나는 어쩔 수 없이 대답했다. “밍구가, 형아 안 가. 아무 데도 안 가.” “진따?” 밍구기는 눈물을 뚝 그치고 초롱초롱한 눈으로 나를 올려다봤다. “형아, 진따야?” “응. 형아 안 가.” 나는 단호하게 말했다. * * * 삼성동의 전재형 회장의 집은 한남동의 집과는 사뭇 다른 분위기였다. 한남동이 철의 여왕의 취향에 맞춰서 프렌치 스타일의 인테리어를 추구했다면, 이곳은 전재형 회장의 취향이 그대로 묻어났다. 모던한 가구들과 전재형 회장이 선호하는 잭슨 폴의 작품들이 곳곳에 보였다. 잭슨 폴의 그림은 이제 세계 어느 곳에서도 구하기 힘들었다. 전재형 회장은 막 위스키를 따르던 참이었다. 양 비서가 들어오는 소리가 들렸다. 한남동 자택에서와 똑같은 것은 양 비서밖에 없었다. 양 비서 역시 전재형 회장을 따라서 인근으로 이사를 온 터였다. “회장님 취향이 그대로 묻어나는 인테리어네요.” “한남동 집은 너무 안락해서 영 내 취향이 아니었어.” “잭슨 폴 작품을 이번에 많이 구매하셨는데, 꽤 마음에 드시나 봐요?” “난 고전보다는 모던한 게 취향이거든.” 전재형 회장은 위스키를 한 잔 더 따라 양 비서에게 내밀었다. “이사하느라 양 비서도 수고했어.” “제 일인걸요.” 양 비서는 잔을 받으며 낮게 고개를 숙였다. 사실 오늘은 보고할 일이 있었다. “태국 군과 미진 양 유학은 잘 진행 중입니다. 사모님께서도 초기에는 같이 가셔서 적응할 때까지 같이 계실 것 같습니다.” “당연한 일이지. 태국이 사고 안 치게 주의 좀 기울이게.” “걱정 마십시오. 동기 중에 태국이 친구들도 몇 명 심어뒀고, 모두 저희에게 보고할 것입니다.” 전재형 회장은 고개를 끄덕였다. 자신의 유학 시절에도 그랬다. 돌아가신 아버지 전주신 전 회장 역시 전재형 회장이 유학하는 곳곳마다 친구라는 이름으로 몇 명을 심어두고 보고를 받았다. 지금 전재형 회장이 궁금한 건 따로 있었다. “그리고 성국 군은….” 전재형 회장의 오른쪽 눈썹이 올라갔다. 아이들의 이야기를 들을 때보다 더 신경 쓰이는 눈치였다. “성국 군은 이번에 같이 안 가기로 결정했습니다.” “의외인데….” 전재형 회장의 생각으로는 도저히 납득이 안 됐다. 이 좋은 기회를 날려 버리다니. “혹 성국이 부모들이 말린 건가. 평범한 사람들은 항상 그렇잖아. 가족이 더 중요하고, 아이를 끼고 자신들이 돌보아야 한다고 말이야.” “물론 성국이 부모님의 입장은 그런 부분이 있었습니다. 하지만 성국이 어머니 같은 경우에는 유학을 꽤 진지하게 고민하셨던 것 같습니다. 아무래도 더 좋은 환경에서 교육시키고 싶은 욕심이 있으셨거든요.” “그런데?” “성국이가 결정한 일이라고 합니다.” “겨우 다섯 살한테 결정을 맡겼다는 말인가?” “가족회의를 했다고 합니다.” “흠….” 전재형 회장은 위스키를 단숨에 들이켰다. 정말 납득 불가능한 일이었다. 인생의 단계를 점프할 수 있는 이런 소중한 기회를 날려 버리다니. “성국이가 뛰어난 아이이긴 하지만 아직 다섯 살이라 부모들의 손이 많이 갈 나이 아니겠습니까. 성국이 정도면 앞으로도 충분히 지켜보다 유학을 보내도 될 것 같습니다.” “그렇긴 하겠지. 다섯 살. 어리긴 하지.” 전재형 회장은 아쉬움을 삼켰다. 삼전 그룹을 이끌 차세대 인재라면 당연히 앞으로는 그 기회를 놓치지 않을 것이라고 믿었다. * * * 유학 이야기가 오간 이후로 민국이는 내 곁에서 떨어지지 않았다. 밥을 먹을 때도. 옷을 갈아입을 때도. 심지어 화장실을 갈 때도 껌딱지처럼 붙어 다녔다. “형아. 응아해?” “보면 몰라?” 내 인내심도 점점 바닥이 나고 있었다. 끄응. 나는 마지막 힘을 주고는 얼른 변기의 물을 내렸다. “형아, 밍구기도.” “너도 응아 마렵다고?” “응.” 나는 밍구기를 끌고 유아용 변기에 앉혔다. “힘줘.” “으응. 형아.” 민국이는 힘을 주면서도 내 손을 꼭 쥔 채였다. [경쟁자 녀석이 이젠 껌딱지가 되다니.] 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. 그래도 다행인 것은 이 녀석 덕분에 이성적으로 판단을 다시 할 수 있었다는 것이다. 내가 겨우 민국이가 날 붙잡고 오열해서 유학을 포기한 것으로 여긴다면 큰 오산이다. 민국이와 손을 잡고 잔 그날, 나는 내가 한 가지 사실을 간과했다는 것을 깨달았다. 그건 바로 삼전 그룹이었다. 만약 지금부터 삼전 그룹의 후원까지 받아 유학까지 간다면 나는 이번 생에서도 삼전 그룹의 그늘에서 벗어나기 어려웠다. 그건 내가 원한 삶이 아니었다. 내가 원한 진짜 삶은 이번 생에서 나 스스로 대한민국 최고가 되는 일이다. “형아, 응아 끄읕.” 민국이가 나를 향해 엉덩이를 내밀었다. [지금 뒤도 닦아달란 거냐?] “형아.” “하아….” 단전에서부터 깊은 한숨이 흘러나왔다. [나 정말 유학 포기한 거 잘한 거지?] 나는 한 손으로 코를 잡고, 휴지를 집어 들었다.","completion":"Episode 37 A family meeting was convened. Now, even Kim Mi-young, who was like family, was present. Min-guk also took a spot. The reason everyone gathered was all because of me. Specifically, my study abroad issue. [Being born so exceptional is truly a headache.] I ate black bean noodles with a lackluster face. Tonight’s dinner was black bean noodles specially for me. Dad briefly explained the current situation. “Secretary Yang suggested that perhaps it would be good to send Seong-guk to study in the US. This time, all the chairman's children are going there together. Apparently, it seems difficult to educate a genius like Seong-guk domestically.” Kim Mi-young nodded. I secretly glanced at Kim Mi-young’s black bean noodles. [Manager Kim, if you’re not going to eat, can I have some more?] I had been constantly hungry lately due to a growth spurt. When Kim Mi-young saw me eyeing her noodles, she smiled and gave me some of hers. “Seong-guk, eat a lot.” “Yes, thank you.” I properly greeted her and slurped the noodles. “What do the parents think?” Kim Mi-young cautiously looked at mom and dad. “Well, we certainly prefer to be with our child. But, shouldn’t Seong-guk go to the US for his future? What if we raise such a genius only for him to turn ordinary.” [Mom, I’m not a genius. My IQ is just 121. Sigh.] “What about Seong-guk’s father?” “Soyoung is especially sensitive about education since she is the mother. But, yesterday, Seong-guk unexpectedly wet the bed.” “Dad!” I shouted out loud. Dad laughed and patted my head. “Seong-guk’s embarrassed.” [Haah, that was supposed to be a secret!] I heard Kim Mi-young and mom laugh. I shook my head. [Adults…] Really, adults sometimes forget how sensitive a child can be. I decided to focus on the black bean noodles. And my thoughts about going abroad were already decided. “Honey, Seong-guk is feeling embarrassed. Let’s stop.” “Alright, alright. It’s rare for Seong-guk to make such a mistake, he’s still a child. That thought crossed my mind, and I liked it.” [I'm not a baby.] I slurped the noodles and clenched my mouth shut. “So, Seong-guk’s father opposes the study abroad?” “It seems a bit early now. He’s only five years old. He still needs care for dressing and washing. No matter how much support the Samjeon Group provides, it’s not the same as parents.” [Dad, haven’t I told you? In my previous life, I traveled abroad countless times since I was five. Of course, without mom and dad. There was a protocol team, though.] “Seong-guk’s dad however, I feel reluctant to miss this opportunity, sister.” “I understand both sides.” I slurped the noodles. Kim Mi-young looked at me. “Seong-guk, what do you think?” [Hmm….] I sobered up and pondered what the previous Seong-guk would have decided. Having already experienced studying abroad in a previous life, I was not very inclined. And I was not the genius they thought I was. The accumulated experience of my previous life made me exceptionally smart. Under the US genius education system, they might expect me to grow into a Nobel Prize-worthy talent, but I was not. It was a rational judgment. Would it be better to spend my childhood in the comfortable embrace of mom and dad, stuffing myself with black bean noodles? Well, that’s what I thought. “Oh, Min-guk! Min-guk, what’s wrong?” While we were talking, Min-guk disappeared. Mom quickly went into the bedroom. [What kind of trouble has Min-guk gotten into now?] Then, Min-guk’s desperate cries came from the bedroom. “Waaah- Brother- Brother-.” [Why is he looking for me like this. So bothersome.] “Min-guk, what’s wrong?” “Brother. Brother.” Despite mom’s consoling, Min-guk only cried. [Do I need to step in?] I laid down my fork and walked into the bedroom. Min-guk was sobbing and rummaging through the drawer containing my clothes. Mom tried to stop Min-guk. “Min-guk, what are you doing. That’s your brother’s clothes.” “Waaah-.” [So noisy.] Min-guk kept pulling out my clothes and hiding them under the blanket. [Min-guk, I can see you hiding them.] Mom restrained him, but Min-guk pushed her away and continued hiding the clothes. I quickly approached Min-guk. [You're throwing a tantrum with guests over, brother will scold you.] Min-guk’s face was already a mess of tears and snot. “Brother.” [Why are you looking for brother?] Suddenly, Min-guk with his tear-and-snot stained hands hugged me tightly. [When did he get so strong?] “Let go, Min-guk.” The more I struggled, the tighter Min-guk hugged me. “Brother. Don’t go.” “Huh?” “Brother. Don’t go.” [Are you saying, brother, don't go study abroad?] “Brother. Stay here with Min-gukki. Don’t go.” I was momentarily frozen. Min-guk was hiding my clothes because he feared I would leave. Min-guk held me tight without letting go, his voice hoarse from crying, he continued to mutter. “Brother. Don’t go. Stay here with Min-gukki. Don’t go.” Tears welled up in my eyes. [Why are you making me emotional.] In my previous life, when I went on short study programs or study abroad, my siblings neither cried nor stopped me. They seemed relieved as if a competitor had vanished from their sight. “Ughh-.” Min-guk sniffled loudly. [Gross.] As I reached for a tissue with one hand, unable to because of Min-guk, I sighed deeply. [Did I really make the right decision not going abroad?] “Min-gukki, let go.” “No, brother. Can’t go anywhere.” [Really this kid.] I had no choice but to respond. “Min-gukki, brother won’t go. Not anywhere.” “Really?” Min-guk stopped crying and looked up at me with sparkling eyes. “Brother, really?” “Yes. Brother won’t go.” I spoke decisively. * * * The atmosphere of Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung’s house in Samseong-dong was distinctly different from the house in Hannam-dong. If Hannam-dong followed the Iron Queen’s preference for French-style interior, this place thoroughly reflected Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung’s taste. Modern furniture and works of Jackson Pollock, favored by Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, were visible everywhere. Jackson Pollock's paintings were now hard to find anywhere in the world. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was just pouring whiskey. Secretary Yang entered the sound. The only similarity with the Hannam-dong residence was Secretary Yang. Following Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, Secretary Yang also moved nearby. “The interior truly reflects Chairman’s taste.” “The Hannam-dong house was too comfortable, not quite my style.” “You’ve bought many Jackson Pollock works recently, they must really please you?” “I prefer modern over classical.” Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung poured another glass of whiskey and offered it to Secretary Yang. “You’ve worked hard with the move, Secretary Yang.” “It’s my job.” Secretary Yang took the glass and bowed slightly. In fact, there was something to report today. “The Thai military and Mi-jin's studies are proceeding well. The madam plans to go together initially to help them settle.” “Make sure Tae-guk doesn’t cause any trouble.” “Don’t worry. I’ve placed a few of Tae-guk’s friends among the students, all will report to us.” Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung nodded. His own study abroad was similar. The late Chairman Jeon Ju-shin also had friends stationed everywhere Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung studied to report back. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was curious about something else. “And Seong-guk…” Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung’s right eyebrow raised. He seemed more concerned than when talking about his children. “Seong-guk decided not to go this time.” “Unexpected….” Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung couldn’t understand. To throw away such a precious opportunity. “Did Seong-guk’s parents oppose it? Normal people always do. They prioritize family, insisting they must care for their child.” “There was some of that from Seong-guk’s parents. But Seong-guk’s mother seriously considered the study abroad. She yearns to provide a better education in a better environment.” “And?” “Seong-guk made the decision.” “Leaving the decision to a five-year-old?” “They had a family meeting.” “Hmm…” Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung downed his whiskey in one gulp. It was incomprehensible. To miss out on an opportunity to leap forward in life. “At Seong-guk’s age, he needs a lot of parental care. Considering Seong-guk’s potential, waiting a bit longer for studying abroad seems reasonable.” “That’s true. Five years old. He is young.” Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung swallowed his disappointment. If Seong-guk was to lead Samjeon Group’s next generation, he surely believed he wouldn’t miss future opportunities. * * * After the discussion about studying abroad, Min-guk wouldn’t leave my side. Whether eating meals, changing clothes, or even going to the bathroom, he stuck to me like glue. “Brother. Poo-poo?” “Can’t you see?” My patience was running thin. Groan. I exerted myself and quickly flushed the toilet. “Brother, Min-gukki too.” “You need to poo too?” “Yeah.” I took Min-guk to the child’s toilet and made him sit. “Push.” “Eung. Brother.” Min-guk exerted himself while firmly holding my hand. [My rival has become a sticky note.] I shook my head. However, the upside was that this situation helped me rethink rationally. If I thought I gave up studying abroad just because Min-guk held on to me and cried, that would be a big misunderstanding. The night Min-guk held my hand, I realized I had overlooked one critical fact. It was about Samjeon Group. If I accepted Samjeon Group’s support and went abroad for studies, I would have difficulty escaping their shadow in this life. That wasn’t the life I wanted. The real life I wanted in this rebirth was to become South Korea’s best on my own. “Brother, poo-poo done.” Min-guk turned towards me with his butt out. [Are you asking me to wipe for you now?] “Brother.” “Sigh…” A deep sigh came from my diaphragm. [Did I really make the right decision by not going abroad?] I grabbed a tissue with one hand while holding my nose with the other."},{"prompt":"(In the town of Axel...)

Let's break down the phrase \\"faire face au monde\\" for a detailed word-by-word or phrase-based analysis, focusing on its construction in French and the nuances each component contributes to the overall meaning. # Faire - **Translation:** \\"to do\\" or \\"to make\\" - **Analysis:** In this context, \\"faire\\" is a versatile verb that's foundational in French. Its usage here, however, leans more towards \\"to make\\" or \\"to cause to happen.\\" When used in idiomatic expressions, \\"faire\\" often implies an action taken by the subject, in this case, to \\"face.\\" It sets the stage for a proactive or reactive measure. The choice of \\"faire\\" imbues the phrase with a sense of action or effort on the part of the subject, suggesting that facing the world is not a passive experience but requires deliberate action or effort. # Face - **Translation:** \\"face\\" - **Analysis:** Used in this phrase, \\"face\\" isn’t referring to the physical part of the body but is a metaphorical usage meaning \\"to confront\\" or \\"to stand before\\" something. It implies a direct engagement, with nothing standing between the subject and the object (the world). The positioning evokes a sense of immediacy and confrontation, emphasizing an active rather than avoidant stance. # Au - **Translation:** \\"to the\\" (contracted form of \\"à le\\") - **Analysis:** \\"Au\\" is a contraction of \\"à\\" (to) and \\"le\\" (the), used before masculine singular nouns. It suggests directionality and specificity. The usage of \\"au\\" instead of \\"à\\" adds a definite article to \\"world,\\" not referring to any world but specifically \\"the\\" world, implying a particular known entity or the entirety of what the subject faces. # Monde - **Translation:** \\"world\\" - **Analysis:** \\"Monde\\" refers to the world in its broadest sense, encompassing everything outside of oneself—the entirety of external reality, society, or the physical planet. It can represent both a physical location and a conceptual space, including societies, cultures, challenges, and the interactions between them. The choice of the word \\"monde\\" broadens the spectrum of what is being faced, highlighting both the vastness and complexity of what the subject confronts. # Combined Analysis When the components are combined into \\"faire face au monde,\\" the phrase metaphorically suggests engaging in a proactive or confrontational manner with the complexities, challenges, or realities of the world. The action-oriented \\"faire\\" coupled with \\"face\\" amplifies the notion of confrontation or direct engagement, not just passively experiencing or observing the world but actively participating in or tackling its complexities. The prepositional phrase \\"au monde\\" specifies the target of this action—the world in its entirety, with all its sociocultural, existential, or personal challenges. In sum, \\"faire face au monde\\" encapsulates a rich and nuanced directive for individual or collective action, highlighting a conscious decision to engage, confront, or address the broader realities and challenges of the external world. It speaks to human agency, resilience, and the existential journey of navigating life's complexities."},{"prompt":"What is the imperative of permettre","completion":"The imperative form of the verb \\"permettre\\" (to allow, to permit) in French depends on the grammatical person it is directed to. In French, the imperative is used to give orders, advice, or encourage someone to do something. Here are the imperative forms of \\"permettre\\": - **Tu form (informal singular):** Permets - \\"Allow\\" or \\"Permit\\" (when speaking informally to one person) - **Nous form (first-person plural):** Permettons - \\"Let’s allow\\" or \\"Let’s permit\\" (when suggesting or encouraging a group that includes the speaker) - **Vous form (formal singular/plural):** Permettez - \\"Allow\\" or \\"Permit\\" (when giving an order or making a request either formally to one person or to multiple people) It's important to remember that in French, the imperative mood can omit the subject pronoun (tu, nous, vous), unlike in English where the subject \\"you\\" or \\"let's\\" is often implicit in commands or suggestions."},{"prompt":"Using tu?","completion":"Yes, for the \\"tu\\" form in the imperative mood of \\"permettre,\\" you would use: Permets So, if you're instructing or asking someone informally to allow or permit something, you would say: **Permets.**"},{"prompt":"And how it would be let me?","completion":"In French, to express \\"let me\\" as a request for permission in the context of using the verb \\"permettre,\\" you would use the imperative form in a slightly different construction by incorporating the reflexive pronoun \\"me\\" to indicate \\"me\\" or \\"myself.\\" However, with \\"permettre,\\" you're more likely to structure the request differently, as \\"permettre\\" doesn't directly translate to a \\"let me\\" formulation. A common way to say \\"let me\\" in the sense of asking for permission or the ability to do something is to use \\"laisser,\\" which translates more directly to \\"let\\" in this context. For example, \\"Let me speak\\" would be \\"Laisse-moi parler.\\" If you're specifically looking to use \\"permettre\\" in a way that translates the essence of \\"let me,\\" you might construct it differently, as the direct imperative \\"let me\\" doesn't smoothly translate with \\"permettre.\\" However, you could say something like \\"Permets-moi de...\\" which means \\"Allow me to...\\" or \\"Permit me to...\\" - **Permettre in this sense:** Permets-moi de + infinitive verb. - For example, \\"Allow me to speak\\" = \\"Permets-moi de parler.\\" This structure turns the focus to asking for permission to perform the subsequent action, and it fits neatly with the use of \\"permettre\\" to convey \\"let me.\\""},{"prompt":"translate to English, don’t change symbol and line break.

[아빠, 노크도 없이 이러면 안 되지. 나도 프라이버시가 있다고.] 나는 얼른 달려가서 배꼽 인사를 했다. “안녕히 주무세요.” “성국아, 9시가 넘었어. 이제 자야지. 아빠가 재워줄까?” [그건 정말 사양할게. 차라리 베개 안고 잘 거야.] 나는 얼른 베개를 안고 침대로 뛰어 올라갔다. 아빠는 그런 나를 보며 흐뭇한 미소를 지으며 방 불을 껐다. “성국아, 잘 자.” 나는 눈을 감고 자는 척을 했지만, 머릿속으로는 민국이의 데뷔를 위한 플랜을 짜고 있었다. * * 유치원 가방을 내던지자마자 나는 민국이에게로 달려갔다. 민국이를 봐주시는 이모님은 내 간식을 챙기러 부엌에 간 타이밍이었다. 나는 민국이를 끌어다가 TV 앞에 앉혔다. 그리고 TV를 켰다. TV 유치원을 하기 전 광고 시간이었다. 시청자들을 고려해서인지 아역들이 나오는 광고들이 연이어 나왔다. “밍구가, 저거 봐.” “헤헤.” 민국이는 그저 입을 벌린 채 광고를 봤다. “밍구가, 입을 좀 더 벌리고 웃어봐.” “헤에헤에.” 민국이는 생각보다 내 지시를 잘 따랐다. “성국아, 민국이 데리고 뭐 하는 거야?” 이모님이 오는 바람에 내 연기 수업은 시작도 제대로 하기 전에 끝이 났다. “성국아, 우유랑 바나나 먹자.” [오늘은 어쩔 수 없군.] 나는 이모님이 내민 우유와 바나나를 먹으며 민국이에게 아역이 나오는 광고만 집중적으로 보여줬다. [우선은 많이 보는 게 공부가 되는 거야.] 민국이는 넋 나간 얼굴로 TV를 쳐다봤다. “엄마 왔어.” 문이 열리면서 엄마와 김미영이 함께 퇴근했다. 김미영은 이제 우리와 같은 아파트 다른 동에 살았다. 수유의 건물을 정리하고, 잠실의 24평 아파트를 사고 나머지 금액으로는 근처의 작은 상가를 두 채 정도 샀다고 들었다. [역시 김미영의 부동산 감각은 탁월해.] 솔직히 재벌로 살다 보니 부동산을 매매하는 일은 나와 크게 관계가 없었다. 태어났을 때부터 서울 가장 비싼 땅에 집이 몇 채나 됐고, 원한다면 어디든 집을 살 수도 있었다. 서울뿐 아니라 뉴욕과 파리 어느 나라에도 말이다. 종종 공장 부지나 본사 이전 등으로 땅을 매입하는 경우가 있었지만, 그런 것은 어차피 회사에 따로 담당하는 전문가들이 있었다. 아무리 싼 땅도 삼전 그룹의 계열사가 들어서는 순간, 도시가 생기고 땅값이 치솟기도 했다. 부동산 시장을 따라가는 게 아니라, 한마디로 부동산 시장 자체를 만드는 역할을 한 것이다. [김미영과 조만간 심도 깊은 대화 좀 나눠야겠어.] 나는 종종걸음으로 김미영에게 다가가 인사를 했다. “안냥하세요.” “성국아, 안 본 사이에 키가 더 큰 것 같은데. 성국이 엄마, 맞죠?” “네, 언니. 성국이 내복 좀 보세요. 석 달 전에 산 건데 벌써 발목 보여요.” “진짜네. 성국이 키도 엄청 크겠다.” [당연하지.] 아빠가 어림잡아 180센티미터. 엄마도 165센티미터가 넘는 키였다. 이런 유전자라면 내 키도 못 해도 아빠는 넘어설 것 같았다. 내가 저번 생에서 178센티미터였으니, 이번 생에서는 180센티미터를 드디어 넘어볼 수도 있을 것 같았다. [아차, 깜빡했네.] 나는 김미영의 손을 잡고 TV 앞으로 끌고 갔다. TV 앞에는 민국이가 있었다. “성국아, 왜 그래?” “밍구기.” 나는 손가락으로 민국이를 가리켰다. “민국이가 왜?” “밍구기가 저거 하루 종일 봐요.” 때마침 아역이 나오는 광고였다. 물론 이 시간에 저 광고가 나온다는 것은 이미 알고 있었다. 김미영은 예리한 눈으로 민국이를 살폈다. 민국이는 내 교육 덕분에 광고 모델을 보면서 표정을 흉내 냈다. 이런 민국이를 어엿한 기획사 대표 김미영이 놓칠 리가 없었다. “민국아, 지금 혹시 저 표정 따라 한 거야?” “녜에!” “민국아, 너도 저렇게 하고 싶어?” 민국이가 슬쩍 내 눈치를 살폈다. 나는 두 눈을 끔뻑했다. 어서 그렇다고 대답하란 신호였다. “녜에!” “언니, 민국이가 뭐라는 거예요?” “성국이 엄마, 민국이가 TV 광고 보면서 흉내 내는데, 제법인데요.” “성국이 하는 거 보고 따라 하는 건가….” “성국이 엄마, 안 그래도 다음 주에 곽 감독님이랑 점심 먹기로 했거든요. 선미 씨 광고 때문에요. 제가 한번 민국이가 응시해볼 만한 광고 알아볼까요?” “민국이를요….” 엄마는 걱정이 앞서는 모양이었다. 나는 얼른 엄마에게 달려가서 다리에 매달렸다. [엄마, 민국이도 이제 지 밥값을 벌어야지. 언제까지 집에서 저렇게 놀릴 거야? 우리처럼 가난한 처지에.] “성국아, 잠깐만.” 엄마는 나를 안아 들고는 민국이에게로 갔다. “민국아, 엄마 좀 봐.” “엄. 마!” 민국이는 헤벌쭉 웃으며 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “민국아, 너도 TV 나오고 싶어. 형아처럼?” 나는 얼른 그러라는 눈빛을 민국이에게 보냈다. 민국이는 해맑은 얼굴로 크게 고개를 끄덕였다. 나는 몰래 엄지손가락을 치켜세웠다. [전민국, 잘했어.] * * 유치원이 끝나자마자 나는 엄마 손을 잡고 민국이와 함께 오디션장으로 향했다. 곽 감독이 새로 찍는 세제 광고에 나올 아역이 필요하단 연락이 왔기 때문이다. 오디션장은 곽 감독의 광고 회사였다. 학동역 부근에 위치한 곽 감독의 광고 회사는 단독 주택을 개조한 곳으로 마당에는 거북이가 돌아다니고 있었다. 내가 민국이의 손을 잡고 들어서자 나를 알아본 조연출 한 명이 반갑게 인사를 했다. “성국아, 나 기억나? 진희 누나야.” [기억나지, 당연히. 진희 누나, 맨날 뒤에서 곽 감독 성격 이상하다고 투덜거렸잖아. 근데 아직도 잘 다니네.] “와, 네가 성국이 동생이구나. 동생도 정말 잘생겼네요.” [그 말은 오늘만 용서해줄게. 오늘은 민국이 오디션이니까.] 조연출은 우리를 대기장으로 안내했다. “세 살에서 다섯 살까지 오디션 보거든요. 어머니, 성국이도 보는 거 어때요? 성국이가 광고계를 떠나서 사람들이 얼마나 아쉬워하는지 몰라요.” “성국이는 요즘 공부하느라 정신이 없어요.” “아쉽네요.” 광고 회사 안쪽에 마련된 대기 장소에는 이미 열댓 명의 아이들이 있었다. 조연출의 말대로 세 살부터 다섯 살 정도로 보이는 아이들이었다. 내가 대기실에 들어서자 순간 모두 긴장한 기색이 역력했다. 아무리 내가 이 업계를 떠난 지 좀 됐지만, 모두들 나를 기억하고 있었다. 이때, 한 아이의 엄마가 나를 보더니 투덜거렸다. “성국이도 오디션 보는 거예요?” “아니에요. 성국이는 오늘 동생 때문에 같이 온 거예요.” 조연출이 얼른 설명을 했지만, 대기실의 분위기는 여전히 차가웠다. “누구 동생이라고 특혜 더 주고 그런 거 아니죠?” 떽떽거리는 여자의 목소리가 익숙했다. [어디서 들어본 목소리인데.] 나는 여자와 여자의 곁에 앉은 남자아이를 쳐다봤다. 내 또래로 보이는 남자아이는 동그란 눈에 별 특색 없는 얼굴이었다. 그리고 그 아이의 엄마로 보이는 여자는. [맞다! 덕풍 제지!] 남자아이의 이름은 이재희. 내 인생 첫 오디션에서 처음으로 좌절을 보게 해준 녀석이었다. 덕풍 제지 손자라는 이유로 광고 모델로 발탁됐지만, 곱게 자라서 세상 물정 모르던 녀석은 수없이 NG를 낸 바람에 촬영 중에 잘리고 말았다. 재능도 없으면서 아직도 광고계를 어슬렁거리고 있는 모양이었다. 방금 전 특혜니 뭐니 따진 여자는 아들에게 추억을 만들어준단 이유로 덕풍 제지 백으로 모두를 들러리 세우고 광고 모델로 만든 덕풍 제지의 며느리였다. 그런데 어딘가 여자의 행색이 조금 초라해 보였다. 그때도 들고 있던 샤랭의 가방은 모서리가 해졌고, 분명 그때도 입고 있었던 것 같은 트위드 재질의 재킷과 스커트도 낡아 보였다. 명품이지만 유행 지난 느낌이 확실히 있었다. 나는 엄마를 올려다봤다. 4년 전 엄마는 돌이 막 지난 나를 안고 버스를 타고 이태원에 있는 삼전 기획에 오디션을 보러 갔었다. 그때 엄마는 유일한 외출복인 검은색 원피스를 조금 창피해했다. 하지만 지금의 엄마는 비록 명품은 아니지만 깔끔한 재킷에 청바지를 매치해서 입었다. 작년에 아빠가 생일 선물이라며 사준 국내 브랜드의 핸드백도 들고 있었다. 그리고 그때나 지금이나 엄마는 여전히 아름다웠다. 나는 저벅저벅 이재희에게 걸어갔다. “안냥.” 내가 먼저 환하게 웃자 이재희는 영문도 모른 채 배시시 웃으며 인사를 받아줬다. “안냥.” 이재희의 엄마는 못마땅한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 나 기억하니?” [물론 기억하지. 중소기업 며느리.] 하지만 보통의 아이들은 결코 기억할 수 없는 시간이었다. 나는 모른 척 정중하게 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요. 전성국입니다.” “우리 아들 대타로 네가 광고 찍어서 대박 난 거야. 그러니까 네가 광고 찍은 거 다 우리 덕분이야.” [할 말은 많지만, 하지 않겠어. 중소기업 며느리.] 나는 입을 앙다물었다. “성구가. 나 사인 좀.” 이재희는 예전에는 좀 예민해 보였지만, 엄마만큼 성격이 나쁘지는 않은 모양이었다. 나는 이재희가 내민 종이에 전성국 이름을 선명히 적어줬다. “고마워, 성구가.” “재희야.” “응?” “카메라 앞에선 무조건 웃어.” 이건 내가 이재희에게 주는 연기 팁이었다. 어쨌든 이 녀석이 그때 내 말을 듣고 임선미의 성형한 코를 가격해준 덕분에 내가 이 자리에 있는 것이기도 했다. 이재희는 알 듯 모를 듯 한 얼굴로 고개를 살짝 까딱였다. “재희야, 머리 좀 다시 만지자.” 덕풍 제지 며느리는 신경질적으로 재희와 나를 떨어뜨려 났다. 나는 다시 민국이 옆으로 돌아왔다. 벌써 넉살 좋은 몇 명의 아이 엄마들이 다가와서 나에게 사인을 청했다. 이때, 안에서 이재희를 호출하는 목소리가 들렸다. “재희야, 어서 가자.” 이재희는 엄마의 재촉에 못 이겨 오디션장 안으로 들어가면서 나를 흘끔 쳐다봤다. 나는 눈을 찡끗해줬다. “근데 저 여자는 맨날 만나네.” 나에게 사인을 받던 여자가 중얼거렸다. “저분 아세요?” 엄마가 조심스레 물었다. 사실 엄마도 덕풍 제지 며느리를 한눈에 알아봤지만 모른 척하고 있었다. “예전 덕풍 제지 며느리잖아요. 근데 덕풍 제지 회장이 젊은 여자한테 빠져서 재산을 모조리 그 여자한테 넘기는 바람에 저 집 아들들은 건져서 나온 게 없대요. 다들 순식간에 망해서 폐인 되고, 아들 하나 어떻게든 연예인 만들어서 성공시키려고 돌아다니는데. 제가 보기에 아들이 영 재능이 없어요.” “그렇군요.” 엄마의 표정이 조금 시무룩해졌다. 그러더니 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 너 첫 광고 오디션 때 네가 인사한 애랑 같이 경쟁했었어. 돌 막 지난 때라 기억 안 날 거야.” [엄마, 뭔 소리야. 나 다 기억해.] 김미영도 혀를 낮게 찼다. “아, 저 집이 덕풍 제지였군요.” “언니도 알아요?” “저 집 소문 파다했어요. 며느리가 그때 삼전 기획에 돈 주고 광고 하나 밀어 넣었다가 성국이한테 밀렸잖아요. 회사에서도 말 많았어요.” 달칵. 오디션장 문이 열리면서 이재희가 엄마와 나왔다. 꽤 밝은 얼굴이었다. 조연출이 웃으며 손을 흔들었다. “민국이 차례예요.” “언니, 제가 같이 갈게요. 성국이 좀 봐주세요.” 나는 민국이 손을 꼭 잡고 눈을 마주쳤다. [전민국. 너도 이제 세 살이야. 형 말 알지?] 민국이는 다부지게 고개를 끄덕이며 힘차게 대답했다. “바압갑!”","completion":"Episode 38 After doing his business, Minguk with his refreshing face kept grinning at me. I glared hard at Minguk. “Big bro.” “Minggu. From now on, listen well to big bro.” “Okay!” His response was good. “You’re now three years old, so you should know about our family’s situation. Understand?” Cock-tilted. Minguk cocked his head. I firmly grabbed Minguk’s head. “Pay attention.” “Okay!” His response was good again. “Minggu. Our mom and dad are orphans. That means, to survive in South Korea, both you and I need to stay sharp and live wisely.” “Okay!” [I wonder if he gets what I’m saying.] Anyway, I finished my speech. “Since I managed to earn my keep right after my first birthday, being three means you're of age to more than earn your keep. Got it?” “Yes! Big bro. Happy. Happy. Minggu will do.” “That’s right, now you'll also earn your keep.” \\"Yes!\\" Minguk clenched his fists tight. That night, I began devising a detailed plan for Minguk's debut, someone ignorant of the world. Given that Minguk somewhat lacks in looks, he needs to compete with his childlike expressions. That means I need to start teaching him acting lessons from tomorrow. Unbelievable, the one who conquered the child acting scene in South Korea is becoming a teacher, Minguk is really lucky. “Seonguk, why aren’t you sleeping? What are you doing?” My freshly washed dad peeked into the room. [Dad, you can’t just come in without knocking. I have my privacy too.] I quickly ran and greeted him with a stomach bow. “Good night.” “Seonguk, it’s past 9. You should sleep now. Want dad to put you to bed?” [I’d rather not. I’ll just hug my pillow and sleep.] I jumped onto the bed with my pillow. Dad smiled warmly at me and turned off the light. “Seonguk, sleep well.” I pretended to be asleep with my eyes closed, but in my mind, I was planning Minguk’s debut. * * As soon as I dropped my kindergarten bag, I hurried to Minguk. The timing was just when our nanny went to the kitchen to prepare my snack. I pulled Minguk to sit in front of the TV and turned it on. It was an advertisement time before TV Kindergarten. Considering the viewers, a series of commercials featuring children followed. “Minggu, look at that.” “Hehe.” Minguk just watched the commercials with his mouth open. “Minggu, open your mouth wider and smile.” “Hehehehe.” Minguk surprisingly followed my instructions well. “Seonguk, what are you doing with Minguk?” Our nanny came, and my acting lesson had to end before it even properly began. “Seonguk, let’s have milk and bananas.” [Can’t help it today.] While having the milk and bananas given by our nanny, I intentionally showed Minguk commercials featuring children. [Watching a lot will be your first step to learning.] Minguk watched the TV with a blank expression. “Mom’s back.” The door opened, and mom came back from work with Kim Miyoung. Kim Miyoung now lived in a different building of the same apartment complex as us. After settling the building in Suyu, she bought a 24-pyeong apartment in Jamsil and with the remaining money, she purchased a couple of small commercial properties nearby. [Kim Miyoung's real estate sense is truly exceptional.] Honestly, living as a chaebol, real estate transactions were not much of my concern. Since birth, we had several houses in Seoul's most expensive areas, and if we wanted, we could buy houses anywhere, not just in Seoul but also in New York and Paris. Occasionally, there were times when land was bought for factory sites or company relocations, but anyway, the company had dedicated experts for that. Any cheap land would turn into a city the moment a Samsung Group affiliate set foot and the land price would skyrocket. It wasn't about following the real estate market; in a word, it was about creating the real estate market itself. [I should have a deep conversation with Kim Miyoung soon.] I hurried to Kim Miyoung and greeted her. “Hello.” “Seonguk, you seem to have grown even taller. You’re Seonguk’s mom, right?” “Yes, sister. Look at Seonguk’s undershirt. Bought it three months ago, and it already shows his ankles.” “Really. Seonguk’s going to be really tall.” [Of course.] Dad was roughly 180 centimeters tall. Mom also exceeded 165 centimeters. With such genetics, it seemed likely I'd surpass dad. In my past life, I was 178 centimeters, so in this life, I was hoping to finally exceed 180 centimeters. [I almost forgot.] I grabbed Kim Miyoung’s hand and led her to the TV. Minguk was there. “Seonguk, what’s wrong?” “Mingguki.” I pointed my finger at Minguk. “What about Minguk?” “Mingguki watches that all day.” Just then, a child actor’s commercial was on. I certainly knew that commercial was scheduled for this time. Kim Miyoung scrutinized Minguk keenly. Thanks to my education, Minguk mimicked the expressions of the commercial models. It was impossible for Kim Miyoung, a capable agency president, to overlook such a Minguk. “Minguk, did you just imitate that expression?” “Yes!” “Minguk, do you want to do that too?” Minguk stealthily glanced at me. I blinked significantly. It was a signal for him to say yes. “Yes!” “Sister, what’s Minguk saying?” “Seonguk’s mom, Minguk was imitating the TV commercial very well, it's his talent.” “Seonguk must have followed after seeing him do that….” “Seonguk’s mom, I have lunch with Director Gwak next week because of Sunmi’s commercial. Shall I look into commercials that Minguk can apply for?” “Minguk?” Mom seemed concerned. I immediately ran to mom and clung to her legs. [Mom, Minguk should earn his keep now. How long will he just play at home? Considering our poor situation.] “Seonguk, just a moment.” Mom lifted me and went to Minguk. “Minguk, look at mom.” “Mom. Ma!” Minguk looked at mom with a bright smile. “Minguk, do you want to be on TV too? Like your brother?” I quickly sent a convincing look to Minguk. Minguk nodded his head vigorously with a bright face. I secretly raised my thumb. [Well done, Mingu k.] * * Right after kindergarten ended, I held my mom’s hand, and together with Minguk, we headed to the audition site. It was because we received a call that a new child actor was needed for the detergent commercial directed by Director Gwak. The audition site was Director Gwak’s advertising company. Located near Hakdong Station, Director Gwak’s advertising company was a remodeled single-household home with turtles roaming the yard. As I entered holding Minguk’s hand, a familiar assistant director greeted us warmly. “Seonguk, remember me? It’s Jinhee noona.” [Of course, I remember. You always complained about Director Gwak’s strange personality behind his back. But you’re still working well.] “Wow, you’re Seonguk's brother. He’s really handsome.” [That comment will be forgiven just for today. Today is Minguk’s audition.] The assistant director led us to the waiting area. “Children from three to five years old are auditioning today. Mom, how about Seonguk tries out too? People lament how much they miss Seonguk since he left the commercial world.” “Seonguk is too busy studying these days.” “That’s a shame.” Inside the waiting area, prepared inside the advertisement company, there were already about a dozen children. As the assistant director said, they seemed to be between three to five years old. As I entered the waiting room, everyone tensed up for a moment. Even though I’ve been away from this industry for a while, everyone remembered me. Then, a child's mother looked at me and grumbled. “Is Seonguk auditioning too?” “No. Seonguk came today because of his brother.” The assistant director quickly explained, but the atmosphere in the waiting room remained cold. “They're not giving him any special treatment because he's someone’s brother, right?” The grumbling woman’s voice sounded familiar. [I’ve heard this voice somewhere before.] I looked at the woman and the boy beside her. The boy, who seemed to be around my age, had round eyes and an unremarkable face. The woman, appearing to be the boy’s mother, turned out to be… [Right! Deokpoong Paper!] The boy’s name was Lee Jaehee. In my first audition, he was the very one who initially caused me frustration. Selected as a commercial model for being the grandson of Deokpoong Paper, but due to growing up sheltered and unaware of the world, he caused endless NGs during the shoot and ended up getting cut. Without talent, he was still loitering around the advertising world. The woman who was questioning about special treatment and pushing everyone aside to make her son a commercial model due to being Deokpoong Paper’s daughter-in-law. But somehow, the woman's appearance seemed a bit shabby. The Chanel bag she was still carrying had worn corners, and the tweed material jacket and skirt she seemed to have worn before looked old. Even though they were designer brands, they definitely felt outdated. I looked up at my mom. Four years ago, mom carried me, who had just turned one, on a bus to Samjeon Planning in Itaewon for an audition. Back then, mom was a bit embarrassed by her only black dress for going out. But now, mom was wearing a clean jacket and jeans, although not designer brands. She was holding a handbag from a domestic brand, a birthday present from dad last year. And whether then or now, mom was still beautiful. I walked confidently toward Jaehee. “Hello.” When I smiled brightly first, Jaehee, not understanding the situation, shyly reciprocated the greeting. “Hello.” Jaehee’s mom looked at me with displeasure. “Seonguk, do you remember me?” [Of course, I remember. A daughter-in-law of a medium-sized enterprise.] However, an ordinary child could never remember such a time. I politely greeted as if I didn’t know. “Hello, I’m Seonguk Jeon.” “When you were a substitute, you hit a jackpot in a commercial. So, everything you did in commercials is all thanks to us.” [I have a lot to say, but I won’t. A daughter-in-law of a medium-sized enterprise.] I kept my mouth shut. “Seonguga. Can I have your autograph?” Jaehee seemed not as bad-tempered as his mother. I signed the paper Jaehee handed me with “Seonguk Jeon” clearly. “Thanks, Seonguga.” “Jaehee.” “Hm?” “Always smile in front of the camera.” This was my acting tip for Jaehee. After all, because he followed my advice and hit Lim Seonmi’s nose, I was in this position. Jaehee seemed to understand but nodded slightly in confusion. “Jaehee, let’s tidy up your hair.” Deokpoong Paper’s daughter-in-law irritably separated Jaehee and me. I returned next to Minguk. Several outgoing mothers approached me, asking for an autograph. Then, inside, Jaehee was called. “Jaehee, hurry up.” Jaehee reluctantly went inside the audition room, glancing back at me. I made a little squinting gesture. “But she seems to show up everywhere.” A woman receiving my autograph murmured. “Do you know that woman?” Mom cautiously asked. In fact, mom recognized Deokpoong Paper’s daughter-in-law at a glance but pretended not to know. “Isn’t she the former daughter-in-law of Deokpoong Paper? But the chairman of Deokpoong Paper fell for a young woman and transferred all his wealth to her, leaving nothing for his sons. They all quickly became destitute; she’s going around trying desperately to make her son a successful celebrity. But from what I see, her son lacks talent.” “I see.” Mom’s expression slightly darkened. Then she held my hand. “Seonguk, during your first commercial audition, you competed with that kid. You won’t remember since you were just over a year old.” [I remember, Mom. What are you talking about.] Kim Miyoung also clicked her tongue. “Oh, that was the Deokpoong Paper family.” “Sister, you knew?” “That family was notorious. The daughter-in-law pushed money into Samjeon Planning to slot in a commercial but got pushed out by Seonguk. The company was buzzing with talks about it.” Clack. The audition room door opened, and Jaehee came out with his mom. He seemed quite happy. The assistant director waved happily. “It’s Minguk’s turn.” “Sister, I’ll go with him. Please watch Seonguk.” I looked Minguk in the eye holding his hand tightly. [Minguk. You’re three now. You know what big brother said, right?] Minguk nodded vigorously and replied with energy. “Will do!”"}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],P={key:0},R={key:1};function W(n,e,l,m,i,s){const g=y("PoemCard");return t(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),a("div",C,[e[3]||(e[3]=a("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(a("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),a("div",E,[(t(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(t(),k(g,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+h(i.searchQuery)+'".
