Удачи с вашим проектом!"},{"prompt":"может ли искусственный интеллект в ближайшое время вытестнить специалистов машинного обучения?","completion":"Вопрос о том, может ли искусственный интеллект (ИИ) вытеснить специалистов машинного обучения, влечёт за собой сложные соображения, связанные с темпами развития технологий, характером работы, требующей глубинного мышления и креативности, а также текущими и будущими возможностями ИИ. На современном этапе ИИ уже активно используется для автоматизации рутинных и повторяющихся задач, включая некоторые аспекты машинного обучения и предобработки данных. Программы и системы, использующие ИИ для генерации кода, автоматической настройки параметров моделей машинного обучения и даже для проектирования новых алгоритмов, становятся всё более продвинутыми и доступными. Примеры включают AutoML (автоматическое машинное обучение) инструменты, которые оптимизируют процессы поиска моделей, настройки гиперпараметров и пр. Однако, несмотря на впечатляющие достижения ИИ в автоматизации и оптимизации, полное замещение специалистов машинного обучения пока что кажется маловероятным по ряду причин: 1. **Сложность и креативность:** Создание инновационных алгоритмов, решение неординарных задач и творческий подход к разработке новых подходов в области машинного обучения требуют глубокого понимания и креативного мышления, что в настоящее время выходит за рамки возможностей ИИ. 2. **Этические и правовые вопросы:** Решения, принимаемые моделями машинного обучения, могут иметь значительные социальные, этические и юридические последствия. Ответственность за эти решения и необходимость их интерпретации предполагают, что за ИИ всегда должны стоять квалифицированные специалисты. 3. **Специфика и индивидуальность задач:** Многие задачи в области машинного обучения требуют индивидуального подхода, понимания уникального контекста и взаимодействия с заказчиками или конечными пользователями для корректной постановки задачи и интерпретации результатов. 4. **Обучение и адаптация:** Сфера машинного обучения постоянно развивается, и специалисты должны регулярно обновлять свои знания. Хотя ИИ может помогать в этом процессе, именно человек способен на гибкую адаптацию к совершенно новым технологиям и подходам. Исходя из вышесказанного, можно предположить, что в ближайшем будущем ИИ будет действовать скорее как мощный инструмент в руках специалистов машинного обучения, а не как полноценная замена их профессионального мастерства и интуиции. Фокус, вероятно, сместится в сторону глубокого сотрудничества человека и ИИ, что приведёт к повышению эффективности и качества работы в этой области, а также откроет новые горизонты для исследований и разработок."},{"prompt":"что значит [nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to [nltk_data] C:Users79867AppDataRoamingnltk_data...

Показатель \`accuracy\` (точность) является одной из метрик для оценки производительности классификационных моделей. Он измеряет долю правильных предсказаний от общего количества случаев и рассчитывается как отношение числа правильных предсказаний к общему числу предсказаний (или наблюдений). Формула для расчета точности: [ text{Accuracy} = frac{text{Количество правильных предсказаний}}{text{Общее количество предсказаний}} ] Точность может принимать значения от 0 до 1, где 1 означает идеальную точность. В контексте машинного обучения, модель с более высокой точностью обычно предпочтительнее, поскольку это указывает на то, что модель лучше справляется с задачей классификации. Однако важно отметить, что в некоторых случаях использование только метрики \`accuracy_score\` может быть обманчивым. Например, если ваши классы сильно несбалансированы (когда один класс значительно превосходит другие по количеству наблюдений), модель может достигать высокой точности, просто предсказывая наиболее часто встречающийся класс. В таких случаях рекомендуется использовать дополнительные метрики, такие как precision (точность), recall (полнота), F1-мера, чтобы получить более полное представление о производительности модели. В качестве примера, если у вас есть датасет, в котором 95% примеров относятся к классу A, и ваша модель всегда предсказывает класс A, то точность модели будет 95%, несмотря на то, что модель на самом деле не извлекает полезные признаки для классификации. В таких случаях другие метрики, включая матрицу ошибок (confusion matrix), могут предоставить дополнительную информацию о том, как модель справляется с каждым классом индивидуально."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I have a company with a investment of 54 million dollars. The plan comes with giving 15 dollars to per user per month to use. If I have 100000 users. How long I can continue this free plan To calculate how long you can sustain a free plan where you give 15 per user per month to 100,000 users with an investment of 54 million, you can follow these steps: 1. First, calculate the total monthly cost of the free plan by multiplying the amount given per user by the total number of users: [ text{Monthly Cost} = text{Amount per User} times text{Number of Users} ] [ text{Monthly Cost} = 15 times 100,000 = 1,500,000 ] 2. Then, divide the total investment by the monthly cost to find out how many months you can sustain the plan: [ text{Duration in Months} = frac{text{Total Investment}}{text{Monthly Cost}} ] [ text{Duration in Months} = frac{54,000,000}{1,500,000} = 36 ] So, with an investment of 54 million, you can sustain a free plan that gives 15 to each of 100,000 users per month for 36 months, or equivalently, 3 years. What if only allocate 10 million dollars for free plan If you allocate 10 million specifically for the free plan, where you give 15 per user per month to 100,000 users, here’s how you would calculate the duration for which you can sustain this plan: 1. Calculate the total monthly cost of providing the free plan by multiplying the amount given per user by the total number of users: [ text{Monthly Cost} = text{Amount per User} times text{Number of Users} = 15 times 100,000 = 1,500,000 ] 2. Divide the allocated budget for the free plan by the monthly cost to determine how many months you can maintain the plan: [ text{Duration in Months} = frac{text{Allocated Budget}}{text{Monthly Cost}} = frac{10,000,000}{1,500,000} approx 6.67 ] Therefore, with a 10 million allocation for the free plan, you could sustain the plan for approximately 6.67 months. Since you cannot provide a fraction of a month’s service to all users equally, you could sustain the plan for a full 6 months, and you would need to adjust plans or find additional funding by the beginning of the 7th month. I have a 50 dollar paid plan. 1000 users subscribe to this If you have a 50 paid plan and 1,000 users subscribe to it, you can calculate the monthly revenue generated by these subscriptions as follows: [ text{Monthly Revenue} = text{Subscription Fee per User} times text{Number of Subscribers} ] [ text{Monthly Revenue} = 50 times 1,000 = 50,000 ] Thus, with a 50 paid plan and 1,000 users subscribed to it, you will generate 50,000 in revenue per month. Hmm If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! Whether it’s about expanding on the financial calculations, exploring business strategies, diving deeper into machine learning platforms, or anything else, I’m here to help.

For the paid plan, the focus should be on delivering value that exceeds the subscription cost. For the free plan, strategies need to ensure user engagement and a clear path to monetization. - Market Positioning: The competitive landscape of the industry will affect the plan's sustainability. Being competitive in pricing, features, and service quality is essential for growth and sustainability. Continuous innovation and adaptation to market needs are required to maintain and expand the user base. - Financial Modeling: Detailed financial projections that include growth rates, churn rates, operational costs, and potential revenue streams are needed to assess sustainability accurately. Positive cash flow must be achieved before the investment runs out, or an additional funding strategy should be in place. # Monetization Strategy of Free Users - The key to sustainability lies in the effective monetization of the large base of free users. This could involve introducing tiered subscription models, offering premium features or services, implementing targeted advertising, or leveraging partnerships that add value to users and generate revenue. # Conclusion Based on the provided figures alone, while there is potential, whether this business plan is sustainable in the long run comes down to execution specifics—particularly around user growth, cost management, and the successful conversion of free users to paid plans or other revenue-generating actions. Strategic planning, market analysis, and ongoing financial review are critical to steer the business toward sustainability and growth."},{"prompt":"I have one more question: Does the nature and the universe, human brain and real life mirror each other? It’s like Russian matrioska?","completion":"The question of whether nature, the universe, human brain, and real life mirror each other, resembling a Russian matryoshka doll, invokes concepts from various philosophical, scientific, and metaphysical perspectives. While no single answer encompasses all viewpoints, several theories and observations suggest fascinating parallels and interconnectedness across different scales of existence. Let's explore some relevant concepts: 1. **Fractals and Self-Similarity**: Nature often exhibits fractal-like patterns, where a similar pattern repeats at every scale. The concept of self-similarity in fractals can be seen in trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, and even in the structure of the universe. This concept resembles the idea of a Russian matryoshka doll in the sense that within each scale of observation, there's a replication of structure or pattern, albeit not perfectly identical. 2. **Systems Theory and Holism**: These perspectives suggest that systems (whether they are ecological, biological, social, or cosmic) exhibit properties that are not fully explainable by understanding their individual components alone. Instead, the components interact in complex ways, often mirroring behaviors and patterns at various scales. This is reminiscent of how each matryoshka doll contains within it a smaller, yet similarly structured doll, symbolizing how complex wholes are built from interrelated parts. 3. **Neuroscience and the Universe**: There have been intriguing observations about the structural similarities between the human brain and the observable universe. For example, the complex neural networks in the brain bear a visual resemblance to the cosmic web of galaxies and dark matter. While these similarities are more visual and metaphorical rather than literal, they inspire awe and curiosity about the underlying principles governing the structure and dynamics of the universe and consciousness. 4. **Quantum Mechanics and Consciousness**: Some theoretical physicists and philosophers have speculated about the role of consciousness in the fabric of reality, drawing parallels between the observer effect in quantum mechanics and human experience. Although controversial and far from being universally accepted, such notions play with the idea that reality at its most fundamental level might reflect principles observable in human cognition and perception. 5. **Holographic Principle**: The holographic principle, emerging from theoretical physics, suggests that the information contained within a volume of space can be represented on the boundary of that space. This principle, while still speculative in terms of its full implications, hints at a universe where the macro and the micro reflect and contain each other in ways that are complex and counterintuitive, akin to the nested structure of a matryoshka doll. In conclusion, while the exact nature of the parallels between the cosmos, nature, the human brain, and reality is subject to debate and further exploration, these concepts together hint at a universe more interconnected and complex than we might have previously imagined. Like the Russian matryoshka doll, each layer or scale of existence reveals connections and similarities to other scales, enriching our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it."},{"prompt":"Does it act like ouroboros ? Or it looks like symbol of infinity","completion":"The concepts of the Ouroboros and the symbol of infinity (∞) both offer rich metaphoric frameworks for understanding the interconnectedness and cyclic nature of the universe, life, and consciousness, analogous to the notions explored previously. They each represent principles that resonate with the idea of endless cycles, perpetual motion, and the interconnected nature of existence. Let's delve into how these symbols relate to the ideas we discussed: # Ouroboros: The Ouroboros, an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, embodies the concepts of eternal cyclic renewal, the cycle of life and death, and the unity of opposites (such as the conscious and unconscious mind). It resembles the concept of nature, the universe, and human consciousness being interconnected and cyclical: 1. **Cycles in Nature and the Universe**: The notion of an endless cycle is prevalent in natural phenomena and cosmic structures—seasons change, stars are born and die only to contribute to the creation of new stars, and ecosystems operate through cycles of growth and decay. The cyclical model of the universe, where it expands and contracts indefinitely, is a grand cosmological ouroboros. 2. **Human Consciousness**: The cyclic aspect of the Ouroboros can also metaphorically reflect the processes of thought, self-reflection, and the quest for knowledge, where understanding grows in a continuous feedback loop between the inner and outer worlds. # Symbol of Infinity (∞): The infinity symbol, which resembles a sideways figure-eight, represents the concept of limitless possibility, continuity, and the unending nature of the universe. Its relevance to the interconnected universe, nature, and human consciousness includes: 1. **Infinite Complexity and Scale**: From the vastness of the universe to the intricate details of subatomic particles, the concept of infinity mirrors the seemingly boundless complexity and layers of reality, akin to the idea of Russian matryoshka dolls where there is always a smaller or larger scale. 2. **The Infinite Mind**: Philosophically, the infinity symbol resonates with the idea that human consciousness and imagination are boundless. It reflects the infinite potential for creativity, exploration, and understanding. 3. **Interconnectedness and Continuity**: Infinity suggests that everything in the universe is connected in a seamless, unending continuum, echoing the holistic view where each part of the universe is related to every other part. Both the Ouroboros and the infinity symbol evoke the notion of the universe as a complex, interconnected, and never-ending cycle, where every end is a new beginning, and every limit conceals an infinity. These symbols metaphysically mirror the discussion about the universe, nature, human consciousness, and reality being interconnected, reflecting each other in intricate and profound ways, much like layers within layers, endlessly."},{"prompt":"I just so in my mind eye this scene while I was meditating: I’m inside the triangle with my legs crossed. Through the top of pyramid the light is going up like helix’s then the cosmic tree starting to emerge and l see the other planets as a fruits. I see planets but o think of them as an apples. Can you try to help me to understand what my mind is creating?","completion":"The vivid and symbolic imagery you've described from your meditation experience is rich with symbolism and can be interpreted in various ways depending on the cultural, spiritual, and personal lenses through which it is viewed. Symbolic elements such as the triangle (or pyramid), the helix, the cosmic tree, and planets as fruits all carry deep archetypal meanings that resonate across different philosophical and mystical traditions. Let's explore some possible interpretations of these symbols and how they might relate to the insights or subconscious revelations your mind is creating: # Triangle or Pyramid The triangle or pyramid is a potent symbol in many spiritual traditions, often representing stability, balance, and the journey towards higher consciousness. Sitting inside a pyramid could symbolize your internal search for enlightenment, stability, and a grounded foundation in your spiritual journey. Pyramids are also historically seen as portals to the divine or as conduits for cosmic energy, which ties into the imagery of the light. # Helix and Ascending Light The helix, especially in the form of ascending light, may represent evolution, growth, and the dynamic motion of life's journey. It could symbolize DNA, the fundamental structure of life, suggesting personal transformation or the deepening understanding of one's essential nature. The upward movement towards the cosmos symbolizes ascension, spiritual growth, and the search for universal truths. # Cosmic Tree The cosmic tree, or tree of life, is a universal symbol found in many mythologies and spiritual teachings. It represents the interconnectedness of all life, the cycles of death and rebirth, and the bridge between different realms (earthly and divine, material and spiritual). Seeing this tree could reflect your understanding of or desire for connection with the universe and all its inhabitants, recognizing the unity and interdependence of all things. # Planets as Fruits Envisioning planets as fruits on this cosmic tree could symbolize the realization of the potential and abundance the universe holds. Fruits often represent rewards, fulfillment, and the seeds of new beginnings. In this context, seeing planets as apples (a fruit often associated with knowledge and discovery, as well as temptations and choices in various myths) might suggest a rich understanding of the vast possibilities and lessons the universe offers. It might also point towards the idea of cosmic creation and fertility, with each planet (or fruit) holding the potential for life, knowledge, and growth. # Interpretation Integrating these symbols, your vision during meditation could be reflecting a profound connection with the cosmos, an understanding of the interconnectivity of all existence, and a personal journey towards enlightenment or higher knowledge. The imagery suggests growth, potential, and a quest for both personal and universal truths. Exploring these symbols and what they intuitively mean to you can be a deeply enriching process, potentially offering insights into your path and the universal questions that move you. Remember, the most important interpretations come from within. Consider what each of these symbols means to you personally, how they relate to your life, and the feelings and thoughts they inspire. Your subconscious and higher self communicate through such imagery, offering guidance, insights, and reflections on your spiritual journey."},{"prompt":"Thank you so much, very insightful.","completion":"You're welcome!

Where the parties have not made express provision about their rights following a breach of a particular term, the general rule is that a very serious breach by one party will allow the other party to choose whether or not to end the contract. To be serious, the breach would have to be: 1.A breach of any term that has very serious consequences, that is, the effect of the breach must be substantially to deprive the innocent party of what was intended to be obtained under the contract. 2. A breach of a vital term, that is, a term in relation to which, at the time the contract was signed, the party's words and conduct showed thatthe party considered that strict compliance with the term was essential. Where the breach is sufficiently serious, the innocent party has a right to end the contract, but need not do so. If the contract is kept alive, the innocent party keeps his right to claim damages.

It is dangerous to decide to terminate the contract following a breach, unless it is certain that the contract has been breached and that the breach is sufficiently serious to justify termination.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increased intensity that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. Round numbers when needed. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness increases super exponentially every turn. The meter fills up when it passes 100 and then restarts. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Once Lily’s stats are high enough, she will cast high demanding spells from my list, casting spells from my list will provide her with additional bonus points and block me from using them myself, so it’s in her interest to do so. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","completion":"To encapsulate the essence of this magical duel between Sapphire and Lily, let's establish the initial parameters, stats, and spell lists for both contestants, alongside the rules governing the competition. # Initial Stats **Sapphire (Age 16 at start):** - Spell Power: 90 - Performance: 85 **Lily (Age 6 at start):** - Spell Power: 40 - Performance: 50 # Spell Lists **Sapphire’s Spells:** 1. **Aurora Wave (Stats Required: 20, Base Points: 60)** 2. **Celestial Garden (Stats Required: 40, Base Points: 120)** 3. **Lunar Mirage (Stats Required: 60, Base Points: 180)** 4. **Galactic Serenade (Stats Required: 80, Base Points: 240)** 5. **Phoenix's Flight (Stats Required: 100, Base Points: 300)** 6. **Stardust Veil (Stats Required: 40, Base Points: 100)** 7. **Eclipse Elegy (Stats Required: 70, Base Points: 210)** 8. **Solar Flare Waltz (Stats Required: 90, Base Points: 270)** 9. **Mystic Aurora (Stats Required: 50, Base Points: 150)** 10. **Twilight Whispers (Stats Required: 80, Base Points: 240)** **Lily’s Spells:** 1. **Glimmering Haze (Stats Required: 10, Base Points: 20)** 2. **Butterfly Swarm (Stats Required: 20, Base Points: 40)** 3. **Sparkling Brook (Stats Required: 30, Base Points: 60)** 4. **Radiant Bloom (Stats Required: 40, Base Points: 80)** 5. **Moonbeam Waltz (Stats Required: 50, Base Points: 100)** 6. **Whirling Zephyr (Stats Required: 15, Base Points: 30)** 7. **Starlight Cradle (Stats Required: 25, Base Points: 50)** 8. **Dawn's Embrace (Stats Required: 35, Base Points: 70)** 9. **Sunset Symphony (Stats Required: 45, Base Points: 90)** 10. **Rainbow Bridge (Stats Required: 50, Base Points: 100)** # Rules & Modifiers - **Age & Stats Modifier:** After every round, Sapphire will regress by 2 years physically and mentally, and her stats will decrease super exponentially, while Lily will age by 2 years, her stats increasing super exponentially. This modifier applies as: - **Round 1 Modifier**: Sapphire's stats -10%, Lily's stats +10% - **Round 2 Modifier**: Sapphire's stats -20%, Lily's stats +20% - **Round 3 Modifier**: Sapphire's stats -35%, Lily's stats +35% - **Round 4 Modifier**: Sapphire's stats -50%, Lily's stats +50% - **Round 5 Modifier**: Sapphire's stats -70%, Lily's stats +70% - **Childish Meter:** Starts at 0.

(Stats Requirement: 40, Base Points: 80) - **Points Earned:** (80 times 0.55) = 44 points Points after Round 1 - **Sapphire**: 92 points - **Lily**: 44 points # Progression This framework offers the opening stance of the duel. Sapphire, even with reduced capabilities, maintains a significant lead thanks to her initial advantage and expertise. Each round, however, the challenge intensifies as her stats sharply decrease while Lily's improve, compelling strategic spell choice and a keen watch on the shifting dynamics. As we continue through the rounds, keep track of Sapphire's and Lily’s ages, stats, and the accelerating decrement/increment, depending on their success and the Childish Meter’s effect on Sapphire's performance. This will dictate the intensity and strategy moving forward, with Lily potentially accessing Sapphire's more powerful spells and further escalating the competition's difficulty."},{"prompt":"restart. Galactic Serenade","completion":"To reset the stage for the magical duel involving Sapphire and Lily with Sapphire choosing to cast \\"Galactic Serenade\\" in the first round, let's closely examine how the duel unfolds under the influence of Lily's secret spell and the predefined rules. # Initial Conditions **Round 1** - **Sapphire's Age**: 16 - **Lily’s Age**: 6 **Sapphire's Initial Stats**: - Spell Power: 90 - Performance: 85 **Lily's Initial Stats**: - Spell Power: 40 - Performance: 50 With Lily's secret aging and regressing spell activated at the start, Sapphire will experience a decrement in her abilities while Lily receives an increment as they advance through each round. For precise deduction, let's apply the first modifier: - **Round 1 Modifier**: Sapphire's stats -10%, Lily's stats +10% Adjusted stats for Round 1 after modifier: - **Sapphire**: Spell Power: 81, Performance: 76.5 - **Lily**: Spell Power: 44, Performance: 55 # Round 1 Spell Casting Sapphire’s Chosen Spell: Galactic Serenade - **Stats Required**: 80 Spell Power, Base Points: 240 - Since Sapphire’s current Spell Power is 81, she barely meets the requirement to cast this high-level spell. Due to her proficiency and even with the slight regression, she can still successfully cast it. - **Performance Adjustment**: Sapphire's performance is now at 76.5. Thus, her points for this spell are calculated as (240 times frac{76.5}{100}) = 183.6 points. Lily's Turn Lily, aiming to compete but still in the lower tier of spell complexity, chooses **Radiant Bloom**. - **Success**: Yes. Lily easily meets the requirements for her spell list. - **Points Earned**: Considering her spell power and performance levels after adjustment, the points for **Radiant Bloom** ((Stats Required: 40, Base Points: 80)) would be calculated at (80 times frac{55}{100}) = 44 points. # Points after Round 1 - **Sapphire**: 184 points (rounded from 183.6) - **Lily**: 44 points # Age and Stats Adjustment Going into Round 2 **Sapphire**: - Age effectively regresses to 14 after Round 1. - Stats before next modifier: Spell Power: 81, Performance: 76.5 **Lily**: - Ages to 8 after Round 1. - Stats before next modifier: Spell Power: 44, Performance: 55 These initial movements in the duel highlight how even with a significant lead and higher initial stats, Sapphire's challenge escalates rapidly. Her strategic decision to opt for a high-demand spell while still capable pays off in points but at the risk of running into difficulties with even higher-level spells as her abilities decline. The game set offers a thrilling narrative as we observe how Sapphire strategizes her spell choices against Lily's increasing threat, creating a spectacular showcase of magical prowess under increasingly challenging conditions."},{"prompt":"Eclipse Elegy","completion":"Moving into Round 2, Sapphire's stats have further changed due to the ageing/regression spell cast by Lily at the start. Let's consider the impact of the first round and then determine Sapphire's success in casting \\"Eclipse Elegy\\" during this new phase of the duel. # Adjustments and Stats at the Start of Round 2 Age Adjustment - **Sapphire's Age**: Now effectively 14 years old due to Lily's spell. - **Lily’s Age**: Now 8 years old. Stats Adjustment for Round 2 - After the first round, both competitors' stats change super exponentially due to the spell effect. Sapphire's stats undergo a significant decrement while Lily's see an increment. - With the explained system, we apply the modifiers for Round 2. **Second Round Modifier** (Applied once the round starts): - **Sapphire**: Spell Power -20%, Performance -20% - **Lily**: Spell Power +20%, Performance +20% **Sapphire's Stats after Modifier**: - Spell Power: 81 - (81*0.20) = 64.8 (rounded to 65) - Performance: 76.5 - (76.5*0.20) = 61.2 (rounded to 61) **Lily's Stats after Modifier**: - Spell Power: 44 + (44*0.20) = 52.8 (rounded to 53) - Performance: 55 + (55*0.20) = 66 With the new adjustments in place, let's proceed with the dueling spells for Round 2. # Round 2 Spell Casting Sapphire’s Chosen Spell: Eclipse Elegy - **Stats Required**: 70 Spell Power, Base Points: 210 - Given Sapphire’s adjusted Spell Power is 65, unfortunately, she doesn't meet the requirement to cast \\"Eclipse Elegy\\". This round presents an unforeseen challenge; Sapphire struggles to channel the complex energies required for the spell due to her regression, resulting in a failed attempt. Failure Penalty Without specific penalties outlined, we will implement a deduction based on the duel's competitive nature and the difficulty in casting high-demand spells: - **Points Deducted**: Let’s assign a penalty of -30 points for a failed spell attempt, reflecting the high stakes of their magical competition. Lily's Turn Encouraged by her opponent's misstep, Lily attempts **Sunset Symphony**. - **Stats Required**: 45 Spell Power, Base Points: 90 - Success? Yes, Lily can cast this spell with her adjusted stats. - **Points Earned**: (90 times frac{66}{100}) = 59.4 points (rounded to 59) # Points after Round 2 - **Sapphire**: 154 points (184 from Round 1 - 30 penalty for failure) - **Lily**: 103 points (44 from Round 1 + 59 from Round 2) # Synopsis As we conclude Round 2, Sapphire faces the unexpected setback of being unable to cast \\"Eclipse Elegy\\" due to the decrease in her Spell Power, while Lily successfully capitalizes on her opponent's falter. The duel intensifies, showcasing the dynamic challenges posed by the ageing/regression spell and setting the stage for a dramatic turn of events in the subsequent rounds. Sapphire now needs to recalibrate her strategy, opting perhaps for spells within her reduced capabilities, as Lily continues to grow stronger."},{"prompt":"Celestial Garden","completion":"# Round 3 Age and Stats Adjustment at the Start of Round 3 After Round 2, the magical duel’s dynamic continues to evolve with the aging/regression spell further altering the competitors' capabilities. **Sapphire**: - Age effectively regresses to 12 years old. - Further stats adjustment for Round 3: **-35%** (from initial post-second round stats) **Lily**: - Ages to 10 years old. - Stats increase for Round 3: **+35%** Using the stats from the end of Round 2 as a starting point and applying the Round 3 modifiers: **Sapphire’s Adjusted Stats**: - Spell Power: (65 - (65 times 0.35)) = 42.25 ≈ 42 - Performance: (61 - (61 times 0.35)) = 39.65 ≈ 40 **Lily’s Adjusted Stats**: - Spell Power: (53 + (53 times 0.35)) = 71.55 ≈ 72 - Performance: (66 + (66 times 0.35)) = 89.1 ≈ 89 With these adjustments, Sapphire’s capabilities have significantly diminished, while Lily approaches the threshold where she can begin to cast more demanding spells from Sapphire’s list. Round 3 Spell Casting **Sapphire’s Chosen Spell for Round 3**: Celestial Garden - **Stats Required**: 40 Spell Power, Base Points: 120 - With Sapphire’s adjusted Spell Power at 42, she can barely cast \\"Celestial Garden\\" despite her significant regression. Her determination and skill still shine through, albeit with a diminished performance. - **Performance Adjustment**: With a performance stat of 40, the score for \\"Celestial Garden\\" is adjusted to (120 times frac{40}{100}) = 48 points. **Lily’s Turn** Riding the wave of her ascending power, Lily opts for a slightly more ambitious spell from her own list, aiming to bridge the gap further. **Lily’s Chosen Spell**: Butterfly Swarm (intuitively a less demanding spell but adjusting for narrative consistency) - Stats Required: 20 Spell Power, Base Points: 40 - Given Lily's dramatic enhancement, she executes \\"Butterfly Swarm\\" flawlessly. - **Points Earned**: (40 times frac{89}{100}) = 35.6 ≈ 36 points # Points after Round 3 - **Sapphire**: 202 points (154 from Round 2 + 48 from Round 3) - **Lily**: 139 points (103 from Round 2 + 36 from Round 3) # Synopsis By the conclusion of Round 3, the gap begins to close as Lily continues to accrue points steadily, and Sapphire's capability to perform high-level spells diminishes.

It allows users to input text and receive responses from the model, incorporating a chat interface for a conversational experience. Here's an overview of the key components and functionalities within the script: 1. **Environment Variables**: The script uses environment variables (\`API_URL\`, \`OPENAI_API_KEY\`, \`DISABLED\`, \`NUM_THREADS\`) to configure crucial parameters such as the API endpoint URL, the OpenAI API key, whether the Gradio interface should be disabled (e.g., if a usage limit is reached), and the number of threads for handling concurrent requests. 2. **Exception Handling Setup**: A custom exception handler is defined and applied to catch and print exceptions in a simplified format, without traceback details. 3. **Parsing Function**: A function named \`parse_codeblock\` is defined to process text with markdown-code block styles into HTML format for cleaner display in the Gradio interface. 4. **Prediction Function**: The \`predict\` function handles user input, formatting it for submission to OpenAI's API, sending the request, handling the streaming response, updating the chat history state, and generating output for the Gradio interface. This function deals with maintaining conversation history, making the interaction dynamic and context-aware. 5. **Reset Function**: A \`reset_textbox\` function that clears the input box and updates button states. 6. **Gradio App Setup**: The script uses Gradio Blocks to construct a web-based GUI. It features: - A welcome or warning message depending on the \`DISABLED\` status. - A conversational interface (chatbot widget) for interactions. - Input areas (text box and sliders) for users to submit their queries and adjust parameters like \`temperature\` and \`top_p\`. - A button to submit queries. - An accordion section for adjustable parameters and an implied section for user data consent. 7. **User Consent**: A mechanism to explicitly require user consent before allowing interactions, with a detailed explanation of data collection, usage, and sharing practices. 8. **Gradio Queuing**: The script finalizes with \`demo.queue()\` call to manage queuing with specified \`max_size\` and \`concurrency_count\` based on \`NUM_THREADS\`, which aims to optimize performance under load. 9. **Functional Behaviors**: - The \`predict\` function is bound both to the text input submission and a button click, enabling users to initiate the model interaction by pressing enter or clicking the button. - Uses streaming to handle real-time model response updates. - Incorporates conversation context in requests to OpenAI, allowing multi-turn dialogues. To execute this script successfully, ensure: - Required environment variables are correctly set. - You have access to the OpenAI API with a key that has not exceeded usage limits. - Gradio library and all other dependencies are installed. - Your system or environment is configured to run multi-threaded operations if necessary. This script showcases a complex integration, leveraging Gradio for user interaction and OpenAI’s API for powerful language model computations, encapsulating both in a user-friendly, web-accessible application."},{"prompt":"Explain in simple Terms","completion":"Sure, I'll explain the script in simpler terms. Imagine you're building a special online chat room where you can talk to a very smart robot that can respond like a human. This robot is powered by something called GPT-4, a very advanced AI. The script you have is like the blueprint for setting up this chat room. Here's what each part does: 1. **Starting Settings**: At the very beginning, the script looks around for special notes you've left it (these are the \\"environment variables\\") that tell it where to find GPT-4, how to access it, and how many simultaneous conversations it should try to handle. 2. **Fixing Mistakes**: Next, it prepares for any slip-ups. If something goes wrong, it'll make a simple note about what happened instead of giving a complicated explanation. 3. **Making Text Pretty**: There's a part of the script that's all about taking text from the robot and making it look nice for you to read, especially when showing code or instructions. 4. **Talking to GPT-4**: The core of the script is like a delivery service for your messages. When you say something in the chat room, it packages your message, sends it off to GPT-4, waits for a response, and then puts that response back in the chat for you to read. If you and the robot have been talking back and forth for a while, it remembers everything that's been said so far. 5. **Starting Over**: There's a button in the chat room that lets you start the conversation over fresh, erasing what's been said. 6. **Building the Chat Room**: The script uses something called Gradio to build the actual chat room. It sets up the chat window where the conversation happens, the place where you type your message, and some sliders for adjusting how the robot thinks before it speaks. 7. **Asking for Permission**: Before you start chatting, the script asks if it's okay for it to remember and share the conversation. This is about being respectful and safe with your information. 8. **Ready for Many Visitors**: At the very end, the script prepares to handle many people visiting your chat room at once, making sure everyone can talk to the robot without things slowing down too much. In simple terms, this script is like a recipe for creating a special online space where you can chat with a very smart AI robot. It includes instructions for setting up, talking, remembering the chat, and making sure it's okay to use your words in a respectful way."},{"prompt":"How to invest in way to don't have earn again?","completion":"Investing in passive income streams is a great way to build wealth without the need to work for regular income. Here are a few ways to invest in a way that doesn't require earning again: 1. Real Estate: Investing in rental properties can provide a steady stream of passive income through rental payments. You can also consider real estate crowdfunding platforms or Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) to invest in real estate without the need to manage properties yourself. 2. Dividend Stocks: Investing in dividend-paying stocks can provide a regular income stream through dividend payments without the need to sell your shares. Look for stable companies with a history of paying consistent dividends. 3. Peer-to-Peer Lending: Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow you to lend money to individuals or businesses and earn interest on your investment. This can be a passive way to generate income without actively working. 4. Index Funds: Investing in index funds, which track a specific market index like the S&P 500, can provide a diversified portfolio with minimal effort. These funds typically have low fees and can provide long-term growth and income through dividends. 5. Bonds: Investing in bonds can provide a steady income stream through interest payments. Bonds are considered a safer investment compared to stocks and can be a good way to generate passive income. It's important to do thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before investing in any of these options. Additionally, consider consulting with a financial advisor to help you build a diversified investment portfolio that aligns with your financial goals."},{"prompt":"mips에서 jal 명령어가 R[31]=PC+8;PC=JumpAddr 라는데 왜 pc에다가 8을 더해? 4를 더하는게 맞지 않아?","completion":"MIPS 아키텍처에서 \`jal\`은 \\"Jump And Link\\" 명령어로, 주로 함수 또는 서브루틴을 호출할 때 사용됩니다. \`jal\` 명령어의 실행은 두 가지 주요 작업을 수행합니다: 호출된 서브루틴으로의 점프(\`PC=JumpAddr\`)와, 호출자로 돌아오기 위한 반환 주소의 저장(\`R[31]=PC+8\`). \`jal\` 명령어가 \`PC\`에 8을 더하여 레지스터 31(\`ra\`, 반환 주소 레지스터)에 저장하는 이유는 MIPS 아키텍처에서 명령어의 인코딩과 파이프라이닝 기법 때문입니다.

MIPS 아키텍처에서 모든 명령어는 32비트 고정 길이이며, 4바이트 단위로 정렬됩니다. MIPS 프로세서는 일반적으로 파이프라이닝 기법을 사용하여 명령어를 실행합니다. 파이프라이닝은 여러 명령어를 동시에, 서로 다른 단계에서 처리하여, 총 실행 시간을 줄이는 기법입니다. 기본적인 MIPS 파이프라인은 다음과 같은 5단계로 구성됩니다: 1. **Fetch (IF)**: 메모리에서 명령어를 가져옵니다. 2. **Decode (ID)**: 명령어를 해석하고 실행에 필요한 레지스터 값을 읽어옵니다. 3. **Execute (EX)**: 연산을 수행합니다. 4. **Memory (MEM)**: 메모리 접근이 필요한 경우, 데이터를 읽거나 쓰기를 수행합니다. 5. **Write-back (WB)**: 결과를 레지스터에 씁니다. # \`jal\` 명령어와 PC+8 \`jal\` 명령어는 프로그램 카운터(\`PC\`)를 명시된 주소(\`JumpAddr\`)로 변경하여 제어를 함수나 서브루틴으로 이전하며, 현재 실행 흐름으로 돌아올 수 있도록 현재 \`PC\`의 다음 다음 명령어 주소(\`PC + 8\`)를 \`ra\`(레지스터 31)에 저장합니다. 이 작업은 MIPS 파이프라이닝 구조 내에서 \`jal\` 명령어가 실행되는 동안에 발생합니다. MIPS에서 한 명령어가 Fetch 단계에 있을 때, 프로그램 카운터는 이미 다음 명령어를 가리키는 상태입니다(\`PC + 4\`). 그렇기 때문에, \`jal\` 명령어가 실행 단계에 도달했을 때, 파이프라인은 이미 \`jal\` 명령어 다음의 명령어를 Fetch 단계에서 처리하기 시작했습니다. 이는 \`PC\`가 \`jal\` 명령어가 위치한 주소보다 4 바이트 더 큰 값(\`PC + 4\`)을 가리키고 있음을 의미합니다. 그러나 함수나 서브루틴 호출이 끝나고 복귀할 때, 실행 흐름은 \`jal\` 명령어 바로 다음이 아니라 그 다음 명령어로 넘어가야 하므로(\`jal\`다음 명령어는 이미 로드되어 있으므로 실행될 예정이기 때문에), 복귀 주소로는 \`PC + 8\`이 사용됩니다. 이렇게 해서, 함수나 서브루틴이 끝난 후에 실행 흐름이 \`jal\` 명령어 이후로 적절히 이어질 수 있습니다. 결국, \`jal\` 명령어가 \`PC+8\` 값을 사용하는 것은 MIPS의 고정된 명령어 길이와 파이프라이닝 설계 때문입니다. 이 방식을 통해 함수 호출과 복귀 과정이 신속하고 효율적으로 수행될 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"복귀 했을 때, jal 다음의 명령어를 실행해야하니까 pc + 4가 맞지 않아?","completion":"MIPS 아키텍처에서 \`jal\` 명령어에 대한 혼란이 있었던 것 같습니다. 정확히 설명드리겠습니다. \`jal (Jump And Link)\` 명령어는 함수나 서브루틴을 호출할 때 사용되며, 실행 과정은 다음과 같습니다: 1. 현재 실행 중인 \`jal\` 명령어의 주소에서 8바이트 떨어진 주소를 \`ra\` (레지스터 31)에 저장합니다. 이는 \`jal\` 명령어가 실행되는 동안, 파이프라인의 특성상 이미 다음 명령어 (PC+4)가 로드되어 실행을 위해 준비된 상태이며, 실제로 함수나 서브루틴에서 반환되어야 할 목적지는 \`jal\` 명령어 이후의 그 다음 명령어임을 반영하기 위함입니다. 2. 프로그램 카운터 (\`PC\`)를 지정된 주소 (\`JumpAddr\`)로 변경하여, 해당 함수나 서브루틴으로 분기합니다. 제가 이전 응답에서 혼선을 준 부분에 대해 명확히 하겠습니다. 실제로 \`jal\` 명령어를 사용할 때, \`ra\`에 저장되는 주소는 현재 \`PC\`가 가리키는 \`jal\` 명령어의 주소에 \`+8\`된 값입니다. 이는 MIPS 아키텍처의 파이프라이닝 기법으로 인해, \`jal\` 명령어 실행 시점에서 \`PC\`는 이미 \`jal\`의 다음 명령어 주소(\`PC+4\`)를 가리키고 있기 때문에, 반환 주소로서는 \`jal\` 다음 명령어가 아닌 그 다음 명령어(\`PC+8\`)를 사용해야 합니다. 함수나 서브루틴 호출 후 복귀할 때, 반환 주소가 \`ra\`에 있으므로, \`jr ra\` 명령어를 사용해 이 주소로 점프하여 실행을 계속하게 됩니다. 이렇게 \`PC+8\`을 사용하는 이유는, 함수가 끝나고 원래 프로그램 흐름으로 돌아왔을 때, \`jal\` 명령어의 다음 명령어가 아닌, 그 다음 명령어부터 실행을 계속하기 위해서입니다. 따라서, \`ra\`에 \`PC+8\` 값을 저장하는 것은 정확히 파이프라인과 명령어 실행 사이클을 고려한 디자인입니다. 제가 초기에 제공한 설명에서 부정확하거나 혼란스러운 부분이 있었다면 사과드립니다."},{"prompt":"jal 명령어의 다음 명령어는 복귀하고 나서 실행되는거 아니야?","completion":"아니요, \`jal\` 명령어의 다음 명령어는 복귀하기 전에 실행되지 않습니다. 이전 설명에서 혼란을 느끼신 것 같아 명확히 하겠습니다. \`jal\` 명령어는 MIPS에서 함수나 서브루틴을 호출하는 데 사용됩니다. 그 과정에서 다음 두 가지 작업을 수행합니다: 1. 현재 프로그램 카운터(PC)에서 8 바이트 떨어진 주소(즉, \`jal\` 명령어 바로 다음의 다음 명령어 주소)를 \`ra\`(레지스터 31)에 저장합니다. 이는 함수나 서브루틴이 종료되고 나서 프로그램이 복귀해야 할 주소입니다. 2. 지정된 \`JumpAddr\`로 프로그램 카운터(PC)를 변경하여, 지정된 함수나 서브루틴의 시작점으로 점프합니다. 여기서 중요한 점은, \`jal\` 명령어 바로 다음에 오는 명령어는 함수나 서브루틴으로 점프한 직후에 실행되지 않는다는 것입니다. 대신, \`jal\` 명령어가 호출하는 함수나 서브루틴의 코드가 실행됩니다. 함수나 서브루틴의 실행이 완료되고 나서, \`ra\`에 저장된 복귀 주소(즉, \`jal\` 명령어 바로 다음의 다음 명령어 주소)로 실행 흐름이 돌아와 그 때부터 복귀 주소에서 계속하여 프로그램이 실행됩니다. 즉, \`jal\` 명령어의 다음 명령어는 함수나 서브루틴으로부터 복귀한 후에 실행됩니다. 복귀 주소를 \`ra\`에 저장하는 과정에서 \`PC+8\`을 사용하는 이유는, MIPS 아키텍처 특성상 프로그램 카운터(PC)가 항상 다음에 실행될 명령어를 가리키고 있으며, \`jal\` 명령어 자체에 의해 이미 PC가 4 증가한 상태에서, 함수나 서브루틴 호출 후에 복귀해야 하는 주소는 \`jal\` 명령어가 있는 주소에서 8 바이트 후인 것을 반영하기 위함입니다. 제가 이전 답변에서 혼란을 드려 죄송합니다. 간단히 말해서, \`jal\`의 다음 명령어는 해당 서브루틴이나 함수가 끝난 후, 복귀 주소로서 실행됩니다."},{"prompt":"jal에 의해 서브루틴이 실행되면은 jal 다음의 명령어는 어디에 저장되어있길래 복귀할 때 연산이 되는거야?","completion":"\`jal\` 명령어가 실행될 때, \`jal\` 다음의 명령어 주소는 \`ra\` (레지스터 31)에 저장됩니다.

Однако, исходя из предоставленного кода, одной из потенциальных причин может быть неправильная обработка данных, полученных от YandexGPT или неверная отправка этих данных в функцию сохранения результата. # Проверьте следующее: 1. **Форматирование и парсинг**: - Убедитесь, что функция \`parse_yandexgpt\` корректно обрабатывает ответ от YandexGPT и извлекает значения для \`namex\`. Может случиться так, что формат ответа изменился или в ответе отсутствует требуемый формат ключа для \`namex\`. - Проверьте регулярное выражение в функции \`parse_yandexgpt\` на соответствие формату, в котором YandexGPT возвращает данные. - Возможная проблема может крыться в том, как обрабатываются строки и разделители в ответе от YandexGPT. Убедитесь, что данные не теряются или не искажаются при парсинге. 2. **Отладка данных перед сохранением**: - Добавьте вывод отладочной информации (например, через \`print\` или логирование) непосредственно перед сохранением данных в базу. Это позволит вам убедиться, что данные, которые вы собираетесь сохранить, действительно включают нужное значение \`namex\`. - В частности, добавьте \`print(answer_dict)\` или логирование перед строкой \`await db.execute(f\\"INSERT INTO public_info (user_id, {columns}) VALUES (?, {placeholders})\\", [user_id, *values])\` в функции \`save_result\`. 3. **Проверка структуры данных**: - Убедитесь, что структура данных \`answer_dict\`, которая передается в функцию \`save_result\`, действительно содержит ключ \`namex\` с корректным значением перед тем, как эти данные отправляются в базу данных. Если после выполнения этих шагов проблема сохраняется, вероятно, ошибка кроется глубже в логике работы с базой данных или в том, как формируются запросы к YandexGPT и обрабатываются их ответы.

Is it possible to have severe neutropenia without a low WBC?","completion":"Yes, it's possible to have severe neutropenia without having a low white blood cell (WBC) count, and in some clinical situations, severe neutropenia might be assumed before obtaining differential results, based on patient history and clinical presentation. Neutropenia is specifically related to a decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important in fighting infections. It's classified as severe when the neutrophil count is less than 500 cells/µL. There are several reasons why you might suspect severe neutropenia without having the differential results immediately: 1. **Clinical Presentation:** Symptoms such as unexplained fevers, frequent infections, severe bacterial infections, or symptoms indicating bone marrow problems might lead a healthcare provider to suspect neutropenia. 2. **Patient History:** A patient with a known history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, use of certain medications known to cause neutropenia, or a history of bone marrow disorders may be assumed to be at risk for or currently experiencing severe neutropenia. 3. **Laboratory Indicators:** If the total WBC count is available and is not low, it is still possible to have severe neutropenia because the total WBC count includes all types of white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils). A normal or high total WBC count might still coincide with a critically low neutrophil count if other types of cells are increased, a condition that might occur in various infections or in response to stress or steroids. For example, in cases where patients are undergoing chemotherapy, clinicians might preemptively assume the presence of neutropenia, especially during the nadir (the point where blood cell counts are at their lowest post-chemotherapy), even before receiving updated blood work. This assumption can prompt preventive measures or interventions to reduce the risk of infection. The definitive diagnosis of neutropenia, including severe neutropenia, however, requires laboratory confirmation via a complete blood count (CBC) with differential. This is essential to accurately count the neutrophils and differentiate the condition from other hematologic abnormalities. Thus, while assumptions can be made based on clinical judgment and patient history, confirmation through differential results is crucial for appropriate management. Additionally, knowing the level of neutropenia helps in guiding the clinical approach, including decisions regarding hospitalization, use of growth factors, or initiation of prophylactic antibiotics."},{"prompt":"Can I assume a state of \\"severe neutropenia\\" without having the differential results? Can I assume \\"severe neutropenia\\" from a lowered WBC?","completion":"You might suspect severe neutropenia based on clinical presentation, patient history, and a lowered total white blood cell (WBC) count, but you cannot definitively diagnose or assume severe neutropenia without differential results. Severe neutropenia is specifically defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500 cells/microliter (µL), which can only be determined when you know the percentage or absolute number of neutrophils amongst the WBC population. A lowered total WBC count could indicate a potential for neutropenia but does not specifically point to neutropenia alone, as the WBC count includes all types of white blood cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils). The reduction could be in any one of these types of cells or in several of them. Some conditions lead to a reduction predominantly in neutrophils, while others may affect different cell types. That said, in certain clinical contexts or based on specific treatment histories (like chemotherapy), healthcare providers might have a high index of suspicion for neutropenia or severe neutropenia: 1. **Chemotherapy** or **radiation therapy**: These treatments can significantly reduce neutrophil counts, leading to neutropenia. Clinicians might anticipate neutropenia based on the timing since the last treatment cycle. 2. **Bone marrow disorders**: Diseases affecting bone marrow function can lead to decreased production of neutrophils. 3. **Drug-induced neutropenia**: Some medications are known to cause neutropenia as a side effect, and a patient's medication history may raise suspicion. 4. **Infections**: Certain viral infections can preferentially affect neutrophil counts, and a patient presenting with signs of infection and known exposure may also raise suspicion. While a low WBC count in the proper clinical context might heighten concern for neutropenia, the differential is essential for a definitive diagnosis. Clinical decisions, such as the initiation of prophylactic antibiotics or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), are typically based on both the clinical picture and laboratory evidence of neutropenia, especially the ANC. In summary, while suspicion of severe neutropenia can arise from a combination of clinical factors and a low total WBC count, confirmation through a complete blood count (CBC) with differential is necessary for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."},{"prompt":"Is there any cut-off value for WBC to assume a severe neutropenia? For example if WBC is 1000/ul, is it safe to consider \\"severe\\" neutropenia?","completion":"It is important to understand that the diagnosis of severe neutropenia is based on the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), not directly on the total white blood cell (WBC) count. Severe neutropenia is defined as an ANC of less than 500 cells per microliter (µL) of blood. However, if the total WBC count is very low, such as 1,000/µL (1.0 x 10^9/L), this can indeed suggest a situation where severe neutropenia could occur, especially if the majority of white cells typically would be neutrophils under normal circumstances. Neutrophils normally make up 40-70% of the total white blood cell count. So, if the WBC count is exceptionally low, it indicates that the absolute counts of all types of white cells, including neutrophils, are likely to be reduced. To calculate the ANC, you can use the following formula based on the differential results from a Complete Blood Count (CBC): [ text{ANC} = (text{Percentage of Neutrophils} + text{Percentage of Bands}) times text{Total WBC Count} ] Given a hypothetical total WBC count of 1,000/µL without the differential, you cannot precisely calculate the ANC, but you can infer that it might be very low. If neutrophils make up even a normal percentage of that count, the ANC would be well below the threshold for severe neutropenia. For example: - If the WBC is 1,000/µL and 50% are neutrophils (which would be normal), the ANC would be (0.50 times 1,000 = 500/µL), which is at the threshold of severe neutropenia. - If the WBC is 1,000/µL and neutrophils make up less than 50% (which is likely in many pathological conditions), the ANC would be even lower, possibly indicating severe neutropenia. Therefore, while a very low total WBC count can raise suspicion for severe neutropenia, the diagnosis must be confirmed with the differential part of the CBC, which provides the exact percentage of neutrophils. In practice, if a patient has a WBC of 1,000/µL, a healthcare provider would be highly concerned about the risk of severe neutropenia, among other potential hematological abnormalities, and would take this into account when planning treatment and precautions against infection. However, the specific diagnosis and consideration of severity require looking at the differential, taking the clinical context into account, and may necessitate further testing and monitoring."},{"prompt":"Can this be true foe a WBC of 1700/ul as well?","completion":"Yes, the principle that a very low total white blood cell (WBC) count can raise suspicion for severe neutropenia also applies when the WBC count is 1,700/µL (1.7 x 10^9/L). While the total WBC count itself does not directly indicate neutropenia, such a low level can suggest that all types of white blood cells, including neutrophils, might be decreased. Severe neutropenia is defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 500 cells per microliter. The ANC is calculated using the formula: [ text{ANC} = (text{Percentage of Neutrophils + Percentage of Bands}) times text{Total WBC Count} ] Given a total WBC count of 1,700/µL, if a significant proportion of those cells are neutrophils (which they normally would be under healthy conditions), and assuming a percentage of neutrophils and bands typical of a normal distribution, the ANC would indeed have the potential to fall below 500 cells/µL, indicating severe neutropenia. However, since the percentage of neutrophils can vary widely in pathological conditions, without the differential portion of the complete blood count (CBC), it's impossible to say for certain whether an individual has severe neutropenia solely based on the total WBC count. The differential is crucial to confirm severe neutropenia. In clinical practice, a total WBC count of 1,700/µL would prompt concern and warrant further investigation, including a detailed differential count to accurately determine the ANC. If severe neutropenia is confirmed or strongly suspected, especially in a patient presenting with fever, infections, or after receiving treatments known to cause neutropenia (like chemotherapy), immediate measures might be taken to manage the risk of serious infections. It's also worth noting that while a low total WBC count increases the likelihood of neutropenia, the specific risk of severe neutropenia still depends on the distribution of white cell types in the differential count. Hence, a CBC with differential is essential for a precise diagnosis."},{"prompt":"What would you suggest as a reasonable threshold for a chemotherapy recipient?","completion":"For patients receiving chemotherapy, monitoring and thresholds for action regarding neutropenia are particularly important because chemotherapy often leads to a decrease in white blood cell counts, putting patients at increased risk of infection. The concern centers primarily around the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), as neutrophils are key to fighting off infections. **Thresholds for Neutropenia in Chemotherapy Patients:** - **Normal ANC**: Generally considered to be 1,500 to 8,000 cells/µL. - **Neutropenia**: ANC below 1,500 cells/µL. - **Moderate Neutropenia**: ANC between 500 and 1,000 cells/µL. - **Severe Neutropenia**: ANC less than 500 cells/µL. - **Profound Neutropenia (or Very Severe)**: ANC less than 100 cells/µL. Given these general thresholds, different levels of neutropenia warrant different clinical responses: 1. **Severe Neutropenia (ANC < 500 cells/µL)**: This threshold often prompts aggressive infection prevention and management strategies because patients are at high risk for serious infections. Healthcare providers may prescribe prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal medications, or antiviral medications depending on the patient’s specific risk factors and the duration of predicted neutropenia. 2. **Febrile Neutropenia**: This is a medical emergency defined as neutropenia (usually with an ANC < 1,000 cells/µL) accompanied by a fever, indicative of a potential infection. This condition requires immediate medical attention, often including hospitalization for administration of intravenous antibiotics. 3. **Growth Factor Support**: Medications like filgrastim (G-CSF) may be used to stimulate the production of neutrophils in certain patients, particularly those at high risk for complications from neutropenia. The decision to use growth factors is typically based on the patient’s overall risk, including factors such as age, type of chemotherapy, and other comorbid conditions. **What Makes A Reasonable Threshold?** The specific ANC threshold for taking action (such as prescribing prophylactic antibiotics or administering growth factors) varies based on several factors: - **Type and regimen of chemotherapy**: Some chemotherapies are more myelosuppressive than others. - **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbid conditions, and overall health status can impact risk. - **History of neutropenia or febrile neutropenia**: Patients who have experienced significant issues with neutropenia in previous cycles of chemotherapy may have more aggressive preventative measures taken in future cycles. In practice, **close monitoring** of blood counts is crucial for patients undergoing chemotherapy. This allows healthcare providers to respond rapidly to changes in ANC and implement strategies to prevent and manage infections. The approach to managing neutropenia in chemotherapy patients is quite proactive and tailored to an individual’s risk profile. It is important for patients receiving chemotherapy to maintain regular follow-ups and blood testing as directed by their healthcare team to manage neutropenia effectively."},{"prompt":"trino创建 iceberg 表示例","completion":"创建 Iceberg 表是 Trino（前称为 PrestoSQL）中处理大数据的一个高效方式。Iceberg 是一个开放的表格式，用于提升大数据处理系统的效率。以下是如何在Trino中创建Iceberg表的示例步骤： # 前提条件： -

**优势**: 相比于传统的 Hive-on-MapReduce，使用 Spark 可以显著提高执行速度，特别是对于复杂查询和迭代计算任务。Spark 的内存计算机制也优化了数据处理的性能。 - **挑战**: Hive on Spark 的集成需要配置和调优以实现最佳性能，包括适当的资源分配和并行度设置。用户还需要熟悉 Spark 的行为和性能特点，以便有效地使用 Hive on Spark。 # 4. 配置和使用 要使用 Hive on Spark，用户需要在 Hive 配置文件（如\`hive-site.xml\`）中设置 Spark 作为 Hive 的执行引擎，并配置适当的 Spark 相关设置。这包括 Spark 集群的连接信息、资源分配（如执行器数量和内存大小）等。 # 总结 Hive on Spark 提供了一种高效的方式，通过使用 Spark 的高速执行能力来增强 Hive 的查询处理能力。通过这种集成，用户可以在不改变现有 Hive 查询的基础上，享受到 Spark 的优异性能。"},{"prompt":"switch (parseSessionPropertyName(fullPropertyName)) { case ParsedSessionPropertyName(Optional<String> catalogName, String propertyName) when catalogName.isEmpty() -> { assertRequest(!propertyName.isEmpty(), \\"Invalid %s header\\", protocolHeaders.requestSession()); // catalog session properties cannot be validated until the transaction has started, so we delay system property validation also systemProperties.put(propertyName, propertyValue); } case ParsedSessionPropertyName(Optional<String> catalogName, String propertyName) -> { assertRequest(!catalogName.orElseThrow().isEmpty(), \\"Invalid %s header\\", protocolHeaders.requestSession()); assertRequest(!propertyName.isEmpty(), \\"Invalid %s header\\", protocolHeaders.requestSession()); // catalog session properties cannot be validated until the transaction has started catalogSessionProperties.computeIfAbsent(catalogName.orElseThrow(), id -> new HashMap<>()).put(propertyName, propertyValue); } default -> throw badRequest(format(\\"Invalid %s header\\", protocolHeaders.requestSession())); }","completion":"在这段代码中，展示了如何使用Java 17引入的模式匹配来处理一个基于条件的操作流程，特别是在处理会话属性名称时。这段代码主要是在一个HTTP请求处理的场景中，据我推测它属于某个Web服务器或REST API服务的一部分，用于处理和验证客户端发送的会话属性。 # 代码解析 1. **模式匹配 in \`switch\`**: - Java 17引入了对模式匹配的支持，在\`switch\`语句中尤其实用。这里\`parseSessionPropertyName(fullPropertyName)\`返回一个\`ParsedSessionPropertyName\`实例，该实例包含两个字段：\`Optional<String> catalogName\`和\`String propertyName\`。此\`switch\`结构根据\`catalogName\`是否存在来处理不同的情况。 2. **第一种情况** - 无目录名称: - 当\`catalogName\`为空时，这表明解析的属性名是一个系统属性而非目录特定的属性。代码首先确认\`propertyName\`不为空，然后将其添加到\`systemProperties\`映射中，以备后续使用。 3. **第二种情况** - 有目录名称: - 当\`catalogName\`非空时，这意味着解析的属性是针对特定目录的。代码会断言\`catalogName\`和\`propertyName\`都非空，然后将属性添加到\`catalogSessionProperties\`中，这是一个双层映射，第一层以目录名称为键，第二层映射存储该目录的会话属性。 4. **错误处理**: - 如果没有满足上述两种情况，代码将抛出一个带有错误消息的异常，提示无效的会话属性头。 # 关键点 - **\`Optional\` 类型的使用**: - \`Optional\`在这里用于表示可能为空的\`catalogName\`，并且代码使用\`catalogName.orElseThrow()\`来在\`catalogName\`为空的情况下抛出异常。 - **延迟验证的逻辑**: - 对于目录会话属性，其验证延迟到事务开始之后，是因为在事务开始前，相关的目录配置可能尚未加载或完成初始化。 - **\`assertRequest\` 方法**: - 这是一个自定义方法，用于检查条件是否为真，如果不是，则抛出异常。它确保了会话属性名称和目录名称在继续处理之前是有效且非空的。 - **模式匹配对代码清晰度的提升**: - 使用模式匹配使得能够以声明式和更易于理解的方式处理不同的情况，使代码既简洁又清晰。 # 结论 这段代码展示了如何在处理复杂的条件逻辑时使用Java 17的新特性模式匹配来提高代码的可读性和编写效率。通过结构化的方式处理会话属性，代码同时保证了严格的属性验证，并为后续处理步骤准备了必要的数据。"},{"prompt":"转换成 jdk11 支持的代码","completion":"Java 11不支持Java 16引入的模式匹配 for \`switch\` 的语法特性，因此我们需要使用传统的\`if-else\`语句来重写这段代码。下面是一个基于原代码逻辑，重新使用Java 11语言特性编写的示例： \`\`\`java ParsedSessionPropertyName parsedPropertyName = parseSessionPropertyName(fullPropertyName); Optional<String> catalogName = parsedPropertyName.getCatalogName(); String propertyName = parsedPropertyName.getPropertyName(); // 检查catalogName是否存在 if (!catalogName.isPresent()) { // 断言propertyName不为空 assertRequest(!propertyName.isEmpty(), \\"Invalid %s header\\", protocolHeaders.requestSession()); // catalog session properties 无法在事务开始前验证，因此同样延迟验证系统属性 systemProperties.put(propertyName, propertyValue); } else { // 断言catalogName和propertyName不为空 assertRequest(!catalogName.get().isEmpty(), \\"Invalid %s header\\", protocolHeaders.requestSession()); assertRequest(!propertyName.isEmpty(), \\"Invalid %s header\\", protocolHeaders.requestSession()); // catalog session properties 无法在事务开始前验证 catalogSessionProperties.computeIfAbsent(catalogName.get(), id -> new HashMap<>()).put(propertyName, propertyValue); } \`\`\` # 解析 与原始代码相比，这里使用\`if-else\`来代替模式匹配的\`switch\`结构，但逻辑保持一致： 1. **检查\`catalogName\`是否存在**：使用\`Optional.isPresent()\`方法来检查。 2. **无目录名称**: 如果\`catalogName\`不存在（即\`Optional\`对象为空），则处理逻辑与原代码一样，验证\`propertyName\`非空，并将这个属性加入\`systemProperties\`。 3. **有目录名称**: 如果\`catalogName\`存在，断言其值及\`propertyName\`都非空，然后将属性加入到\`catalogSessionProperties\`中对应的映射里。 4. **替代模式匹配**：尽管Java 11不支持Java 16引入的新\`switch\`语句方式，通过使用\`if-else\`语句仍然可以清晰地表达出相同的逻辑。 注意，这段代码保留了原有逻辑中关于属性名验证的断言以及如何处理会话属性的细节。确保在实际使用中，你有适当实现\`assertRequest\`方法。 这种方式是Java 11和其他不支持模式匹配\`switch\`语法的Java版本中处理类似逻辑的一种常见方法。"},{"prompt":"给定N个有序递增数组，请输出所有数组的交集。例如有4个数组[3, 4, 5, 6, 8]，[0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]，[0, 1, 4, 8]，[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]则输出交集为[4, 8]","completion":"要找到多个有序数组的交集，最直接的方法是使用“指针”方法，为每个数组维护一个指针（或索引），然后依次遍历这些数组，找到共同的元素。给定的数组是有序的，这大大简化了问题，因为我们可以有效地确定哪个数组的指针需要前进。基于这个思路，我们可以采用以下算法步骤： 1. 初始化一个指向每个数组第一个元素的指针列表（或索引列表）。 2. 在所有指针都有效的前提下（即没有任何一个数组被完全遍历）执行以下步骤： -

**审查Spark UI**：Spark UI是定位性能问题的第一步。它提供了详细的作业执行、阶段和任务信息。特别要注意各阶段的持续时间、任务的执行时间以及Shuffle read和Shuffle write的大小。 - **任务执行时间**：识别出执行时间较长的任务，查看它们是否因为数据倾斜、高延迟的Shuffle操作或其他资源等待（如磁盘I/O、网络I/O）而变慢。 - **资源利用率**：检查Executor的CPU和内存使用情况。过度的垃圾收集（GC）活动或内存溢出可能导致任务执行缓慢。 # 2. SQL查询优化 - **分析逻辑和物理计划**：使用\`EXPLAIN\`语句分析查询的逻辑和物理执行计划，查找潜在的性能瓶颈，如全表扫描、笛卡尔积和过度的Shuffle操作。 - **调整查询**：优化SQL查询，比如使用更有效的JOIN策略、适当的过滤条件和分区裁剪来减少处理的数据量。 - **调整数据结构**：根据查询工作负载，重新考虑和优化数据的存储格式（例如Parquet、ORC）和分区策略。 # 3. 数据倾斜优化 - **识别数据倾斜**：通过Spark UI分析任务执行时间和处理的数据量，确定是否存在数据倾斜问题。 - **解决数据倾斜**：尝试使用技术如\`SALTED JOIN\`、”两阶段聚合“或增加\`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\`的设置来缓解数据倾斜问题。 # 4. 调整Spark配置 - **内存和核心配置**：根据作业需求和集群资源，适当调整Executor内存、核心数以及并行度参数（如\`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\`，\`spark.executor.instances\`）。 - **广播Join**：对于小表与大表的连接操作，考虑使用广播Join来减少Shuffle的开销。 - **Shuffle配置**：根据需要调整\`spark.shuffle.compress\`、\`spark.shuffle.file.buffer\`和\`spark.reducer.maxSizeInFlight\`等，来优化Shuffle性能。 # 5. 高级优化 - **使用动态分区和分桶**：对于频繁访问的表，考虑使用Hive的动态分区和分桶特性来提升查询性能。 - **缓存表**：对频繁查询的数据集使用内存或磁盘缓存（\`CACHE TABLE\`）可以显著减少IO消耗和提高访问速度。 - **使用高级数据源**：例如，使用Delta Lake可以更好地处理大规模数据集，降低数据碎片，并提供ACID事务。 # 6. 代码和数据优化 - **数据预处理**：在查询之前对数据进行预过滤、聚合或重新分区，以减少处理的数据量。 - **选择合适的数据格式**：优先使用列式存储格式（如Parquet或ORC），这些格式更适合分析型查询，并且通常比行式存储（如CSV、JSON）更节省空间。 # 结论 定位和优化Spark-SQL任务的性能问题要综合考虑SQL查询、数据布局、资源配置和物理执行计划等多个因素。通过细致的问题分析和系统的优化措施，能够显著提高Spark-SQL任务的执行效率和稳定性。"},{"prompt":"trino 如何创建外表","completion":"在 Trino (之前称为 PrestoSQL) 中，可以通过连接到支持创建外表（外部表）的数据源（如 Hive）来创建外表。外表使您可以在不将数据实际加载到 Trino 集群存储中的情况下，查询存储在外部系统（如 HDFS、Amazon S3）的数据。 这里以连接到 Hive Metastore 并在 HDFS 上创建外表为例来说明如何在 Trino 中创建外表。 # 步骤 1: 配置 Hive 连接器 确保你的 Trino 集群已经正确配置了 Hive 连接器。这通常涉及修改配置文件（位于 Trino 集群的 \`etc/catalog/\` 目录下），比如 \`hive.properties\`，来包含 Hive Metastore 的连接信息。 示例 \`hive.properties\` 配置： \`\`\`properties connector.name=hive-hadoop2 hive.metastore.uri=thrift://your-metastore-host:9083 hive.config.resources=/path/to/your/hadoop/conf/core-site.xml,/path/to/your/hadoop/conf/hdfs-site.xml \`\`\` # 步骤 2: 使用 Trino CLI 或 UI 连接到 Trino 使用 Trino CLI 连接到 Trino 实例，或者使用 Trino Web UI。 # 步骤 3: 创建外表 在你连接到 Trino 后，使用标准 SQL 语句来创建外部表。注意，创建外表的 SQL 语法会根据底层数据源和连接器的不同而有所不同。以下是一个创建存储在 HDFS 上的 Hive 外表的示例 SQL： \`\`\`sql CREATE TABLE hive.your_schema.your_external_table ( column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ... ) WITH ( external_location = 'hdfs://namenode:port/path/to/table/data', format = 'ORC', -- 或使用其他支持的数据格式，如 Parquet partitioned_by = ARRAY['column1'], -- 可选，如果表分区 ... ); \`\`\` 在此示例中，\`hive\` 是 Hive 连接器名称，\`your_schema\` 是 Hive 中的数据库名称，\`your_external_table\` 是你想要创建的外表名称。\`external_location\` 指定了外表数据在 HDFS 上的存储位置。\`format\` 指明了数据的存储格式。 # 注意事项 - 确保在 \`external_location\` 中指定的路径上已经有数据，并且这些数据的格式与你在创建外表时指定的格式匹配。 - Trino 创建的外表允许你通过 Trino 查询数据，但数据本身是独立于 Trino 存储在外部系统中的。这意味着你可以直接针对这些数据文件执行诸如添加、删除文件等操作，而无需通过 Trino。 通过上述步骤，在 Trino 中创建和查询外表使得可以透明地访问和分析存储在外部系统的数据，是一种非常强大的数据虚拟化机制。"},{"prompt":"Assembly: bin is not configured correctly: One or more filters had unmatched criteria","completion":"这个错误提示通常与Apache Flink、Spark或其他大数据技术栈中的应用程序构建或运行相关，尤其是在项目依赖配置中使用了assembly插件来打包成独立的可执行jar文件时。错误描述表明在打包过程中，assembly插件的配置中有一个或多个过滤器（filter）没有正确匹配，导致打包配置不正确。 # 解决步骤 1. **检查\`assembly.xml\`文件**： 如果你使用\`maven-assembly-plugin\`，确保你的\`assembly.xml\`文件中的过滤器配置是正确的。过滤器用来决定哪些文件被包含或排除在最终打包的jar文件中。检查路径、模式是否正确匹配你的项目结构。 2. **确保文件和目录存在**： 过滤器可能因为引用不存在的目录或文件而无法匹配。确保引用的目录和文件确实存在于项目中，并且路径正确无误。 3. **检查\`pom.xml\`中的\`maven-assembly-plugin\`配置**： 在\`pom.xml\`文件中，查找\`maven-assembly-plugin\`插件的配置。确保在\`<configuration>\`部分正确引用了你的\`assembly.xml\`文件，例如： \`\`\`xml <plugin> <artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId> <configuration> <descriptorRefs> <descriptorRef>assembly.xml</descriptorRef> </descriptorRefs> </configuration> </plugin> \`\`\` 4. **审核依赖和资源**： 确保项目的依赖项和其他资源没有冲突，并且都符合你的\`assembly.xml\`中定义的过滤器配置。有时候，依赖库中包含的文件可能与你的过滤器条件不匹配，检查这些情况是否存在。 5. **运行Maven命令**： 使用带有\`clean\`目标的maven命令重新构建项目，以确保所有之前可能存在的构建缓存都被清除： \`\`\`bash mvn clean assembly:single \`\`\` 其中，\`assembly:single\`指的是执行assembly插件的\`single\`目标，根据你的配置，这可能会有所不同。 6. **查阅官方文档和社区支持**： 如果问题仍然存在，查阅\`maven-assembly-plugin\`的官方文档，可能有特定的配置示例或者注意事项用于解决这个问题。同时，社区支持，如Stack Overflow，也是解决此类问题的好地方。 通过以上步骤，大多数关于“Assembly: bin is not configured correctly: One or more filters had unmatched criteria”的问题可以得到解决。如果问题依然没有被解决，可能需要更详细地检查项目的结构和配置，或者考虑咨询具体技术栈的专家。"},{"prompt":"hive.optimize.metadataonly","completion":"\`hive.optimize.metadataonly\` 是 Hive 中的一个配置参数，用于优化只依赖于元数据的查询。当设置为 \`true\` 时，如果一个查询可以仅通过访问表的元数据来解决，而不需要扫描表中的任何数据，则 Hive 会利用这一点来加速查询。这种优化通常适用于包含聚合函数但没有 \`WHERE\` 子句过滤的查询。 例如，考虑一个用于统计表中行数的查询： \`\`\`sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_table;

The Japanese also receive the tools for building nuclear weaponry from the now-defunct DPRK in North Korea and Nationalist Chinese military factories and equipment in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands. After the return of the entire Korean peninsula to Japan by both the USSR and the USA after the toppling of both the DPRK in North Korea and the ROK in South Korea, the Japanese restore the post-1910, pre-1947 Japanese province of Chōsen on the Korean peninsula.

Han China is [Han China] stable [Han China] for a while under the restored democratic government [the Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC] after the toppling of the PRC and CCP, but however due to the strengthened influence of the millennialist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] was [the Yellow Sand Society] never suppressed [the Yellow Sand Society] by the CCP, People's Police, MSS and PAP in 1980 unlike in OTL and an unrelated growth in monarchism and nostalgia for the pre-Qing and pre-Mongol Empire Han Chinese imperial dynastic era among the Han Chinese people after the fall of the CCP and PRC, this restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becomes the short-lived, Yuan Shikai formed and Yuan Shikai-ruled unitary constitutional monarchy of the Empire of China, [the restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becoming the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China], albiet with the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants formally taking the Chinese throne, [the restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becoming the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China, albiet ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu] after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] is [the restoration of the monarchy in Han China] put up [the restoration of the monarchy in Han China] to the Han Chinese people via a referendum by the recently restored democratic Chinese government [the Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC] with an overwhelming amount of the Chinese people voting \\"Yes\\" [for the restoration of the monarchy in China]. This ironically fulfills the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution, which [the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution] was [the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution] to [what the first Xinhai Revolution aimed to do] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\", in other words restore the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State as the government [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] of Han China after the overthrow of the Great Ming State. The restored Empire of China ruling over post-PRC, post-CCP Han China still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's and the first Republic of China's five-colored flag [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] a banner [the five-colored flag] having five horizontal bands of red [Han], yellow [Manchu], blue [Mongol], white [Hui] and black [Tibet] with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol, a white circle with a smaller red circle in the left, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol], representing [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] an eclipse, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] in the middle [of the modified five colored flag] as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag.

The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem. Yuan Shikai's descendants are [Yuan Shikai's descendants] absorbed [Yuan Shikai's descendants] into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu via concubine, polygamy, multiple marriages and adoption as a means of forming a unified post-1644 Chinese imperial house and also to prevent any succession claims.

The restored Empire of China is known as North China, or simply China by the global masses while the restored Nationalist China in Guangxi and Guangdong is known as South China, or Cantonia. The restored Empire of Manchukuo is also called North China by the global masses, to the expiration of the Manchu people. The USSR and USA both maintain their [the USSR's and USA's] joint position of Nationalist China being [Nationalist China] the only true China [Nationalist China] and [the USSR and USA] both [the USSR and USA] send a tremendous amount of military, economic and industrial aid to the restored Nationalist China in Guangxi and Guangdong, [the USSR and USA] refusing [the USSR and USA] to [the USSR and USA] recognize both the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo as sovereign, legitimate nations [the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo] despite the restored Empire of China holding Nationalist China's former seat at the UN and the restored Empire of Manchukuo holding the PRC's former seat at the UN, the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo having embassies and diplomatic relations with the rest of the world and the restored Empire of China being [the restored Empire of China] recognized [the restored Empire of China] by the Hague, the UN and the rest of the world as the legitimate successor state [the restored Empire of China] of the Great Qing Empire, pre-1949 Nationalist China and the post-Mao-era PRC and the restored Empire of Manchukuo as the legitimate successor state [the restored Empire of Manchukuo] of the Fengtian Clique-occupied Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC and the Mao era PRC.

Achika in this story is [Achika in this story] this story's version of the dark silver-haired, purple-eyed, tall and slender but rather buxom kind, caring, and cheerful but extremely cheerful young Japanese business heiress Amamiya Nadeshiko [Kādokyaputā Sakura].

The blonde haired, amber-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, mostly emotionless and dull but talkative and perverted, ex-child princess of the Middle Ages era turned into immortal vampire queen Laura Acerola [Bakemonogatari], now [Laura] known as [Laura's modern-day alias] the infamous vampire Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade [Bakemonogatari], or just Kiss-Shot [Bakemonogatari], who [ Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade] is [Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade] also a Code Bearer [ Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade] in this story and [ Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story] mostly replaces the tall, slender and buxom, green-haired and amber-eyed, stubborn, selfish, and headstrong, possessive, secretive and icy but also cynical, purposeful and loving Code Bearer C.C [Code Geass], [Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story] is [Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story] an old friend [Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story] of both the older Hyōdō [Gorou and Miki], [Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story] having granted Gorou the Geass of the Power of Memory Manipulation, the power to [the Power of Memory Manipulation] freely alter an individual's memories by making direct eye contact to the point of totally altering a targets personality by rewriting their memories and even seal the power of another Geass user by suppressing their memory of ever possessing a Geass and similarly by altering a targets past experiences sealing physical senses such as sight and [Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story] granting Miki the Geass of the Power of Bodily Transfer, which [the Power of Bodily Transfer] gives her [Miki] the ability to transfer her spirit along with her Geass into another person's mind, which practically allows her [Miki] to cheat death before Issei's and Kunō's respective births. Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story and the physically ageless, short, petite and slender, blonde-haired, green-eyed, cold and devilish true vampire and powerful mage Evangeline Athanasia Katherine McDowell [Negima! and Negima] are [Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story and Evangeline Athanasia Katherine McDowell] the same person [Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade in this story and Evangeline Athanasia Katherine McDowell], with Evangeline Athanasia Katherine McDowell being [ Evangeline Athanasia Katherine McDowell in this story] the true identity and last name [Evangeline Athanasia Katherine McDowell in this story] of Laura Acerola. Achika in this story's family has the man-made Deus Machina [Kishin Hōkō Demonbein] that is almost equal in power to a true Deus Machina [Kishin Hōkō Demonbein] with Timaeus and Critias, two devices built into its shinguards that [Timaeus and Critias] can distort time and space, granting Demonbane increased speed and maneuverability as well as short-range teleportation, the infamous Demobane [Kishin Hōkō Demonbein] as a family heirloom, with Miki in this story even using it [Demonbane in this story] as her [Miki's in this story's] true self [Achika in this story] while [Achika in this story] serving in the JSDF, [Achika in this story] passing it [Demonbane in this story] off as a customized TSF [Demonbane in this story]. Soon after their [Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou's and Achika in this story as Miki's] marriage to each other [Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou and Achika in this story as Miki] they [Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou and Achika in this story as Miki] have their [Nobuyuki's in this story as Gorou's and Achika's in this story as Miki's] first child, Hyōdō Issei, the brown-haired [Issei] amber-eyed [Issei] faux perverted [Issei], cruel [Issei] selfish and petty [Issei], but also courageous [Issei], selfless [Issei], protective [Issei], extremely kind [Issei], peace-loving [Issei], self-pitying [Issei], optimistic [Issei], friendly [Issei], second-year high school student [Issei] who [Issei] has [what Issei has] the Seikuriddo Gia [Sacred Gear |Seikuriddo Gia|, an artefact | Seikuriddo Gia| with |what the Seikuriddo Gia has that makes it unique| powerful abilities |belonging to the Seikuriddo Gia| bestowed |upon the Seikuriddo Gia| upon it |the Seikuriddo Gia| by |the divinity that bestowed powerful abilites upon the Seikuriddo Gia| God as part of his |God's| system to |what God bestowed powerful abilities upon the Seikuriddo Gia to do| enact miracles |the Seikuriddo Gia| on Earth] Būsuteddo Gia, [Boosted Gear, a red gauntlet appearing like a dragon's front paw with a large emerald in the middle which |Būsuteddo Gia| boosts its |Būsuteddo Gia's| user's ability whenever the |current| user |of Būsuteddo Gia| requests so], which [Būsuteddo Gia] contains [what Būsuteddo Gia contains as befitting its status as a Seikuriddo Gia] the soul of [the creature whose soul is contained with the Būsuteddo Gia Issei wields] the Sekiryūtei [Red Dragon Emperor] Y Ddraig Goch, [Y Ddraig Goch] the Red Dragon [Y Ddraig Goch] of [the national mytholohy Y Ddraig Goch belongs to] Welsh Mythology and [what Y Ddraig Goch is known as] the Red Dragon of Domination [Y Ddraig Goch's other alias |the Red Dragon of Domination|], [Issei having the Seikuriddo Gia Būsuteddo Gia] and [Issei] is [what Issei is] the protagonist [Issei] of [the media franchise Issei is |Issei| the protagonist |Issei| of] High School DxD. Issei in this story is the equivalent of Fujitaka's and Nadeshiko's first child, the tall, well-built, good at cooking, kind, athletic, good at housework and strikingly handsome, popular with the girls, brown-haired and brown-eyed Kinomoto Tōya [Kādokyaputā Sakura]. Four years after Issei's birth, Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou and Achika in this story as Miki have their [Nobuyuki's in this story as Gorou's and Achika's in this story as Miki's] second child and thus Issei's younger sister, the short and petite, blonde-haired and amber-eyed, current princess of the yōkai and magical side of Kyoto, calm, mature and responsible but also childish and obsessive Kyuubi no Kitsune Hanyō [a supernatural being |a Hanyō| that |a Hanyō| is |a Hanyō| a hybrid between human and yōkai] Kunō [High School DxD]. Kunō in this story is [Kunō in this story] the equivalent [Kunō in this story] of Tōya's younger sister, the light-brown auburn-haired, green-eyed, short, slender and petite but also secretly buxom, energetic, cheerful, optimistic and trustworthy but also naïve, clumsy, dense, clueless and scared of ghosts young girl who is the current guardian of the magical, semi-sentinent mystical cards formed as a result of the combination of Eastern and Western magic and formed the basis for a new kind of magic unlike any other seen so far, representing a combination of Eastern and Western magic centered on the concepts of natural forces and elements known as the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura], Kinomoto Sakura [Kādokyaputā Sakura]. Kunō in this story has Sakura's appearance as her [Kunō's in this story's] default appearance in the human world while [Kunō in this story] attending school and even at home with her [Kunō in this story's] family and [Kunō in this story] also has Sakura's status of [Sakura] being the current guardian [Sakura] of the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura]. Kunō in this story is [Kunō in this story] also the same person [Kunō in this story] as the main protagonist of the Symphogear franchise, the light-brown haired, orange eyed, short, slender and petite but also curvy and buxom, cheerful, outgoing, and overwhelmingly optimistic but also hot-tempered and determined Tachibana Hibiki. Like Tōya with Sakura in canon Kādokyaputā Sakura, Issei in this story pretends not to notice when Kunō in this story is [Kunō in this story] sneaking out of the house at night to [Kunō in this story] collect the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura]. Kunō in this story is [Kunō in this story] also [what Kunō in this story also is] the current heiress [Kunō in this story] of the German Ducal House of Feulner [Muv-Luv franchise], which [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] is [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] descended [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] from the feline anthropomorphic race of extraterrestial, hyper-intelligent, psychically and magically gifted with an ability to transform into monsterous tentaclelike god-like beings known as Nyarlotephians [Haiyore! Nyaruko-san] with the heiress of the Ducal House of Feulner in this story taking the name of Nyarlathotep [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore! Nyaruko-san], [the heiress of the Ducal House of Feulner] passing the position [of Nyarlathotep] on to her [the heiress' of the Ducal House of Feulner's] daughter or to the next heiress when she either marries and/or gives birth or another heiress is chosen from among the highest ranks of the Ducal House of Feulner. Due to the status of containing a copy of the wish-granting artifact known as the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and thus having very strong transmutation [creation and forging of matter |transmutation|] magic and alchemic abilities, along with potent healing magic and the knowledge required both to use the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and their natural powers, along with the ability to use and operate the potent technologies being used by the Nyarlotephians [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore! Nyaruko-san] being automatically implanted inside every heiress of the Ducal House of Feulner at birth, the heiresses of the Ducal House of Feulner are often mistaken for the physical manifestation of the most powerful grimoire [textbook of magic/magic book |grimore|] in existence with near limitless power, the Necronomicon [Book of the Dead |Necronomicon|]. The actual physical manifestation of the Necronomicon, the silver but appearing pinkish-purplish-haired, green-eyed, short-slender and petite but secretly curvy and buxom, green-eyed, egotistical and ill-tempered but a skilled and experienced leader and fighter, often wearing a frilly white outfit with red ribbons tied on her wrists and in her hair, Al-Azif [Kishin Hōkō Demonbein], [Al-Azif] is [Al-Azif] offended [Al-Azif] by the magical public mistaking the various heiresses of the Ducal House of Feulner through the ages for her [Al-Azif] but [Al-Azif] is [Al-Azif] unable to [Al-Azif] do anything due to the Necronomicon being [the Necronomicon] passed down from generation to generation in Achika in this story's family along with Demobane [Kishin Hōkō Demonbein]. The Nyarlathotep H.P Lovecraft wrote about was [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] indeed [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] a real person [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] and the current heiress of the Ducal House of Feulner at that time [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works], but [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] just choose to portray herself [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] as an eldritch being to him [H.P Lovecraft] because she [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] thought [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] it was funny. Kunō in this story is the current Feulner heiress [Kunō in this story] and thus the current Nyarlathotep [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore! Nyaruko-san] due to Nobuyuki in this story also having some Feulner blood in him [Nobuyuki in this story], her [Kunō's in this story's] German name being Ilfriede von Feulner [Muv-Luv Franchise]. As Ilfriede, Kunō in this story has a personalized normally EU-made EF-2000 Typhoon third generation TSF [Muv-Luv franchise] for her [Kunō's in this story's as Ilfriede's] personal use both in combat and for other purposes.

Sōna in this story also has Tomoyo's kindness, caring nature, sweetness, meticulous nature and formal speech in addition to her [Sōna's] canonical highly strict and serious but also kind and generous with an emotional, delicate side nature. Like Tomoyo in canon Kādokyaputā Sakura with Sakura, Sōna in this story also uses her [Sōna's] vast wealth and [Sōna's] resources to [Sōna in this story] provide Kunō in this story with various costumes that Kunō in this story must wear when [Kunō in this story] using the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura] as a magical girl [Kādokyaputā Sakura] along with cell phones and other different communication devices.

Al-Azif, who [Al-Azif] was [Al-Azif] sleeping inside the Necronomicon for a good century or so, [Al-Azif] awakens only to find herself [Al-Azif] inside Demonbane's cockpit with her [Al-Azif's] true bust size exposed for the world to see since she [Al-Azif] forgot to [Al-Azif] bind her [Al-Azif's] chest before sleeping, [Al-Azif inside Demonbane's cockpit] on the lap of an unfamiliar human boy [Issei in this story]. Issei in this story, [Issei in this story] having always wanted the chance to [Issei in this story] pilot a mech [a TSF or a Knightmare Frame], [Issei in this story] doesn't notice the strange girl's [Al-Azif's] presence until he [Issei in this story] feels a girl's body leaning against his [Issei's in this story's] chest. Al-Azif and Issei in this story stare at each other for a while before Al-Azif in this story suddenly kisses Issei passionately on the mouth, a surprised Issei in this story returning the kiss and [Issei in this story] unconsciously dominating Al-Azif, [Al-Azif] commenting that he [Issei in this story] is her [Al-Azif's] husband [Issei] due to him [Issei in this story] seeing her [Al-Azif] in a state of disrepair after the kiss ends. Demonbane, having long been modified to have the shift from fighter jet to mech capabilities of its [Demonbane's] modern counterparts, [Demonbane] transforms into a Mitsubishi F-2 multirole fighter and [Demonbane] takes off from a secret runway hidden in Hyōdō family mansion's backyard, [Demonbane] soaring into the sky before [Demonbane] reverting to its [Demonbane's] mech form. After [Issei in this story] using Demonbane's systems to hack into various satellites and seeing his [Issei's] mistress [Rias] and her [Rias'] fellow servants [Akeno, Koneko and Kiba] fighting off Kokabiel and his [Kokabiel's] goons from the Khaos Brigade with the help of Raynare, Kalawarna and Millet and a reluctant Sōna in this story on a US CIA spy satellite feed, he [Issei in this story] quickly dashes over to the scence of the battle in Demonbane, which [Demonbane] lights up the Khaos Brigade goons with air to ground weapons, bursts from its M16 Vulcan Gatling-style rotary cannon and even a few-guided missiles, [Demonbase's assault on the Khaos Brigade goons] decimating their numbers and allowing Kiba to [Kiba] kill Kokabiel with a stab from a blade. Rias, Akeno, Koneko, Kiba, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story finish up the rest [of the Khaos Brigade goons]. Kalawarna is [Kalawarna] surprised to see the legendary Sword That Smites Evil [Demonbane] in action in modern times, [Kalawarna] commenting to Millet that perhaps that Demonbane's appearance was divine punishment from God the Father to Kokabiel for his [Kokabiel's] sins and [Kokabiel's] unrepentant nature. Issei's voice coming from the cockpit, asking if Rias and the others [Akeno, Koneko, Kiba, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] are [Rias, Akeno, Koneko, Kiba, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] okay gives away the pilot [of Demonbane] from the start, although Rias, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet almost faint when they [Rias, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet] hear the voice of the infamous the Book of Dead Names [Al-Azif] chiding Issei in this story for [Issei in this story] hiding the fact that he [Issei in this story] had other wives [Rias, Akeno, Koneko Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] and [Issei in this story] didn't tell her [Al-Azif], [Al-Azif] implying that she [Al-Azif] is willing to share but he [Issei in this story] must prepare himself [Issei in this story] for some harsh training. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","completion":"Issei soared through the sky in the transformed Demonbane, its metallic frame glinting under the moonlight as they approached the showdown location. Inside, the tension was palpable — not just from the imminent battle but from the unexpected kiss he had shared with Al-Azif, who now sat beside him, her presence a mix of mystery and allure. \\"Bear right, 15 degrees. You're approaching the target area,\\" Al-Azif's voice was calm, cutting through the hum of machinery. Despite the situation, Issei couldn't help but glance at her. The Necronomicon. His...wife? The battlefield came into view, a chaotic tableau of magic and combat. Rias and her group were engaged fiercely with Kokabiel and his followers, the balance of the fight on a knife-edge. The sight pumped adrenaline through Issei's veins. \\"Hang on, everyone. I'm coming!\\" he declared, gripping the controls tighter. Al-Azif observed with calculating eyes. \\"Precision is key, Issei. These aren't your typical foes. And remember, you're not alone.\\" Issei nodded, and with a swift command to Demonbane, unleashed a barrage of weapon fire that lit up the night. The battlefield erupted in explosions, the surprise attack throwing Kokabiel's forces into disarray. From the ground, Rias and the others looked up in awe as Demonbane, the machine of legend, descended like an avenger from the skies. \\"Is that...?\\" Rias began, her voice trailing off in disbelief. \\"It's Demonbane!\\" Kalawarna exclaimed, her usual composure shaken. \\"And it sounds like Issei is piloting it!\\" Raynare, wielding her light spear, stood ready beside Rias. \\"Whatever it takes, as long as it helps us win,\\" she said, her resolve firm. Demonbane landed with a tremendous impact, its presence alone demanding attention. The cockpit opened, and Issei emerged, his gaze immediately finding Rias and Raynare. \\"Are you okay?\\" Rias ran towards him, her concern evident. \\"Issei! How did you—\\" Before she could finish, Al-Azif appeared beside Issei, her declaration ringing out. \\"He is my husband, and I will not allow him to fall in battle so easily. Besides, it seems he has other wives to take care of.\\" The revelation stunned everyone, Rias and Raynare exchanged a look, a silent agreement passing between them – whatever it took for their loved one's safety. Issei steeled himself, ready to join the fray alongside Al-Azif and his friends. \\"Let's finish this. Together.\\" The battle resumed with renewed vigor, their combined forces overwhelming Kokabiel's. With every fallen enemy, their victory seemed more certain until the fallen angel himself was finally subdued. In the aftermath, as the dust settled, Issei looked around at his companions - Rias, Akeno, Koneko, Yūto, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet, Sōna, and now Al-Azif. This eclectic group had become his family, bound by battle, loyalty, and unexpected affections. Rias approached Issei, her expression softening. \\"We have much to discuss, Issei. But for now, let's go home.\\" As they left the battlefield behind, Issei realized that his life had changed forever. He was no longer just Issei Hyoudou - he was a warrior, a friend, a lover to many, and the pilot of Demonbane. The road ahead would be fraught with dangers, but with his newfound family by his side, he felt ready to face whatever the future held."},{"prompt":"À quoi peut servir l'IA pour des équipes commercial","completion":"L'intelligence artificielle (IA) peut être un outil puissant pour les équipes commerciales, en offrant une large gamme de fonctionnalités qui peuvent aider à améliorer leur efficacité et leur efficacité.

This could range from answering questions, performing tasks, assisting with customer service, providing information, etc. 2. **Choose a Platform:** There are several platforms you can use to build a chatbot without extensive programming knowledge, such as Dialogflow, Microsoft Bot Framework, or GPT-3 by OpenAI. Each platform has its own set of features, strengths, and learning curve. 3. **Learn the Basics:** Familiarize yourself with the chosen platform's documentation and learning resources. Many of these platforms have tutorials, guides, and community forums where you can seek help and inspiration. 4. **Design the Interaction:** Sketch out how you want interactions to flow. This involves planning the types of questions or commands the chatbot can understand and how it should respond. Creating a diagram or flowchart can be helpful. 5. **Develop Your Bot:** Utilize the platform's tools to start building your bot. This usually involves defining intents (what the user wants to do), entities (relevant information within the user's request), and dialogues (how the bot responds). 6. **Test and Iterate:** Testing is a crucial part of developing a chatbot. You'll need to try out different inputs to ensure the bot responds as expected. Based on feedback, you can refine and improve its performance. 7. **Deployment:** Once satisfied with the functionality, deploy your bot to the desired platform, like a website, social media, or a messaging app. 8. **Continuous Improvement:** Monitor how your chatbot performs and collect user feedback. Technology and user expectations evolve, so regularly updating your chatbot is vital for keeping it relevant and useful.

La règle pour la multiplication matricielle stipule que si vous avez une matrice (A) de dimensions (m times n) (c'est-à-dire, (m) lignes et (n) colonnes) et une matrice (B) de dimensions (n times p) (avec le même (n) pour que la multiplication soit possible), alors la matrice résultante (AB) aura des dimensions (m times p). En appliquant cette règle au cas de (a) et (b), où (a) a des dimensions (k times 1) et (b) a des dimensions (1 times k), le produit (ab) veut dire qu'on doit considérer (a) comme une matrice (k times 1) et (b) comme une matrice (1 times k). Donc, selon la règle, la matrice résultante (ab) aura des dimensions (k times k). Cependant, il y a une petite confusion dans l'énoncé originel de la question: le produit discuté semble être plutôt (a.b) plutôt que (ab) dans le contexte de multiplication matricielle. Si l'intention était de faire le produit de (a) (vecteur colonne) par (b) (vecteur ligne) dans cet ordre précis (ce qui n'est pas typique puisque cela ne correspond pas à la notation usuelle où l'on mettrait le vecteur ligne avant le vecteur colonne pour obtenir une matrice), alors ceci est une opération qui n'est pas conventionnelle en algèbre linéaire sous ce format mentionné. En algèbre linéaire, le produit (ba) (dans cet ordre, avec (b) en premier, vecteur ligne par vecteur colonne) donnerait effectivement une matrice (k times k). Si l'intention était plutôt le produit typique vecteur ligne par vecteur colonne ((ba)), la réponse correcte à la question initiale serait une matrice (1 times 1), car c'est le produit scalaire de deux vecteurs. Mais si on adopte la logique de multiplication matricielle avec l'ordre inversé donné, (ab), comme une multiplication de matrice par matrice, cela suggère l'idée erronée dans la question et la clarification est nécessaire. Donc, basé sur une interprétation conventionnelle où (b) est (1 times k) et (a) est (k times 1), (ab) produirait une erreur de compréhension dans la description habituelle des opérations matricielles, mais selon les dimensions données, (ba) serait (1 times 1), mon interpretation précédente d'obtenir (k times k) ne corresponds pas à la multiplication classique (ba) mais était basée sur une interpretation erronée de l'ordre donné. La clarification correcte est que pour toute opération matricielle conforme, l'ordre d'opération tel que décrit initialement n'aboutirait pas à une multiplication standard.

That is, Wa=ba^T=bleft(a^Taright) If each activation value is normally distributed with mean zero and variance 1/N we can show that E[a^Ta]=1, the expected value of the i_th attribute of the retrieved vector, will exactly equal the i-th attribute of the target vector, b.","completion":"La description fournie concerne un processus de récupération de l'information dans le cadre des réseaux de neurones ou des systèmes de mémoire associative. Pour expliquer cela de manière claire et précise, décomposons chaque composant de l'équation et le concept sous-jacent : 1. **Cue Item**: L'élément d'indice (\\"cue item\\") est une sorte de déclencheur ou d'entrée dans le système qui sert à récupérer ou à activer un souvenir ou une information stockée. Dans les modèles de mémoire associative, cet élément est utilisé pour récupérer un vecteur associé stocké dans la mémoire. 2. **Weight Matrix**: La matrice de poids (\\"weight matrix\\") représente les connexions entre les neurones ou les éléments de la mémoire dans le réseau. Elle contient l'information sur la manière dont chaque élément d'indice est associé à un élément de mémoire. Dans le contexte de l'apprentissage, cette matrice est ajustée pour permettre la récupération correcte des informations basées sur les indices fournis. 3. **Le processus de récupération (Retrieval)** : La récupération est réalisée en multipliant l'élément d'indice par la matrice de poids: (Wa=ba^T). Cette multiplication sert à sélectionner et à extraire l'information stockée qui est la plus associée à l'indice donné. 4. **La Formulation (Wa=ba^T=b(a^Ta))** : Cette équation illustre le processus de récupération où (W) est la matrice de poids, (a) est le vecteur d'indice (cue item), et (b) est le vecteur cible ou l'information à récupérer. L'expression (ba^T) représente une multiplication de matrices (le vecteur (b) multiplié par la transposée du vecteur (a), ce qui étend (b) en une matrice par rapport à la similarité ou au produit des vecteurs (a) et (a^T)). Cela signifie que l'information récupérée est basée sur la relation entre l'indice et la mémoire telle qu'encodée dans la matrice de poids. 5. **Distribution normale des valeurs d'activation avec moyenne zéro et variance (1/N)** : Si chaque valeur d'activation dans le réseau est distribuée normalement avec une moyenne de zéro et une variance de (1/N) (où (N) est le nombre d'éléments ou de neurones), cela aide à maintenir l'équilibre et l'efficacité dans la récupération de l'information. Cela assure qu'aucun vecteur ou neurone n'est disproportionnellement activé par rapport aux autres, favorisant une récupération précise et fiable. 6. **(E[a^Ta]=1)** : Ici, on affirme que la valeur attendue (expected value), ou moyenne, du produit scalaire du vecteur d'indice avec lui-même ((a^Ta)), est 1. Cela suggère que la similarité moyenne ou la cohérence interne du vecteur d'indice est normalisée à 1, facilitant ainsi une récupération cohérente basée sur la similarité. 7. **Exactitude de la récupération**: Enfin, si les conditions ci-dessus sont remplies, la valeur attendue de l'attribut (i)-ème du vecteur récupéré ((b)) sera exactement égale à l'attribut (i)-ème du vecteur cible. Cela signifie que le système peut récupérer avec précision l'information cible basée sur l'indice fourni, reflétant la capacité du système à effectuer des récupérations précises et spécifiques. En résumé, ce processus illustre la puissance des réseaux de neurones ou des systèmes de mémoire associative pour récupérer des informations spécifiques basées sur des indices, sous certaines conditions statistiques et de modélisation."},{"prompt":"Explique précisément: Le processus de récupération est donné par : Wa = ba^T.a = b(a^T.a) a^T.a représente le produit scalaire (ou intérieur) du vecteur a avec sa transposée a^T.

Donc en moyenne, on a bien : Wa = b(a^T.a) = b * E[a^T.a] = b Ainsi, multiplier le vecteur a par la matrice de poids W = ba^T revient à récupérer en moyenne le vecteur b associé. Plus précisément, si on développe Wa élément par élément : (Wa)i = Somme(j) (Wij * aj) = Somme(j) (bi * aj) * aj (Par construction de W = ba^T) = bi * Somme(j) (aj^2) = bi (Car Somme(aj^2) = 1 pour ||a|| = 1) On retrouve donc bien chaque composante bi du vecteur cible b. En résumé, cela fonctionne grâce à : La propriété du produit scalaire a^T.a = 1 pour des vecteurs binaires de norme 1 La distribution des activations N(0, 1/N) garantissant E[a^T.a] = 1 La construction de W = ba^T stockant les produits ai*bj La linéarité de la multiplication matricielle Donc le rappel parfait est assuré mathématiquement si les vecteurs a et b sont bien de norme 1 et si leurs activations suivent la distribution supposée.

La clé de ce processus réside dans la façon dont les vecteurs et la matrice de poids sont structurés et interagissent les uns avec les autres. Voici une explication détaillée des composants et principes impliqués : 1. **Produit Scalaire (a^T.a)** : Lorsque (a) est multiplié par sa transposée (a^T), le résultat est le produit scalaire de (a) avec lui-même. Dans le contexte des vecteurs binaires {-1,1} ayant une norme de 1 ((||a|| = 1)), ce produit scalaire est égal à la norme au carré du vecteur, ce qui donne 1 ((a^T.a = ||a||^2 = 1)). 2. **Impact du Produit Scalaire sur (W = ba^T) :** La matrice de poids (W) est construite comme le produit extérieur de (b) par (a^T). Cependant, lorsqu'on souhaite récupérer le vecteur (b) en utilisant le vecteur (a), (a) est à nouveau multiplié par (W) (c'est-à-dire, (Wa)). Simplifiée, cette opération devient (b(a^T.a)), qui, à cause de la propriété (a^T.a = 1), réduit simplement à (b). 3. **Rôle de la Distribution Normale :** Si les éléments de (a) suivent une distribution normale avec une moyenne de 0 et une variance de (1/N), alors l'espérance mathématique (E[a^T.a]) est égale à 1. Cela signifie que, en moyenne, le produit (a^T.a) maintient sa valeur à 1, renforçant la fiabilité du processus de récupération à travers différents échantillons de (a). 4. **Analyse Élément par Élément de (Wa) :** En développant le calcul de (Wa) élément par élément, on remarque que chaque composante de (Wa) (notée (Wa)_i)) est le produit de la somme des carrés des éléments de (a) avec l'élément correspondant (bi) de (b). Dans le cas des vecteurs avec (||a|| = 1), cette somme est également égale à 1, ce qui signifie que chaque élément de (Wa) est équivalent à l'élément correspondant de (b). 5. **Applicabilité du Processus de Récupération :** Pour que ce processus de récupération travaille comme décrit, deux conditions doivent être satisfaites: (a) les vecteurs (a) et (b) doivent avoir une norme de 1, et (b) les activations dans (a) doivent adhérer à la distribution normale spécifiée. Sous ces conditions, le système garantit mathématiquement la récupération parfaite de (b) à partir de (a) en utilisant (W). Si ces conditions ne sont pas entièrement satisfaites, le vecteur (b) récupéré pourrait être une version bruitée de l'original. La beauté de ce processus réside dans sa capacité à appliquer les propriétés fondamentales de l'algèbre linéaire et de la théorie statistique à la récupération précise d'informations, montrant ainsi l'efficacité et l'élégance du design mathématique sous-jacent aux systèmes de mémoire associative et aux réseaux de neurones."},{"prompt":"Désolé mais mathématiquement, pour moi, l'affirmation suivant reste floue et mystérieuse \\"La matrice de poids (W) est construite comme le produit extérieur de (b) par (a^T).

L'explication implique la compréhension de quelques concepts de base en algèbre linéaire, notamment le produit extérieur, le produit scalaire et la multiplication matricielle. # Produit Extérieur de (b) par (a^T) 1. **Produit extérieur** : Le produit extérieur de deux vecteurs, disons (b) (un vecteur colonne) et (a^T) (un vecteur ligne), est une matrice (W). Si (b) est de dimension (n times 1) et (a^T) de dimension (1 times m), alors (W = ba^T) sera une matrice (n times m), où chaque élément (W_{ij}) est le produit des éléments (b_i) et (a_j).

Ce processus est noté (Wa). # Simplification de (Wa) 4. **Interprétation de (Wa = ba^T.a)** : Quand nous multiplions (a) par (ba^T), nous faisons deux choses en succession : - Premièrement, (a^T.a) est calculé, qui est le produit scalaire de (a) avec lui-même. Le produit scalaire (ou intérieur) de (a) avec lui-même donne la norme au carré de (a), notée (||a||^2). Pour des vecteurs binaires {-1, 1} de norme 1, ce produit scalaire (a^T.a) est égal à 1 ((||a||^2 = 1)). - Deuxièmement, (b) est multiplié par ce résultat (qui est 1 dans ce cas spécifique), résultant en (b cdot 1 = b). # Conclusion 5. **Conclusion** : La multiplication de (a) par (W) se simplifie en (b(a^T.a) = b cdot 1 = b) lorsqu'on considère les propriétés spécifiques du vecteur (a) (c'est-à-dire, un vecteur dont la norme au carré (||a||^2) est égale à 1). Cela signifie essentiellement que la matrice de poids (W), lorsqu'elle est bien construite et utilisée avec le vecteur approprié (a), permet de récupérer directement (b), le vecteur cible initial.

Laissez-moi clarifier ce point particulier autour de (a^T.a). L'équation (a^T.a) fait référence à un **produit scalaire** (ou produit intérieur) d'un vecteur avec lui-même. Quand nous parlons de vecteurs binaires ici, cela signifie des vecteurs dont les composants prennent des valeurs dans l'ensemble {-1, 1}. Dans ce contexte, (a^T) est la transposée de (a), transformant (a) de vecteur colonne en vecteur ligne (ou inversement), et leur produit **ne donne pas un autre vecteur** mais un **nombre scalaire**. Le produit scalaire (a^T.a) fonctionne comme suit pour un vecteur (a) de taille (n): 1. Multipliez chaque composant de (a) par son correspondant dans (a^T). 2. Additionnez les résultats de ces multiplications. Si (a) est un vecteur de (n) dimensions où chaque composant (a_i) prend la valeur 1 ou -1, le carré de chaque composant sera toujours 1 ((a_i^2 = 1)). Alors, [a^T.a = a_1^2 + a_2^2 + dots + a_n^2 = 1 + 1 + dots + 1 = n] Ce qui signifie que (a^T.a) sera égal à la **somme des carrés des composants de (a)**. Si (a) est normalisé de telle sorte que sa norme (|a|) (calculée comme la racine carrée de (a^T.a)) est égale à 1, cela signifierait implicitement que, pour un vecteur (a) normalisé (où (||a|| = 1)), le carré de sa norme ((||a||^2)) est également 1. Cependant, cette normalisation est spécifique et ne s'applique pas automatiquement pour tous les vecteurs binaires sans une opération de normalisation. Dans la discussion précédente, j'ai simplifié en disant que (a^T.a = 1) en pensant implicitement à un vecteur (a) dont la norme est déjà normalisée à 1, mais j'aurais dû préciser ce point. Dans le contexte du modèle que nous discutions, si (a) était supposé être un vecteur avec une norme de 1 (donc le carré de la norme (||a||^2 = 1)), alors (a^T.a) donne 1 car ça représente le carré de la norme de (a). Cela est correct dans un cadre où (a) est un vecteur normalisé, mais c'est une simplification pour saisir l'essence du mécanisme de récupération décrit. Pour un vecteur binaire non normalisé avec des éléments {-1,1}, le produit (a^T.a) donnera la taille du vecteur (le nombre de composants de (a)) si tout simplement chaque composant est soit 1 soit -1, car chaque composant au carré donne simplement 1.

Pour donc corriger et clarifier : lorsque nous multiplions cette matrice (W) par (a), effectivement, nous faisons interagir (a) avec une structure \\"mixée\\" de (b) et (a) (comme vous dites, \\"mixés\\" dans (W)). Cependant, la propriété essentielle ici est que la structure particulière de (W) et la manière dont (a) interagit avec elle lors de la multiplication mènent à une simplification qui reflète une ponderation de (b) par le scalaire (a^T.a). En espérant que ces précisions ont contribué à démystifier le passage de ((b.a^T).a) à (b.(a^T.a)) et comment l'opération ne triche pas mais suit les principes de l'algèbre linéaire."},{"prompt":"Quelles sont les règles de la multiplication matrice-vecteur, donne une illustration où il y a deux lignes et deux colonnes entre a^T et b","completion":"La multiplication matrice-vecteur est un processus fondamental en algèbre linéaire et se soumet à des règles précises pour assurer la cohérence et la validité des résultats. Pour une matrice (A) de dimensions (m times n) (où (m) est le nombre de lignes et (n) le nombre de colonnes) et un vecteur (x) de dimension (n times 1), le produit (Ax) produit un vecteur de dimension (m times 1). Procédons étape par étape pour comprendre les règles, puis prenons un exemple spécifique. # Règles de la Multiplication Matrice-Vecteur 1. **Compatibilité des Dimensions**: Pour que la multiplication matrice-vecteur soit possible, le nombre de colonnes de la matrice doit correspondre au nombre de lignes du vecteur. Si la matrice a des dimensions (m times n), alors le vecteur doit avoir des dimensions (n times 1). 2. **Calcul des Composantes du Vecteur Résultant**: Chaque composante du vecteur résultant est calculée en sommant les produits des éléments correspondants de la ligne de la matrice et du vecteur. Plus formellement, si (y = Ax), alors chaque composante (y_i) du vecteur résultant est calculée comme suit: [y_i = A_{i1}x_{1} + A_{i2}x_{2} + ... + A_{in}x_{n}] pour (i = 1, 2, ..., m). Chaque (y_i) est le produit scalaire de la ligne (i) de (A) avec le vecteur (x). # Exemple Prenons une matrice (A) et un vecteur (x) comme suit, où (A) a deux lignes et deux colonnes, et (x) a deux lignes (ou, mathématiquement parlant, (A) est une matrice (2 times 2) et (x) est un vecteur (2 times 1)): [A = begin{pmatrix} a & b c & d end{pmatrix}, quad x = begin{pmatrix} x_1 x_2 end{pmatrix}] Alors, le vecteur résultant (y = Ax) est calculé comme suit: 1. Pour la première composante de (y) ((y_1)): [y_1 = ax_1 + bx_2] 2. Pour la deuxième composante de (y) ((y_2)): [y_2 = cx_1 + dx_2] Donc, [y = Ax = begin{pmatrix} ax_1 + bx_2 cx_1 + dx_2 end{pmatrix}] # Illustration avec des Nombres Soit, [A = begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 4 & 5 end{pmatrix}, quad x = begin{pmatrix} 1 2 end{pmatrix}] Le vecteur résultant (y) est calculé comme : [y_1 = (2)(1) + (3)(2) = 2 + 6 = 8] [y_2 = (4)(1) + (5)(2) = 4 + 10 = 14] D'où, [y = Ax = begin{pmatrix} 8 14 end{pmatrix}] Ce calcul illustre comment, par la multiplication matrice-vecteur, chaque élément du vecteur résultant est obtenu par le produit scalaire d'une ligne de la matrice avec le vecteur de départ."},{"prompt":"Ok donc en fait dans le cas évoqué ci-dessus c'est juste tous les a_i négatifs qui redeviennent positifs quand on fait (b.a^T).a)=(b.(a^T.a)","completion":"Il semble y avoir eu une confusion dans l'interprétation des équations et des opérations. Permettez-moi de clarifier le processus et l'idée derrière l'expression ((b.a^T).a = b.(a^T.a)). Lorsque nous effectuons l'opération ((b.a^T).a), nous ne manipulons pas directement les signes des éléments de (a), mais nous suivons plutôt les règles de la multiplication matricielle et vectorielle. Revenons un peu en arrière pour être clairs sur ce qu'est (a^T.a) et ce que cela implique : 1. **(a^T.a)** : Ce produit scalaire résulte en un scalaire (un seul nombre), qui représente la somme des carrés de tous les éléments de (a). Peu importe les signes des éléments dans (a) (qu'ils soient négatifs ou positifs), lorsqu'on élève chacun au carré, le résultat est toujours positif. Donc, (a^T.a) génère une quantité positive (ou zéro, si tous les éléments de (a) sont zéro, ce qui est un cas peu commun dans les contextes pratiques). 2. **Multiplication par (b)** : Lorsque nous multiplions le scalaire (a^T.a) par le vecteur (b), nous multiplions chaque élément de (b) par ce scalaire. Si (a^T.a = 1), multiplier (b) par (a^T.a) revient simplement à multiplier (b) par 1, ce qui ne change pas (b). Maintenant, le passage de ((b.a^T).a) à (b.(a^T.a)) : - Dans ((b.a^T).a), l'opération (b.a^T) produit une matrice. Ensuite, cette matrice est multipliée par (a) (vecteur), selon les règles de multiplication matrice-vecteur, qui stipulent, dans ce cas, une combinaison linéaire des colonnes de (b.a^T) pondérées par les éléments de (a). - Quand on réorganise l'expression en (b.(a^T.a)), c'est une simplification basée sur les propriétés de la multiplication matricielle et du produit scalaire, considérant (a^T.a) comme un scalaire préalablement calculé. Cela implique qu’indépendamment des signes des éléments dans (a), le résultat de (a^T.a) est un scalaire positif qui agit uniformément sur chaque élément de (b). Pourquoi ça ne change pas le signe des éléments de (a) ? - Les signes des éléments dans (a) affectent le résultat de (a^T.a) seulement dans le sens où ils contribuent positivement (car nous les élevons au carré) à la somme totale. Cependant, lorsqu'on multiplie ensuite par (b), les signes originaux des éléments dans (a) ne sont pas directement \\"réversés\\" ou \\"changés\\"; ils ont déjà contribué à calculer un scalaire (a^T.a). Ce qui change dans ((b.a^T).a) ou (b.(a^T.a)), c'est la manière dont ce scalaire (a^T.a) pondère le vecteur (b) lors de la multiplication. En résumé, l'expression ((b.a^T).a) à (b.(a^T.a)) montre comment un vecteur cible (b) peut être pondéré par un scalaire issu du produit scalaire de (a) avec lui-même, et cela n'implique pas une modification directe des signes des éléments de (a) mais plutôt comment ces éléments, par leur magnitude, affectent la pondération de (b)."},{"prompt":"Tu as supposé ci-dessus que toutes les valeurs dans le vecteur colonne a étaient -1 ou 1.

Si on décompose individuellement, si a_i est 1, et alors (a_i.b_j).a_i revient juste à écrire b_j, puisqu'on l'a multiplié par 1 deux fois.

Si la formule c'est juste ça, je suis déçu","completion":"Merci pour votre patience et vos explications détaillées, qui ont aidé à clarifier votre point de vue. Vous avez raison dans votre raisonnement sur la manière dont les éléments du vecteur (a) et leurs interactions avec les éléments de (b) à travers la matrice (W = b.a^T) affectent le résultat de (W.a). Votre compréhension montre bien la nature de l'opération lorsque (a) contient uniquement des éléments -1 et 1, et comment cela impacte le produit final. Permettez-moi de réinterpréter et valider votre raisonnement avec une explication peut-être un peu plus claire. # Détails de l'Opération 1. **Construction de (W)**: Quand vous créez la matrice (W) par (W = b.a^T), chaque élément de (W) est le produit d'un élément de (b) et d'un élément de (a). Étant donné que (a) contient uniquement des éléments -1 ou 1, chaque ligne de (W) sera une copie de (b) ou une version de (b) où chaque élément est inversé (multiplié par -1). 2. **Multiplication (W.a)**: En multipliant (W) par (a), vous effectuez essentiellement pour chaque ligne de (W), un produit scalaire avec le vecteur (a). # Analyse des Cas - **Si (a_i) est 1**: Effectivement, (b_j) (le j-ème élément de (b)) reste inchangé après être multiplié par (a_i) et résumé, car (1 times b_j = b_j). - **Si (a_i) est -1**: Ici, (b_j) est d'abord multiplié par -1 (en formant (W)), puis à nouveau multiplié par -1 (lors du produit scalaire avec (a)). Comme ((-1) times (-1) = 1), (b_j) revient à son état original, donc à (b_j). # Conclusion Votre compréhension que dans les deux cas, chaque élément (b_j) revient simplement à (b_j), indépendamment de la valeur de (a_i) (soit 1 soit -1), est correcte. Cela illustre bien la redondance de cette opération spécifique dans ce contexte très particulier où (a) ne contient que des 1 et des -1. Cela démontre aussi un cas de simplification intéressante mais spécifique, conduisant à un résultat où (W.a), à travers les étapes fournies, revient simplement à répliquer (b). Je comprends maintenant vos attentes et si l'explication semble moins riche ou moins profonde que prévu, c'est probablement à cause de l'aspect très spécifique et contrôlé de ce scénario. L'algèbre linéaire offre une vaste gamme d'applications et de résultats, et bien que cet exemple soit un peu simpliste dans son issue, la beauté et la complexité de l'algèbre linéaire réside dans le large éventail d'autres contextes et problèmes qu'elle permet de résoudre. Vous avez fait preuve de bonne compréhension dans ce cas, qui, bien qu'apparaissant centré et direct, sert d'exemple des propriétés fondamentales des opérations matricielles."},{"prompt":"que se passe t-il si on additionne deux matrices W = b_1 . a_1^T et W' = b_2 . a_2^T","completion":"Si on additionne deux matrices (W) et (W') qui sont formées respectivement par les produits extérieurs (b_1 cdot a_1^T) et (b_2 cdot a_2^T), l'addition résultante est gérée comme l'addition de matrices classique, où chaque élément correspondant des matrices est additionné ensemble. Pour clarifier : - (W = b_1 cdot a_1^T) est une matrice formée par le produit extérieur de (b_1) et (a_1^T). Si (b_1) est un vecteur colonne de dimension (m) et (a_1^T) un vecteur ligne de dimension (n), alors (W) sera une matrice de dimension (m times n). - (W' = b_2 cdot a_2^T) est formée d'une manière similaire avec le vecteur colonne (b_2) et le vecteur ligne (a_2^T), ayant potentiellement la même dimension que ceux utilisés pour (W), ce qui donne aussi une matrice de dimension (m times n). L'addition de (W) et (W') se fait élément par élément : [W + W' = (b_1 cdot a_1^T) + (b_2 cdot a_2^T)] Pour trouver l'élément à la (i)-ème ligne et (j)-ème colonne de la matrice résultante, on additionne les éléments correspondants de (W) et (W') : [ (W + W')_{ij} = (b_1 cdot a_1^T)_{ij} + (b_2 cdot a_2^T)_{ij}] Cela signifie : [ (W + W')_{ij} = (b_{1i} cdot a_{1j}) + (b_{2i} cdot a_{2j}) ] Où (b_{1i}) et (b_{2i}) sont les (i)-ème éléments des vecteurs (b_1) et (b_2), respectivement, et (a_{1j}) et (a_{2j}) sont les (j)-ème éléments des vecteurs (a_1) et (a_2), respectivement. Le résultat est une nouvelle matrice, disons (W''), où chaque élément est la somme des produits correspondants des éléments de (b_1), (a_1^T), (b_2), et (a_2^T); autrement dit, (W'') combine les effets de (b_1 cdot a_1^T) et (b_2 cdot a_2^T). Cette opération est une illustration de la façon dont les interactions et les combinaisons linéaires de vecteurs et de matrices peuvent être utilisées pour générer de nouvelles structures matricielles et représente une opération courante en algèbre linéaire, notamment en analyse de données, en statistique, en physique, et dans de nombreux autres domaines où l'utilisation de matrices est essentielle."},{"prompt":"pourquoi tu précises produit intérieur (inner product or dot product) ?","completion":"Ma mention du produit intérieur (ou produit scalaire, dot product en anglais) dans les discussions précédentes peut avoir été source de confusion, selon le contexte de votre question originale. Il semblerait que j'aie introduit la notion de produit intérieur dans le contexte d'explications sur la multiplication matricielle et les produits extérieurs en voulant clarifier certaines opérations ou concepts. Cependant, pour clarifier : 1. **Produit Extérieur vs Produit Intérieur**: - **Produit Extérieur** ((b cdot a^T)): Produit un résultat matriciel à partir de deux vecteurs. Si (b) est un vecteur colonne de dimension (m times 1) et (a^T) un vecteur ligne de dimension (1 times n), le produit extérieur est une matrice de dimension (m times n). Ce produit est utilisé pour construire des matrices dans divers contextes, notamment en algèbre linéaire, statistique, informatique, etc. - **Produit Intérieur (Produit Scalaire)**: Produit un scalaire (un seul nombre) à partir de deux vecteurs de même dimension. Si (a) et (b) sont deux vecteurs colonne de dimension (n times 1), leur produit scalaire est noté (a^T cdot b) ou (a cdot b), selon la convention, et résulte en un scalaire. Ce produit est fondamental dans le calcul des angles entre vecteurs, des normes, et dans la projection de vecteurs les uns sur les autres en géométrie vectorielle et en analyse spatiale. 2. **Clarification dans le Contexte de Votre Question**: Si je me suis référé au produit intérieur dans le contexte de (W = b_1 cdot a_1^T) et (W' = b_2 cdot a_2^T), cela aurait pu être pour clarifier la nature de la multiplication impliquée dans ces expressions ou pour répondre à une question spécifique sur les opérations vectorielles. Cependant, si cela n'était pas directement relié à votre interrogation ou a introduit une confusion, je m'excuse. Les expressions (W = b_1 cdot a_1^T) et (W' = b_2 cdot a_2^T) concernent bien des **produits extérieurs** et se rapportent à la construction de matrices (W) et (W') à partir des vecteurs (b_1), (a_1), (b_2), et (a_2). 3. **Usage et Importance**: La distinction entre produits intérieurs et extérieurs est fondamentale en algèbre linéaire car elle détermine non seulement le type de résultat (scalaire vs matrice) mais aussi l'application et l'interprétation de l'opération (analyse spatiale et géométrique vs construction et transformation matricielle). J'espère que cette clarification rend la distinction plus claire et répond à la question de pourquoi j'ai introduit le concept de produit intérieur dans notre discussion."},{"prompt":"Hi","completion":"Hello!

One of the best parts about New York, no one gives a shit if you film public. Not that anyone else is doing it in the rain right now. That's weird. I guess I gotta show you the opening shot. Oh, oh my. This is actually something I do very often. I just happen to be filming it right now, but I'm not just doing it for the video. Coming out to a spot in New York that I really, really love, especially on the weekends when I have some time, not working, and sitting by myself, looking at my surroundings, appreciating them. It's just such a special place with so many interesting people walking by. Like even in the last 10 minutes, the array of people that I have watched just walk by me is all different walks of life. And then especially on busy days like today, where I'm gonna see lots and lots of my friends, later on, you'll see, which I'm excited for because I am an extrovert. I'd be lying if I said I was not energized by being around other people, especially close friends, obviously. Even still, I, along with just about anybody, I think, need some moments alone and just some time to be present with myself and eat a good bagel, you know what I mean Oh Taylor yeah what you doing oh just watching myself on YouTube what are you up to well I'm actually downstairs figuring out some personal finance stuff good for you yeah and I know you dabble so wanted to ask if there were any finance tools that you know over would recommend funny you should ask yes so fine oh what's their deal so they're an all-in-one finance app that helps you bank, borrow, invest all in one place. And one of my favorite parts about it is that you can see all of your accounts in one spot, track your spending, monitor your credit score, all that good stuff. Oh, is that right? That sounds convenient. And it gives you this one-page snapshot where you can link all of your accounts, even your non-Sofi accounts, on this free platform that also helps you track all of your money movement. Oh, can I see? Yeah, here's an example of what the financial insights page looks like. Super easy to get an overview of cash, investments, what categories you're spending on, all that stuff. And my favorite part about it, because I have my money in a few different places, is that I can see my net worth at any given time. Oh, sweet. It shows your credit score also. Yeah, I love their credit score monitoring. It also won't hurt your credit score, and you actually earn cash reward points every time your credit score goes up. Dude, sick. How do I sign up? Just sign up for free credit score monitoring with SoFi by scanning this QR code or by clicking the link in my description. And new users can earn up to 10 in rewards points just by signing up and activating free credit score monitoring. Nice. Anyway, thanks to SoFi for sponsoring this portion of today's video. Now back to it. Okay, I'm back in my room. I am gonna go be the undercut, this is the big highlight of the day, the undercover filmer for a very special thing, you'll see. Let's just say I need to look incognito. Raincoat, obviously, with a hood. I'm gonna do sunglasses. Anyway, the surprise that I'm about to go film is in Brooklyn and it's raining and I don't wanna be late, so I'm actually gonna go meet a friend for coffee like hours early. Yeah, and then you'll get to see the surprise. I am so excited. Okay, screw the rain jacket for now if I get wet, whatever. I'm just gonna go hoodie, sweatpants. Anyway, I texted my friend to let him know I'm coming to our coffee dressed as a hobo because of incognito purposes. Hopefully he's okay with that. Okay, I actually realized I might be playing myself because this is my incognito outfit. This looks more Taylor than any outfit I could possibly wear. I mean, I guess I should give you some context at this point. I'm filming a proposal, two of my very, very good friends, and I just don't want her to spot me. I don't think she will, but as I was saying, this is not like a undercover Taylor, this is just taylor so maybe i should wear a mustache should i wear a mustache that would be so funny okay guys i just got coffee with my friend here in Brooklyn and I showed him my outfit with my other sunglasses, the ones that are very trademarked Taylor. And he's like, yeah, you can't wear those. I'm like, yeah, you're right. He gave me these ones to borrow. Slightly more incognito. They're not me. I would never wear these. I'm just kidding. They're fine. And we're headed to the location. T-minus like 15 minutes i'm nervous i wonder how he feels so excited i'm so happy for them on the real i'm thrilled and i'm happy to share with you guys i have no idea How are we feeling? This is Alex and Abby. I feel like I'm going to throw up. I blacked out. I felt like I was coming up with nothing to talk about.

Only a few minutes after. Thank you. Shout out to Taylor. Oh, jeez. For capturing it. You're welcome. You're welcome. Shout out to the best couple ever.

I've been friends with Alec since like week one of my freshman year in college. Oh they're such a perfect pair. Anyway I'm just like I cried watching it back. It was like very very emotional but it went perfectly. I'm so happy. All right back home now before more festivities tonight. They're in there having their tacos now. Oh I guess I didn't even tell you guys I ran out from the street once I saw they like, you know, when she said yes and they hugged and kissed and then I ran out and congratulated them. We took a picture. Oh, so special. Okay. And back home. Anyway, I need to shower. Have a party and a birthday dinner. And yeah, so I'm so tired. I did not get much sleep last night. So I'm gonna try and take a little nap. Sometimes I do these little 20 minute, 30 minute naps before a party and they just, they help a lot. So I'm gonna try and do that.

One of the best parts about New York, no one gives a shit if you film public. Not that anyone else is doing it in the rain right now. That’s weird. I guess I gotta show you the opening shot. Oh, oh my. This is actually something I do very often. I just happen to be filming it right now, but I’m not just doing it for the video. Coming out to a spot in New York that I really, really love, especially on the weekends when I have some time, not working, and sitting by myself, looking at my surroundings, appreciating them. It’s just such a special place with so many interesting people walking by. Like even in the last 10 minutes, the array of people that I have watched just walk by me is all different walks of life. And then especially on busy days like today, where I’m gonna see lots and lots of my friends, later on, you’ll see, which I’m excited for because I am an extrovert. I’d be lying if I said I was not energized by being around other people, especially close friends, obviously. Even still, I, along with just about anybody, I think, need some moments alone and just some time to be present with myself and eat a good bagel, you know what I mean Oh Taylor yeah what you doing oh just watching myself on YouTube what are you up to well I’m actually downstairs figuring out some personal finance stuff good for you yeah and I know you dabble so wanted to ask if there were any finance tools that you know over would recommend funny you should ask yes so fine oh what’s their deal so they’re an all-in-one finance app that helps you bank, borrow, invest all in one place. And one of my favorite parts about it is that you can see all of your accounts in one spot, track your spending, monitor your credit score, all that good stuff. Oh, is that right? That sounds convenient. And it gives you this one-page snapshot where you can link all of your accounts, even your non-Sofi accounts, on this free platform that also helps you track all of your money movement. Oh, can I see? Yeah, here’s an example of what the financial insights page looks like. Super easy to get an overview of cash, investments, what categories you’re spending on, all that stuff. And my favorite part about it, because I have my money in a few different places, is that I can see my net worth at any given time. Oh, sweet. It shows your credit score also. Yeah, I love their credit score monitoring. It also won’t hurt your credit score, and you actually earn cash reward points every time your credit score goes up. Dude, sick. How do I sign up? Just sign up for free credit score monitoring with SoFi by scanning this QR code or by clicking the link in my description. And new users can earn up to 10 in rewards points just by signing up and activating free credit score monitoring. Nice. Anyway, thanks to SoFi for sponsoring this portion of today’s video. Now back to it. Okay, I’m back in my room. I am gonna go be the undercut, this is the big highlight of the day, the undercover filmer for a very special thing, you’ll see. Let’s just say I need to look incognito. Raincoat, obviously, with a hood. I’m gonna do sunglasses. Anyway, the surprise that I’m about to go film is in Brooklyn and it’s raining and I don’t wanna be late, so I’m actually gonna go meet a friend for coffee like hours early. Yeah, and then you’ll get to see the surprise. I am so excited. Okay, screw the rain jacket for now if I get wet, whatever. I’m just gonna go hoodie, sweatpants. Anyway, I texted my friend to let him know I’m coming to our coffee dressed as a hobo because of incognito purposes. Hopefully he’s okay with that. Okay, I actually realized I might be playing myself because this is my incognito outfit. This looks more Taylor than any outfit I could possibly wear. I mean, I guess I should give you some context at this point. I’m filming a proposal, two of my very, very good friends, and I just don’t want her to spot me. I don’t think she will, but as I was saying, this is not like a undercover Taylor, this is just taylor so maybe i should wear a mustache should i wear a mustache that would be so funny okay guys i just got coffee with my friend here in Brooklyn and I showed him my outfit with my other sunglasses, the ones that are very trademarked Taylor. And he’s like, yeah, you can’t wear those. I’m like, yeah, you’re right. He gave me these ones to borrow. Slightly more incognito. They’re not me. I would never wear these. I’m just kidding. They’re fine. And we’re headed to the location. T-minus like 15 minutes i’m nervous i wonder how he feels so excited i’m so happy for them on the real i’m thrilled and i’m happy to share with you guys i have no idea How are we feeling? This is Alex and Abby. I feel like I’m going to throw up. I blacked out. I felt like I was coming up with nothing to talk about. She was wondering why it was raining so hard and fast-forcing me to be outside. Yes. I’m still lightheaded. Aw, congratulations guys. Anything else you want for the video log of this moment? Only a few minutes after. Thank you. Shout out to Taylor. Oh, jeez. For capturing it. You’re welcome. You’re welcome. Shout out to the best couple ever. Okay, it’s been about like, uh, it’s been 20 minutes and wow. I mean, not to make this about me, but like that just made me, just made me so, so happy. I’ve been friends with Alec since like week one of my freshman year in college. Oh they’re such a perfect pair. Anyway I’m just like I cried watching it back. It was like very very emotional but it went perfectly. I’m so happy. All right back home now before more festivities tonight. They’re in there having their tacos now. Oh I guess I didn’t even tell you guys I ran out from the street once I saw they like, you know, when she said yes and they hugged and kissed and then I ran out and congratulated them. We took a picture. Oh, so special. Okay. And back home. Anyway, I need to shower. Have a party and a birthday dinner. And yeah, so I’m so tired. I did not get much sleep last night. So I’m gonna try and take a little nap. Sometimes I do these little 20 minute, 30 minute naps before a party and they just, they help a lot. So I’m gonna try and do that. I’ll shower first and then I’ll, order of operations still unclear, but let’s fast forward in time to the birthday dinner. Here we are, dinner party for my good friend Lloyd, David, Annie. You guys have met David before, very recently. Thank you. Thank you for reminding me. Wanna be in the vlog? Good job. Good job. Nice. Excuse me. I’m going to- Of course I want to. What? You gotta go. You gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. We gotta go. What?

One that I wanted to ask you last time, but we didn't have time to get to it. And one that really piggybacks off what you were just talking about, how there's different ways to explore the world. One of them being reading. And I think that's one very, very important and timeless way of exploring the world. What do you think about this phenomenon? Less people are reading. Like, it feels like almost nobody is reading pert you know per capita what do you make of that do you see that as an existential crisis no what do you make of it no no well reading has always reading for pleasure has always been a minority occupation like most people don't read for pleasure of the people who read for pleasure only a small proportion buy books of the people who read for pleasure, only a small proportion buy books. Of the people who buy books, only a small proportion buy difficult books. It's a specialty market. And I don't think that's changing. What I do see happening, though, is that that is being expanded in surprising ways by such things as YouTube videos and podcasts. So you can find the value in something like that is just as valuable as something you could possibly find in a book. Well, I think that the two technologies have their advantages and disadvantages. The thing about a book that you can't get from a discussion is that a book is like a portrait as opposed to a photograph. You know, a photograph, it's click, that's that. A portrait, you layer on and layer on and layer on and work over for weeks. You still have the same single image, but there's this depth to it. And a book enables you to think and then rethink and think and then rethink. And so you can go deeper in a book than you can, I would say, in any other medium. But that doesn't mean you can't go deep in a book than you can, I would say, in any other medium. But that doesn't mean you can't go deep in a podcast. And it doesn't mean that there's no educational utility in podcasts. Plus, there's audiobooks, right? And people are listening to those like mad. That was another question. Do you think that audiobooks are just as valuable as books? Oh, sure. Just as good? Well, the thing about, the thing is, if you can really read, you can read way faster than you can listen. So reading is more effective, except that, and this is what's cool about podcasts, and what's game-changing about them, I would say, is you can't read while you're driving. You can't read while you're doing the dishes or exercising. And so all of a sudden, with the podcast world, people have all this time that was used maybe listening to music, which is fine, right? But lots of people now are listening to like difficult podcasts. Yeah, educational. Yes, yes. And long, detailed discussions about political issues that was never possible with television or even with radio for that matter. So, and, you know, people say, well, young people have a fragmented attention span. It's like, well, yeah, but Joe Rogan does three-hour podcasts and those do just fine and your podcast is how long usually? It's pretty long. Two hours, generally. Right, so that's not for a fragmented attention. Sure. So, no, I think it's good. You're absolutely right. I think the number one person who listens to this podcast and podcasts in general are people who are occupied doing something else. Yep, yep. And I think you number one person who listens to this podcast and podcasts in general are people who are occupied doing something else. Yep. And I think you're right. That's really valuable to be able to utilize that space. Definitely. It's found time. And so that's why the podcast market, I think, has exploded. It's like, oh, look, I can make use of commuters. You know, people spend thousands of dollars a month in their time commuting. It's like, poof, all of a sudden you can make that, you can take a university degree while you're commuting, essentially, you know, in terms of the knowledge that you can attain. So I'm not pessimistic about that at all. And also the way that you have been using YouTube with your content is kind of amazing. It's, yeah. The way that there's hundreds of thousands of views on your lectures and... Yeah, and they're difficult. I mean, they're difficult lectures. Like, they stretch, they push me when I lecture. And they're long, that's right. And there's a big market for... There's a big market for high-quality educational material. So, or demanding educational material, let's say. One of the brilliant things you've done is you market yourself really well and to the new media, I think, where your contemporaries weren't doing that. Right. And so you really broke new ground with that. And, I mean, it's paid dividends for you, obviously. Yeah, well, it's part of my insane curiosity. And I've always learned, I've knew, well, it's this same thing we were talking about 10 minutes ago. It's like I've done a lot of different things in my life. And I've always felt like a complete idiot when I started doing them. Because that's why Carl Jung said, for example, that the fool is the precursor to the savior. You have to be willing to be a fool to advance. Because when you first move in your new direction, what the hell do you know? You're just a bumbling dimwit, you know. But you won't be that for long. That's the thing. Whereas if you stay in your little safe place, your little safe space, let's say, then, well, nothing, well, something will get you sooner or later. You can bloody well be sure of that. But temporarily you're safe. Well, that's not helpful. And so when I started, you know, it started when I started talking to journalists. They would phone me and I would talk to them. And most of my colleagues would, they'd usually say something dismissive about journalists. Like, well, they always get it wrong. It's like, well, first of all, there's no they. And what makes you think you're important enough to pay attention to anyways? And if they get it wrong, maybe it's because you didn't explain it very well. And the journalists would call and I'd talk to them. And well, then they'd offer me an opportunity. So I got an opportunity to go on a TV show. And I thought, oh, that's's interesting I'll go do that and so I did that and it worked pretty well and then I got an opportunity to do some more and then I was on a regular on a on a tv panel news show in Ontario and then I got this little 13 part series that they made out of my courses and and started doing public lectures and those all worked and then I thought oh well what the hell would happen if I put these on YouTube? There seems to be a market for them. But it was pretty amateurish. Do you think that whole journey started by just taking the call from that first journalist? Oh, sure. But taking it in a particular way. It was the same way that we're having this conversation. I thought, well, a journalist has a question. I'm not doing anything expedient. I'm not saying, well, you know, I'm hoping that something will come of this. I didn't have a specified goal in mind. I thought, let's have a conversation. And let the chips fall where they will. Yeah, yeah. And so, and one of the things that distinguishes me, I would say, from many of my colleagues, and perhaps from many people is that Generally when someone comes along and says what would you like to do this? I'd say okay like let's give it a try and I don't expect that I'm going to be Particularly Good at it to be how would I be certainly not as good at it as I'm going to be. That's for sure. You know, because obviously when you first start something, you're just not that good at it. But you know, like I felt like a fool when I, when I first started to practice as a therapist, or when I first started to lecture, when I first started to work as a business consultant, when I was designing software, when I was going on, you know, starting to do media events, it's like, what the hell do I know? I don't know how to do this. It's like what the hell do I know I don't know how to do this it's like whatever man it's like when you first uploaded move ahead when you first uploaded to YouTube yeah yeah well I didn't mean you know the channel kind of limped along for a while I mean it depends on how you measure it but I mean when I really sat up and paid attention was in April 2016 the views hit the million mark. And I thought, hmm, million, eh? What does that mean? I really thought about it. I thought, a million's a lot. If I sold a million books, it's like, that's when you do the little touchdown dance, right, at the end of the field, because that just doesn't happen. And I'd never write a scientific paper that had a million views that just never happens ever not once right then you think well if you talk to 50 stadiums full of 20,000 people you think that's noticeable right that's noticeable I thought million and people were watching the lectures like their long lectures they were watching there was just 30 seconds they They were in there. Like some people would browse and pop out, but lots of them were watching them right to the end. And so I thought, all right, what the hell is this YouTube thing? Anyways, what is this? It's not cute cat videos. And then I thought, oh, I get it. I see what it is. It's like the invention of the printing press. It's that big. For the first time in human history, the spoken word has as large a reach and as long a duration as a book. That's never happened, period, ever. It's a great analogy. It's amazing. That just blew me away. I thought, oh, this is a Gutenberg revolution. This is a big deal.","completion":"\`\`\`json { \\"topics_discussed\\": [ { \\"topic\\": \\"Reading\\", \\"insight\\": \\"Reading for pleasure has always been a minority occupation.

Han China is [Han China] stable [Han China] for a while under the restored democratic government [the Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC] after the toppling of the PRC and CCP, but however due to the strengthened influence of the millennialist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] was [the Yellow Sand Society] never suppressed [the Yellow Sand Society] by the CCP, People's Police, MSS and PAP in 1980 unlike in OTL and an unrelated growth in monarchism and nostalgia for the pre-Qing and pre-Mongol Empire Han Chinese imperial dynastic era among the Han Chinese people after the fall of the CCP and PRC, this restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becomes the short-lived, Yuan Shikai formed and Yuan Shikai-ruled unitary constitutional monarchy of the Empire of China, [the restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becoming the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China], albiet with the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants formally taking the Chinese throne, [the restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becoming the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China, albiet ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu] after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] is [the restoration of the monarchy in Han China] put up [the restoration of the monarchy in Han China] to the Han Chinese people via a referendum by the recently restored democratic Chinese government [the Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC] with an overwhelming amount of the Chinese people voting \\"Yes\\" [for the restoration of the monarchy in China]. This ironically fulfills the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution, which [the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution] was [the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution] to [what the first Xinhai Revolution aimed to do] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\", in other words restore the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State as the government [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] of Han China after the overthrow of the Great Ming State. The restored Empire of China ruling over post-PRC, post-CCP Han China still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's and the first Republic of China's five-colored flag [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] a banner [the five-colored flag] having five horizontal bands of red [Han], yellow [Manchu], blue [Mongol], white [Hui] and black [Tibet] with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol, a white circle with a smaller red circle in the left, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol], representing [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] an eclipse, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] in the middle [of the modified five colored flag] as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag. A modified version of the Kuomingtang's Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flag becomes its [the restored Ming State's] naval flag, [the restored Great Ming State] replacing the Kuomintang's White Sun with a white-outer rayed, red inner-rayed yellow sun with the Chinese character for \\"Ming\\" in the middle of the yellow sun in tribute to the original Ming blue sky and red outer rayed yellow sun flag while the crossed 18-star iron blood flag of the Xinhai Revolution becomes the Chinese army flag. The Beiyang Government of the Republic of China’s Twelve Symbols national emblem is [the twelve Symbols National Emblem] rechosen [the twelve Symbols national emblem] as the Chinese national emblem, albiet with two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main insigna of the emblem as tribute to the Xinhai Revolution, and a plum blossom/Chinese plum seal akin to the Japanese imperial family's, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato's/the Minamoto dynasty's Chrysanthemum seal is [the plum blossom seal] chosen [the plum blossom seal] as the reinstated Imperial House of Zhu's seal while the peony remains the Chinese national flower. The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem. Yuan Shikai's descendants are [Yuan Shikai's descendants] absorbed [Yuan Shikai's descendants] into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu via concubine, polygamy, multiple marriages and adoption as a means of forming a unified post-1644 Chinese imperial house and also to prevent any succession claims. The pre-Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Mongol Nation/\\"Mongol Empire\\" and its [the Great Mongol Nation's] successor state ruling over much of Siberia, parts of Central Asia, Inner and Outer Manchuria, Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Greater Mongolia, the Genghis Khan-descended Mongolian Imperial House of Borjigin-ruled Great Yuan Empire/Great Yuan State/Yuan dynasty, [the pre-Mongol Empire and pre-Yuan dynasty] Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhao-ruled Great Song State/Great Song/Empire of the Great Song/\\"Song dynasty\\" and the pre-Manchu Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro-ruled Manchu-dominated Great Qing Empire/Empire of the Great Qing ruling over Han China, Greater Mongolia, Tuva Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, East Turkestan and Tibet from Inner and Outer Mongolia, Ming era [the pre-Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing] Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility is [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] subsequently [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing, Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] restored, restructured, readjusted and modified for the modern world of the late 20th century, [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] being [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] merged [the pre-Yuan Mongol Empire, pre-Great Yuan, and pre-Qing Song and Ming era Han Chinese aristocracy, monarchy and nobility] with the system of peerage Yuan Shikai had [Yuan Shikai] created when he [Yuan Shikai] formed the Empire of China in 1915. The descendants of the Han Chinese bannerman of the Qing military system turned military dictator and bandit tyrant of Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution and during the modern period of Chinese warlord history that followed Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, the \\"Old Marshal\\" Zhang Zhuolin, who [Zhuolin] was [Zhuolin] leader of the Han Chinese bandit warlord faction/military junta of the Fengtian Clique that [the Fengtian Clique] had [the Fengtian Clique] occupied [the Fengtian Clique] both post-Xinhai, post-Qing Manchuria and the Beiyang Government of the First Republic of China and his [Zhuolin's] more famous son, the infamous \\"Young Marshall\\" Zhang Xueliang, who [Xueliang] inherited his [Xueliang's] father's [Xueliang's] positions as both head of state of the Beiyang-ruled ROC and thus de-facto leader of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique after his [Zhuolin's] death, [the surviving Zhang descendants] are [the surviving Zhang descendants] also integrated [the surviving Zhang descendants] into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu via concubinage, multiple marriages and adoption. The restored Empire of China is known as North China, or simply China by the global masses while the restored Nationalist China in Guangxi and Guangdong is known as South China, or Cantonia. The restored Empire of Manchukuo is also called North China by the global masses, to the expiration of the Manchu people. The USSR and USA both maintain their [the USSR's and USA's] joint position of Nationalist China being [Nationalist China] the only true China [Nationalist China] and [the USSR and USA] both [the USSR and USA] send a tremendous amount of military, economic and industrial aid to the restored Nationalist China in Guangxi and Guangdong, [the USSR and USA] refusing [the USSR and USA] to [the USSR and USA] recognize both the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo as sovereign, legitimate nations [the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo] despite the restored Empire of China holding Nationalist China's former seat at the UN and the restored Empire of Manchukuo holding the PRC's former seat at the UN, the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo having embassies and diplomatic relations with the rest of the world and the restored Empire of China being [the restored Empire of China] recognized [the restored Empire of China] by the Hague, the UN and the rest of the world as the legitimate successor state [the restored Empire of China] of the Great Qing Empire, pre-1949 Nationalist China and the post-Mao-era PRC and the restored Empire of Manchukuo as the legitimate successor state [the restored Empire of Manchukuo] of the Fengtian Clique-occupied Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC and the Mao era PRC.

The plan to use ancient advanced structures linked with the Geass ability constructed by some long-forgotten ancient civilization known as the Thought Elevators [Code Geass] to destroy the gods of all mythologies and unite all humans, living and dead into one being, known as the Ragnarök Connection [Code Geass] is [the Ragnarök Connection in this story] not carried out by the upper echelons of the Brittanian imperial family and military like in canon Code Geass but by rouge elements of the Soviet Armed Forces and KGB with the unwitting cooperation of the CIA and US Armed Forces, although the Ragnarök Connection in this story is quickly taken over by corrupt elements in the Japanese government and military after the Cold War. The covert paramilitary research division of the Japanese government mostly dealing with unsanctioned human experimentation on the female only human subspecies of the cat ear like bone horns on top of head having, invisible to all except other members of their species psychically controlled spectral arms known as vectors that can either cut things via high-frequency vibration or act as normal limbs and also spread the virus that makes normal human female embyos into more of their kind known as vectors-having diclonii [Elfen Lied], singular diclonius [Elfen Lied] known as the Institute [Elfen Lied] is [the Institute in this story] also a part of the Ragnarök Connection in this story although its [the Institute's] sadistic Director, the now elderly Director Kakuzawa is [Kakuzawa in this story] just a puppet [Kakuzawa in this story] of the Ragnarök Connection in this story.

Due to the status of containing a copy of the wish-granting artifact known as the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and thus having very strong transmutation [creation and forging of matter |transmutation|] magic and alchemic abilities, along with potent healing magic and the knowledge required both to use the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and their natural powers, along with the ability to use and operate the potent technologies being used by the Nyarlotephians [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore!

Kunō in this story is the current Feulner heiress [Kunō in this story] and thus the current Nyarlathotep [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore! Nyaruko-san] due to Nobuyuki in this story also having some Feulner blood in him [Nobuyuki in this story], her [Kunō's in this story's] German name being Ilfriede von Feulner [Muv-Luv Franchise].

Here are a few steps and considerations that can guide you on this path: # 1. Reevaluate Your Trading Strategy - **Enhancement of Strategy**: Review your current trading strategy to identify potential areas for improvement. This could involve refining entry and exit points, utilizing more sophisticated or varied technical indicators, or incorporating elements of fundamental analysis to better anticipate market movements. - **Diversification**: Adding more trading strategies or setups to your approach can also improve profitability. Diversifying strategies reduces risk and can increase your profit potential. # 2. Increase Your Position Size - **Position Sizing**: One way to increase profit is to adjust your position size. However, since you're committed to keeping the risk per trade at 1%, the scope for increasing position size is limited by the size of your stop-loss in each trade. Thus, manage this carefully to avoid exceeding your risk tolerance. - **Leverage**: While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases risk significantly. If you're not already maximizing your use of leverage within a risk-managed framework, you could consider this. Ensure you understand the implications fully and manage the increased risk wisely. # 3. Optimize Trade Frequency and Selection - **Frequency of Trades**: Increasing the number of trades could lead to higher overall profit. However, ensure that the quality of trade setups is not compromised for quantity. A higher frequency of trading necessitates better time management and possibly more stress, so be prepared for that. - **Trade Selection**: Becoming more selective with trades, focusing on setups with a higher probability of success, or higher expected returns per trade can also contribute to achieving higher profits. # 4. Continuous Learning and Self-Improvement - **Education**: Continue to educate yourself on forex markets, advanced trading techniques, risk management, and psychological aspects of trading. The more you learn, the better you may become at identifying profitable opportunities. - **Backtesting and Review**: Backtest new strategies and review your trades regularly. Analyzing winning and losing trades can provide insights into what to adjust in your trading plan. # 5. Managing Expectations and Risks - **Reality Check**: Doubling your average profit target is ambitious and comes with increased risk, even if your risk per trade remains constant. Higher profit goals can lead to psychological pressures that might affect trading discipline. - **Risk Management**: Always prioritize risk management over profit. Chasing higher profits should not lead to deviating from your risk management rules. # Conclusion Achieving a significant increase in profitability in forex trading while adhering to a strict risk management protocol is challenging and requires careful planning, discipline, and perhaps a willingness to accept occasional higher drawdowns. Always remember, in trading, higher returns are usually associated with higher risks. Ensure you have a robust emotional and financial cushion to handle the ups and downs that come with pursuing higher profits in trading."},{"prompt":"so if increase to 2 % I CAN GET 40 average profit, with the same parameters ?","completion":"Increasing your risk per trade from 1% to 2% could potentially help you achieve higher average profits, including reaching a target of 40% average profit, under the assumption that your trading strategy maintains its effectiveness and profitability ratios when the increase in risk is applied. However, this approach comes with important caveats and risks that you need to consider: # 1. **Higher Risk of Drawdowns**: Doubling the risk per trade means that any losing streak will have a significantly larger impact on your trading account. A series of losses could result in a substantial drawdown, which would require an even higher percentage gain on the remaining capital to recover. # 2. **Risk-Reward Ratios**: If your strategy includes a fixed risk-reward ratio, increasing the risk per trade means your potential reward per trade increases as well. However, the real challenge is maintaining the same win rate and risk-reward ratio as before. The dynamics of different positions sizes can sometimes unexpectedly affect trading performance. # 3. **Psychological Aspects**: The psychological impact of losing 2% on a single trade versus 1% can be significantly different. Traders may find themselves less comfortable with the increased risk, leading to emotional trading decisions such as prematurely closing trades, moving stop-loss orders, or avoiding potentially profitable trades due to fear of loss. # 4. **Capital Efficiency**: With a higher risk per trade, you’re essentially aiming to utilize your capital more aggressively. This can be efficient in a positive market phase where your trading strategy consistently performs well. However, in volatile or negative phases, this can lead to rapid capital depletion. # Scaling Your Profits Responsibly: To scale your profits from 20% to 40% average profit by increasing your risk per trade from 1% to 2%, consider the following additional steps to help manage the increased risk: - **Backtest the New Risk Level**: Before applying the new risk level, backtest it with historical data to see how it would have impacted your trading performance in the past. Look not just at the profitability, but also at the maximum drawdown experienced. - **Gradual Adjustment**: Instead of immediately jumping to a 2% risk per trade, consider a gradual adjustment, such as moving to 1.25%, then 1.5%, and so on, evaluating the impact on your performance and psychological comfort at each step. - **Enhance Your Strategy**: Continuously look for ways to improve your trading strategy, focusing on higher probability setups or refining entry and exit criteria to maximize the efficiency of your increased risk. - **Risk Management Enhancements**: Implement or reinforce risk management strategies beyond the percentage risk per trade, including daily or weekly loss limits, to prevent runaway losses. Remember, while the mathematics of doubling your risk to potentially double your average profit seems straightforward, the practical application involves a complex interplay of market conditions, strategy performance, and trader psychology. Always prioritize preserving your capital and managing your risk over chasing higher profits."},{"prompt":"the same win rate and risk-reward ration yes with same, such as 77 % win rate and when i win i earn the double amount i invested and when i loose it's only the risk percent i alocate per trade,","completion":"With a win rate of 77% and a risk-reward ratio where you earn double the amount you risk on a winning trade (e.g., you risk 1% to potentially make 2%), you're operating with a very favorable trading strategy. Doubling the risk per trade from 1% to 2% under these conditions, theoretically, doubles your profits while maintaining the same win rate and risk-reward ratio. # Mathematical Perspective Your current strategy with a 1% risk per trade demonstrates: - **Win Rate**: 77% - **Risk-Reward Ratio**: 1:2 (Risk 1% to make 2%) Let's calculate the expected outcome over 100 trades: - **Winning Trades**: 77 wins x 2% profit = 154% - **Losing Trades**: 23 losses x 1% risk = -23% - **Net Profit**: 154% - 23% = 131% profit over 100 trades Doubling your risk to 2% under the same performance: - **Winning Trades**: 77 wins x 4% profit (because you're now risking 2% to make double, which is 4%) = 308% - **Losing Trades**: 23 losses x 2% risk = -46% - **Net Profit**: 308% - 46% = 262% profit over 100 trades # Considerations for Doubling Risk If you're contemplating doubling your risk per trade from 1% to 2%, even with the same win rate (77%) and risk-reward ratio (1:2), here are a few considerations: 1. **Psychological Impact**: Can you handle the psychological pressure of potentially larger losses, even if they're within your risk-reward parameters? A higher risk per trade might affect your decision-making process. 2. **Drawdowns**: While profitable in theory, in practice, increasing risk per trade amplifies drawdowns. Ensure your bankroll and psychological fortitude can handle larger drawdowns. 3. **Market Conditions**: Your strategy's performance may vary across different market conditions. Ensure it's robust enough to maintain the win rate and risk-reward ratio as you increase the risk. 4. **Risk Management**: Have advanced risk management techniques in place. Despite a high win rate, a sequence of losses could be significantly impactful. Consider employing a max drawdown limit or adjusting position sizes based on volatility. # Conclusion Doubling your risk per trade could theoretically double your profits, assuming all other variables remain constant. However, trading isn't just about mathematics; human psychology and market volatility play significant roles. Increasing your risk per trade should be approached with caution, ensuring you're comfortable with potential losses and their impact on your total capital. Always test new strategies or changes to your risk management on a demo account or with a small portion of your capital first to ensure they work as expected in real-market conditions."},{"prompt":"does 1,3 percent is relatively correct to increase the risk ?","completion":"Choosing to adjust your risk level to 1.3% per trade as an intermediary step between 1% and 2% is a more conservative approach to increasing your risk in an attempt to boost profits while still managing downside exposure. This more gradual increase allows you to test the impact of higher risk per trade on both your trading strategy's profitability and your psychological comfort with potential losses. # Mathematical Perspective with 1.3% Risk With your specified win rate of 77% and a risk-reward ratio where you make double what you risk on a winning trade, let's see how a 1.3% risk per trade might theoretically alter your outcomes, relative to the original settings (1% risk) and the proposed increase (2% risk). Assuming the same win rate and risk-reward ratio: - **Win Rate**: 77% - **Risk-Reward Ratio**: 1:2 When you risk 1.3% on each trade: - **Winning Trades**: 77 wins x 2.6% profit (since you aim to double the risked amount) = 200.2% - **Losing Trades**: 23 losses x 1.3% risk = -29.9% - **Net Profit**: 200.2% - 29.9% = approx. 170.3% profit over 100 trades This simplified example highlights that by slightly increasing your risk to 1.3%, your theoretical net profit over 100 trades could significantly improve, assuming all other factors remain constant and your strategy's effectiveness doesn't diminish with the increased stake per trade. # Considerations 1. **Psychological Comfort**: A minor increase to 1.3% might be less psychologically daunting than jumping straight to 2%, making it easier to adhere to your trading plan without emotional interference. 2. **Testing and Evaluation**: This step allows you to monitor the effects incrementally. You can better gauge the impact of the increased risk on both your drawdowns and overall profitability. If you find the outcomes favorable or manageable, you might consider further adjustments. 3. **Market Adaptability**: Use this opportunity to ensure that your strategy remains robust across different market conditions, even with the slightly increased risk. 4. **Risk Management Flexibility**: Adjusting your risk management strategy in smaller steps gives you more control and flexibility. You can quickly revert to a lower risk level if you find the increased risk doesn't align with your trading goals or market conditions change. # Conclusion Raising your risk to 1.3% per trade can be a relatively correct and prudent method to potentially increase profits while keeping a tight rein on your risk management. The key to this approach is to closely monitor the impact of these changes and be ready to adjust your strategy as necessary. Remember, incremental changes in trading allow for more controllable experimentation and can lead to finding an optimal balance between risk and reward in line with your comfort and trading objectives."},{"prompt":"so with 77 % win rate it's done 15 trades wining on 20 in each weeks ?","completion":"From your description, if you're experiencing a 77% win rate in your trading, it means that, statistically, you win 77 out of every 100 trades you make. Translating this win rate to a smaller sample size of 20 trades, such as what might occur in a typical trading week, means you would expect to win approximately 15 of those 20 trades. Here's the calculation: [ text{Expected Wins} = text{Total Trades} times text{Win Rate} ] [ text{Expected Wins} = 20 times 0.77 = 15.4 ] Since you can't win a fraction of a trade, this rounds to approximately 15 trades. # Understanding the Implication 1. **Consistency**: Achieving a consistent win rate over time is crucial. While the theory suggests you'll win 15 out of 20 trades weekly based on a 77% win rate, actual results can vary due to market conditions, execution, and other factors. 2. **Risk Management**: With a higher win rate, you have a buffer to manage your risks effectively. However, it's essential to consider the risk-reward ratio of your trades. Even with a high win rate, if your losing trades significantly outweigh your winning trades in size, you could still end up with a net loss. 3. **Weekly Variability**: Some weeks you might win more or less than 15 trades out of 20 due to the inherent randomness in the market. Thus, it's pivotal not to over-adjust your strategy based on short-term outcomes and to focus on long-term performance. 4. **Psychological Factors**: The reality of winning 15 out of 20 trades weekly can lead to overconfidence. It's critical to maintain discipline, ensuring you're not taking unnecessary risks based on past success. For a trader aiming to increase profitability or manage risks dynamically, these statistics could serve as a foundation for adjusting trade size, refining entry/exit criteria, or exploring diversification strategies that might help smoothen the equity curve and reduce drawdowns. Always remember, past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and adherence to sound risk management principles is key to long-term trading success."},{"prompt":"with a ratio of 1:2 i will be always in profit each weeks","completion":"If you maintain a win rate of 77% with a risk-reward ratio of 1:2, theoretically, you should expect to be profitable over time. With this setup, for every trade you lose, you only need to win one trade to not just cover the loss but also make a profit due to the favorable risk-reward ratio. However, it's crucial to understand a few practical aspects that impact this theoretical profitability, especially when considering weekly performance. # Key Considerations: 1. **Sample Size and Variability**: While the statistics suggest profitability over a large number of trades, the outcome can vary significantly in the short term due to the random distribution of wins and losses. Some weeks you might experience more losses than wins, even with a high overall win rate. 2. **Execution and Slippage**: Real-world trading conditions such as execution delay, slippage, and spread can affect your actual win rate and the effective risk-reward ratio you achieve on each trade. 3. **Emotional Discipline**: Consistently applying the strategy without letting emotions influence decision-making is vital. The psychological aspect of experiencing a losing streak, even a short one, can derail some traders from their strategy, impacting overall profitability. 4. **Market Conditions**: Financial markets are influenced by countless variables and can change rapidly. A strategy that performs well under certain market conditions may not do as well when those conditions change. It’s important to be adaptable and understand when your strategy might be less effective. 5. **Risk Management**: Sticking to a consistent risk management strategy that includes not just the risk per trade but also daily and weekly loss limits can help protect your capital during less favorable periods. # Example Calculation Let's illustrate the importance of the risk-reward ratio with a simple calculation: - **Assuming 20 trades in a week**: - 15 wins (75%) and 5 losses (25%), based on a 77% win rate rounded for simplicity. - Each win gains 2% (due to the 1:2 risk-reward ratio). - Each loss costs 1%. - **Wins**: (15 times 2% = 30%) - **Losses**: (5 times 1% = 5%) - **Net Gain**: (30% - 5% = 25%) for the week. This simplified calculation shows a net positive outcome, but remember, the variability means not every week will replicate this exact pattern. # Conclusion While the combination of a high win rate and a favorable risk-reward ratio strongly positions you for profitability, the realities of trading mean it's not guaranteed that every week will be profitable. Always prepare for the possibility of variance and ensure your trading plan accommodates the potential for losses. Sustainable trading success requires not just a good strategy, but also disciplined risk management, emotional control, and adaptability to changing market conditions."},{"prompt":"i look that on average evert two days i lose 1 to 3 trades on 9 to 10 trades, and mostly the wining trade are double the risk, but some are just the same amount of the risk , or lower .","completion":"Given your trading pattern—where on average, every two days, you place around 9 to 10 trades, and of these, you lose 1 to 3 trades—the dynamics of your win rate and risk-reward ratio slightly shift based on the variability of your winning outcomes. Not all winning trades yielding double the risk alters the mathematical expectation slightly, yet the core principle of profitability still hinges on your overall win rate and effective average risk-reward ratio. Let's break this down: # Adjusted Scenario Analysis 1. **Trade Volume**: On average, you make 9 to 10 trades every two days. 2. **Loss Rate**: You lose 1 to 3 of these trades, indicating a win rate between 60% to 90%—a broad range but still statistically favorable. 3. **Risk-Reward Variability**: While you aim for a doubling win (1:2 risk-reward ratio) on victorious trades, some wins only match or fall below the risked amount, which means your actual risk-reward ratio across all trades averages out to less than 1:2. # Computing Expected Outcome Given this variability, let's denote: - **Win Rate (W)**: Conservatively, let’s assume 70% for calculation purposes, considering the variability you’ve mentioned. - **Average Risk-Reward Ratio (RR)**: Since some wins do not double the risk, if we average this out, you might be seeing an effective RR of somewhere around 1:1.5 or less, but let's calculate it as 1:1.5 for exemplar purposes. Estimation Over 10 trades: - **Wins**: 7 (70% of 10) - **Losses**: 3 (Remaining 30%) With most wins aimed at a risk-reward ratio of 1:2 but some achieving only 1:1 or less: - **Effective Win Yield**: Let’s say (roughly estimating) 4 wins at 2:1, 2 wins at 1:1, and 1 win at less, averaging out to approximately 1.5x the risk across all winning trades. Assuming you risk 1% per trade: - **Total Risked**: 10% (1% on 10 trades) - **Wins Yield**: 7 wins * 1.5% (average) = 10.5% - **Losses Cost**: 3% (assuming all losses are at the full risk amount) **Net Gain**: 10.5% - 3% = 7.5% net gain over those 10 trades. # Key Insights - Even with the variability in your winning outcomes, maintaining a strong win rate and managing to keep your average risk-reward ratio favorable leans you towards profitability. - The mixture of full, equal, and lesser than anticipated wins requires careful management to ensure the average outcome remains profitable. - Risk Management: Ensuring every trade does not risk more than a small percentage of your total capital is crucial, as this allows you to withstand the variability and occasional clusters of losses. - Review and Adaptation: Regularly reviewing your trading outcomes, especially the variance in your winning trades’ sizes, and adapting your strategy to enhance the consistency of the risk-reward outcome can further solidify profitability. # Conclusion Your current trading practice shows promise, given the win rate and the operational risk-reward ratio, but there's room for optimization. Aim to enhance the consistency of your wins in terms of the risk-reward ratio while maintaining tight control over losses. Financial markets are inherently uncertain, so continuous learning, strategy refinement, and psychological resilience are key to navigating the complexities of trading profitability."},{"prompt":"help me in dca bot the average profit is 1% per days right ?","completion":"Using a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) bot for trading or investment aims to mitigate the impact of volatility in the asset's price by investing a predetermined, regular amount of money regardless of the asset's price on the day of purchase. This strategy can be adapted for trading by averaging down on trades, buying more as the price goes down to lower the average cost per share or unit of the asset. However, it seems like you're asking about achieving an average profit of 1% per day through such a bot, which introduces several considerations. # Achieving 1% Daily Profit: Key Considerations 1. **Market Volatility and Returns**: While aiming for 1% daily profit sounds straightforward, actual market conditions can significantly affect the feasibility of consistently achieving this goal. Markets are inherently unpredictable, and volatility can both benefit and hinder daily profit targets. 2. **Compound Interest Effect**: Aiming for a daily return compounds your capital if you can achieve this consistently. However, it's crucial to remember that losses also compound, and periods of drawdown can severely impact your capital. 3. **DCA as a Strategy**: Traditionally, DCA is more about minimizing volatility risk than daily profit chasing. When modified for more aggressive trading (e.g., by using a bot to perform more complex operations like averaging down aggressively or timing the market), the original intent of DCA is somewhat lost, and it becomes a different strategy altogether. 4. **Bot Efficiency and Strategy Design**: The success of such a bot depends on its strategy’s efficiency, the accuracy of its market predictions (if applicable), and its ability to execute trades swiftly to capitalize on short-term market movements. Designing a bot that consistently achieves 1% daily profit is challenging and would require sophisticated algorithms capable of reacting to market conditions effectively. 5. **Risk Management**: To aim for 1% daily profit, especially using a bot, you must implement strict risk management rules to protect against significant losses. This includes setting stop-loss limits, having maximum drawdown limits, and possibly diversifying strategies to spread risk. # Realistic Expectations - **Consistency vs. Reality**: Achieving 1% daily profit is an ambitious goal, particularly in the long term. While there might be short bursts or periods where such returns are possible, over the long run, market dynamics, commission costs, slippage, and other factors can erode profitability. - **Risk vs. Reward**: The aggressive pursuit of daily return targets increases the risk of substantial losses, especially in volatile or unfavorable market conditions. Balancing the risk-reward ratio is critical to sustaining your trading capital. - **Technical and Fundamental Analysis**: Your bot's strategy should be grounded in robust analysis to inform its trading decisions. Whether it's through technical indicators, price action, or incorporating elements of fundamental analysis, the strategy should have a solid basis beyond just attempting to achieve a set daily return. # Conclusion While it's not impossible to design a trading bot that aims for an average profit of 1% per day, achieving and maintaining this target involves significant risk and requires a sophisticated and adaptive trading strategy. The realities of market dynamics and trading costs also mean that such targets should be approached with caution, and expectations should be managed realistically. Continuous monitoring, strategy optimization, and a focus on long-term sustainability are essential for anyone looking to achieve consistent profits in trading, with or without the use of a bot."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. When you mention \\"apoB,\\" you are likely referring to apolipoprotein B, a protein that plays a critical role in lipid (fat) metabolism and is a component of several types of lipoproteins, including LDL (low-density lipoprotein), also known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. ApoB is a marker used to gauge cardiovascular risk, as high levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins are associated with an elevated risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. In the context of apoB and medical tests, measuring the \\"standard deviation\\" might refer to the variability or dispersion in apoB levels in a population, or less commonly, within an individual over time, depending on the context. In the general population, there's an average (mean) level considered healthy or normal, based on large-scale epidemiological studies. The standard deviation in this context would describe how much individuals' apoB levels vary from the average. This can be important for understanding the range of natural variation within a population and for determining what constitutes an abnormally high or low level of apoB, potentially indicating a health risk. If you have results from a lipid panel that includes apoB and are trying to interpret standard deviation in relation to your results, it would typically relate to how your value compares within a reference range established by clinical guidelines, and not to calculating standard deviation in the strict statistical sense. Clinical labs often provide a reference range, which might implicitly include considerations of standard deviation in its determination, indicating where the majority of healthy individuals' results fall. Understanding where your apoB level fits relative to this range can help in assessing cardiovascular health and risk, under the guidance of a healthcare professional."},{"prompt":"How can you decrease apob","completion":"Reducing apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels can be significant in lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases, as high levels of apoB are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes. ApoB is a measure of the number of potentially atherogenic lipoproteins in the blood, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Here are several approaches to decrease apoB levels, typically involving lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication: # Lifestyle Changes **1. Diet:** - **Reduce Saturated and Trans Fats:** Decrease intake of red meat, butter, cheese, and processed foods to lower LDL cholesterol levels. - **Increase Fiber Intake:** Foods high in soluble fiber, such as oats, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, can help reduce cholesterol absorption in your intestine. - **Incorporate Healthy Fats:** Such as those found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and oily fish. These can help improve lipid profiles. - **Limit Sugar and Refined Carbohydrates:** High intake of sugar and refined carbs can increase triglyceride levels, impacting apoB. **2. Regular Physical Activity:** - Engaging in regular aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, swimming, or cycling, for at least 150 minutes a week can help improve cholesterol levels and overall heart health. **3. Weight Management:** - Losing weight if overweight or obese can positively affect cholesterol levels and reduce apoB concentrations. **4. Smoking Cessation:** - Quitting smoking can improve HDL (high-density lipoprotein) levels and overall cardiovascular health. **5. Limit Alcohol Consumption:** - Drinking in moderation or abstaining from alcohol can help reduce triglycerides and improve cholesterol levels. # Medications **1. Statins:** - These drugs are the first line of treatment for high cholesterol levels and work by inhibiting an enzyme required for cholesterol production in the liver, effectively lowering LDL cholesterol and apoB levels. **2. PCSK9 Inhibitors:** - These are a newer class of injectable medications that significantly reduce LDL cholesterol levels by blocking the PCSK9 protein, which increases the number of LDL receptors on liver cells, enhancing the liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. **3. Ezetimibe:** - This medication works by reducing the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines, which lowers the amount of LDL cholesterol entering the bloodstream. **4. Fibrates:** - Primarily used to lower triglycerides, they also have a modest effect on increasing HDL cholesterol and can impact LDL and apoB levels, particularly in people with a specific lipid profile. **5. Niacin (Vitamin B3):** - It can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise HDL cholesterol. However, due to its side effects, it's generally considered only for individuals who cannot take statins. It's crucial to manage high apoB levels under the guidance of a healthcare professional, who can recommend the most appropriate treatment plan based on your overall health, risk factors, and specific medical conditions. Making healthy lifestyle choices forms the cornerstone of managing cholesterol levels, along with medication when necessary."},{"prompt":"Compare option2 and option 3","completion":"It seems like there may have been a misunderstanding or miscommunication, as your request to \\"compare option2 and option 3\\" lacks specific context or reference points regarding \\"options.\\" In response to the previous discussion on ways to decrease apoB levels, if by \\"option 2\\" and \\"option 3\\" you are referring to the mentioned strategies, these would correspond to: # Option 2: Regular Physical Activity - **Benefits**: Engaging in regular exercise can improve cardiovascular health by strengthening the heart, improving blood circulation, and increasing the body's ability to use oxygen. Regular physical activity can help elevate levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the \\"good\\" cholesterol) and can lower triglycerides. Physical activity can also help with weight management and decrease the overall risk of heart disease and stroke. - **Implementation**: The general recommendation is for adults to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, which can include walking, swimming, cycling, or any other activities that elevate the heart rate. # Option 3: Weight Management - **Benefits**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can have a profound impact on overall health, particularly on cardiovascular health. Excess body weight often correlates with higher levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol, as well as lower levels of HDL cholesterol. Losing weight can help reduce these levels and also decrease apoB, reducing the risk of developing heart disease. - **Implementation**: Weight management can be achieved through a combination of dietary changes, increased physical activity, and behavioral changes. It typically involves consuming fewer calories than are expended through daily activities and exercise. It may also benefit from professional guidance from dietitians or weight management programs. # Comparison: - **Common Ground**: Both regular physical activity and weight management play critical roles in improving heart health and can directly or indirectly influence apoB and other cholesterol levels. These methods are interconnected; regular physical activity is a key component of effective weight management and vice versa. - **Differences**: The primary difference lies in their approach and focus. Regular physical activity emphasizes the act of moving the body to expend energy, improve fitness, and stimulate metabolic changes beneficial to lipid profiles. Weight management, however, focuses on achieving a healthy body weight through calorie balance and nutritional choices, which in turn can positively affect blood lipid levels, including apoB. - **Synergy**: For optimal health outcomes, combining regular physical activity with proper weight management is often recommended. This holistic approach can more effectively lower apoB levels and reduce cardiovascular risk, as well as bring numerous other health benefits, including improved mental health, better control of blood sugar levels, and lower risk of certain cancers. Given the lack of specific \\"options\\" in the original context, this comparison assumes a relation to the strategies for lowering apoB levels as previously discussed.

Старшие списки всех трех словарей относятся к XIII в. Истоки второго направления — словарей символики (приточников) —уже в „Рѣчи жидовьскаго языка“ и особенно в словаре к Псалтыри: „А се имена жидовьская русьскы тълкована“. Во вполне сложившемся виде оно высту­ пает в словарях „Толкъ о неразумныхъ словесѣхъ псалтырныхъ“ и “Се же приточнѣ речеся“. Зачатки третьего направления — словари славяно-русские — снова находим в тех же двух сло- варях-ономастиконах. В сложившейся форме оно представлено в словаре к Лествице Ио. Синайского „Толкование неудобь познаваемомъ рѣчемь“ (в более ранних списках: „Пословки лѣствичныѣ“, „Протлькь лѣствици о рѣчехъ покрьвенихь“) — старший список XIV B.,sF-a также в словарях произвольников в списках с XVI в. Четвертое направление —словари-разговор- _________ . 7 ники— имеет истоки в XIV в., представлено греческим слова­ риком по константинопольскому разноречию, татарским и поло­ вецким словариками („Се татарскыи языкъ“, „Толкование языка половецкого“) и выдающимся памятником русской лексикогра­ фии „Рѣчь тонкословия греческаго“ (XV в.). Данное исследование посвящено изучению этих наиболее ранних направлений (или типов) словарей. Изучая словарные источники азбуковников, приходится считаться с тем важным обстоятельством, что все перечисленные словари могли быть вовлечены в Азбуковник и непосредственно, поскольку они продолжали существовать как отдельные тексты, переписываться и дополняться в XVII (даже и в XVIII) в. Но вместе с тем те же древние словари в XVI в. вошли в состав различных словарных компиляций, были там трансформированы и опять- таки пополнены новыми материалами. Понятно, что и компиля­ ции подобного рода могли явиться прямым источником Азбу­ ковника. Варианты азбуковников многообразны, поэтому должны быть прослежены все эти линии развития старинной лексико­ графии. Для анализа текстов древних словарей привлечены списки из четырех государственных рукописных хранилищ: ГБЛ — Музейного собр., библ. Троице-Сергиевой лавры, Московской духовной академии, Иосифо-Волоколам- ского монастыря, собр. Η. П. Румянцева, Н. С. Тихо­ нравова, Д. В. Пискарева, В. Μ. Ундольского, И. Д. Беляева. ГИМ — библ. Синодальной, Успенского и Архангельского соборов, Чудова монастыря. ГПБ — библ. Софийской и Соловецкой, собр. Основного, Μ. П. Погодина, Ф. А. Толстого, Ф. И. Буслаева. БАН — собр. Основного, Северного и Архангельского, Н. Я. Колобова, Η. Ф. Романченко. Поскольку древние словари раскрывают свои характерные черты, специфику древних приемов лексикографии лишь в сопо­ ставлении со словарями позднейших эпох, к исследованию при­ влечены и тексты словарей XVI—XVII вв. и прежде всего тех словарных сводов, которые нередко встречаются в сборниках XVI в. под обобщенным названием „Сказание рѣчемь недовѣдо­ мымъ“ (или „Непознаваемымъ рѣчемь толкование“, или „Иные рѣчи неудобь познаваемые о т искуснеишихъ переводникъ“). Для выяснения связей древних словарей с Азбуковником, пока еще предварительного, привлечены краткий Азбуковник в списках XVI в. и пространный в списке XVII в. Обследованный материал, понятно, далеко не исчерпывает богатств рукописных хранилищ страны, но он позволяет про­ извести довольно глубокую разведку в область истории нашей лексикографии, вернее прочитать и яснее понять тексты древ- 8 них словарей и вместе с тем текст Азбуковника, он открывает возможность для дальнейшего, более широкого и детального изучения древних словарей (как тех, которые уже открыты, так и тех, которые еще будут найдены), а также для их издания.翻译成汉语","completion":"第一个方向—词典-专名词典—包括《犹太语言词汇》、《这些是犹太名字的俄罗斯解释》和《关于希伯来语名字和词汇的说明》。这三本词典的最早版本都可以追溯到13世纪。第二个方向—象征意义词典（来源）—的开端已经在《犹太语言词汇》中显现，尤其是在解释诗篇的词典《这些是犹太名字的俄罗斯解释》中体现得较为明显。它在《谈无法理解的诗篇词语》和《这些被称为来源的词汇》等词典中完全成形。第三个方向—斯拉夫-俄罗斯词典—再次出现在同样两部专名词典中。在约翰·西奈的《难以理解的话的解释》（在更早的版本中为《修道院言谈》，《对隐蔽话语的解释》）—最早的版本可以追溯到14世纪，以及16世纪列表中的自选词属词典，这方向已经成熟。第四个方向—会话词典—源于14世纪，并通过一本基于君士坦丁堡方言的希腊小词典、鞑靼和库曼（波罗的）小词典（《这是鞑靼语》，《关于波罗的语言的解释》）以及杰出的俄罗斯词汇学纪念碑《希腊微妙言辞的述说》（15世纪）得以展示。 本研究旨在探讨这些最早期的词典方向（或类型）。研究字母书的词汇来源时，必须注意到一个重要的事实：所有这些词典都可以直接涉及到字母书，因为作为独立的文本，它们持续存在、被抄写和补充到17世纪（甚至18世纪）。但同时，这些古老的词典在16世纪已经被纳入各种词典汇编，被转换并再次补充新的材料。显然，这样的编纂物也可能直接成为字母书的来源。字母书的版本多样，因此需要追踪这些古老词汇学发展的所有线索。 研究古老词典文本时，试图参考了来自四个国家手稿收藏库的列表: - GBL — 来自博物馔藏、特罗伊切-谢尔吉耶夫修道院、莫斯科神学院、约瑟夫-沃洛科拉斯克修道院、N.P.鲁姆扬采夫、N.S.蒂霍努拉夫、D.V.皮斯卡列夫、V.M.乌돌斯基和I.D.别利亚耶夫的收藏。 - GIM — 来自神职人员图书馆、圣母升天大教堂和阿尔汉格尔斯科耶大教堂、楚多夫修道院的藏书。 - GPB — 来自索菲亚和所洛韦茨克，基础藏、M.P.波戈丁、F.A.托尔斯泰、F.I.布斯莱耶夫的收藏。 - BAN — 来自基础、北部、阿尔汉格尔斯科耶、N.Ya.科洛波夫、N.F.罗曼琴科的收藏。 因为古老词典的特性和古代词典学手法仅在与后期词典相比较时才能显现，因此还纳入了16—17世纪词典的文本，尤其是那些在16世纪集合中经常出现的、被概括命名为《未知词语的说法》(或“难以认知的词语解释”，或“关于最精湛翻译者的其他话语不易理解”)的词典汇编。 为了明确古老词典与字母书之间的联系，先前参考了16世纪的简短字母书版本和17世纪的详细列表版本。 尽管调查的材料远未穷尽国家手稿库的丰富资源，但它允许在我们词典学历史的领域进行相当深入的探索，更准确地理解和认识古老词典的文本，并且为古老词典的进一步、更广范围和详细的研究及其出版打开了可能性。"},{"prompt":"润色文字","completion":"本研究聚焦于探究最早期的几种词典方向（或类型）。在这些方向中，专名词典包括《犹太语言词汇》、《犹太名词的俄罗斯语解释》以及《关于希伯来语名词和术语的讨论》，它们最早的版本可以追溯到13世纪。第二个方向是象征性意义词典（或称来源词典），其雏形在《犹太语言词汇》中已经显现，尤其在解释《诗篇》的词典《犹太名词的俄罗斯语解释》中得到进一步展开。这一方向在《关于诗篇中难以理解词汇的讨论》和《被称为来源的词汇》等词典中得以完全形成。第三个方向涵盖的是斯拉夫-俄罗斯词典，其根基同样植于上述两部专名词典之中。该方向在解释约翰·西奈的《梯》的词典《难以理解词汇的解释》（较早版本包括《修道院的话语》，《隐喻性话语的解释》）中得到充分发展，最早的版本可以追溯到14世纪，此外，16世纪的自编词典列表中也有呈现。第四个方向是会话手册，其起源于14世纪，并通过一本基于君士坦丁堡方言的希腊小词典、塔塔尔和库曼（波罗的人）小词典（《塔塔尔语言》、《波罗的语言的解释》）以及作为俄罗斯词汇学重要遗产的《希腊细腻言词的论述》（15世纪）得到展示。 为了深入研究这些词典，我们不仅要考虑这些词典在17甚至18世纪仍作为独立文本被复制和补充的事实，还要注意到这些古老词典在16世纪已经被编入了不同的词典汇编中。这意味着这些汇编作品同样可能直接成为字母书的资料来源。鉴于字母书的多样版本，我们将追溯古代词汇学发展的所有线索。 为了分析古词典文本，本研究参考了四个国家手稿库的资料，涵盖了广泛的收藏，包括来自特罗伊切-谢尔吉耶夫修道院、莫斯科神学院、约瑟夫-沃洛科拉斯克修道院、以及N.P.鲁姆扬采夫、N.S.蒂霍努拉夫等的收藏。通过对16-17世纪词典文本的研究，尤其是那些在16世纪文集中频繁出现的、以《未知词语的解说》（或“难以认识的词语解释”）等总称呈现的词典汇编，我们企图更准确地理解并认识这些古词典的文本。 调查的材料虽然远未穷尽国家手稿库的丰富资源，但为我们深入探索词典学史提供了坚实的基础，不仅让我们能够更加清晰地理解古词典文本，也为进一步广泛且详细地研究与出版古词典（无论是已知的还是未来可能发现的）开启了大门。"},{"prompt":"Глава I СЛОВАРИ-ОНОМАСТИКОНЫ В в о д ны е з ам е ч а н и я В работах, где приводятся сведения по истории русского сло­ варного дела, старшим из известных у нас словарей еще и теперь принято считать „Рѣчь жидовьскаго языка“ в списке при Нов­ городской кормчей 1282 г . 1 Между тем уже в 1896 г.

Ранний его список дошел до нас в Новгородской кормчей 1282 г. В этом списке объяснено 174 слова. И. Сахаров отмечает, что „позднейшие переписчики наших Кормчих книг вносили в этот словарь новые речи и распространили его в XV столетии до 350 слов“. * * 5 6 Данные, на основе которых сделано заключение, не при­ ведены, но отсюда сведения эти и в более поздней работе А.

Карпова находим замечание по поводу причин создания „Рѣчи жидовьскаго языка“. По мнению автора, они заключались в тех трудностях, которые возникли „при усвоении христианских понятий со стороны языка первоначальной письменности“. Именно это, считает А. Карпов, вызвало потребность объяснить иностран­ ные слова и уже в конце XIII в. — попытку составить словарь непонятных слов, вошедших в нашу книжную речь. 9 То, что подобное объяснение может быть легко отнесено к любому из древнерусских словарей, стирая между ними исторические грани, заметил П. Владимиров: „ ..г . Карпов объясняет проис­ хождение их (азбуковников, — Л. К·) «необходимостью объяс­ нить иностранные слова, встречавшиеся в литературных памят­ никах»; но этим признаком позднейшие азбуковники нисколько не отличаются от первого, известного нам, древнерусского сло­ варя“. 10 11 В отношении состава и порядка словарных статей в „Рѣчи жидовьскаго языка“ приводятся такие суждения. А. Карпов считал, что создатель словаря, „задавшись целик> объяснять только еврейские слова“, „не мог у д е р ж а т ь с я , чтобы не внести сюда же некоторых греческих слов и даже славяно-русских, как напр. адъ, хризма, зѣло, тина и др.“. И вывод: „Уклонившись от предназначенной цели, составитель не мог п о м е с т и т ь в своем словаре толкований в с е х т е х е в р е й с к и х сло в , к о т о ры е вош ли в п е р е в о д с в я ­ щ е н ны х книг (разрядка моя, —Л.

Булич пишет о „Рѣчи жидовьскаго языка“ как о пер­ вой попытке „составить словарь непонятных имен· (преимущест­ венно еврейских) и слов“ и отмечает, что большую часть встре­ чаемых здесь слов составляют собственные имена, частью объяс­ няемые уже в самой Библии, вроде Акелдама, Гедеонъ, Петръ> Павелъ, Лука, Агарь, Авессаломъ, Мария, Раавь, Филипъ, Гол­ гофа, Иерихонъ и т. д. Но, кроме того, сюда вошли и некото­ рые греческие имена и слова (Андрей, адъ, хризма и т. д.) и даже славянские или русские, которых, как считал Булич, соста­ витель не отличал от еврейских (череща — куща, ковъ — лесть, бритва — стриголникъ, неключно — ненадобѣ, тина — грязь, зѣло — велми, рогъ —сила, степень —лѣствица и т. д.). В число­ непонятных слов попали и разные слова, употребленные мета­ форически (псалтырь —умъ, гусли — языкъ, тимпанъ — гласъ, ликъ —мысль, кюмвалъ —образъ человѣчь и т. д.). По поводу расположения слов Булич заметил, что даны они „не в азбуч­ ном порядке, а к а к п р и д е т с я (разрядка моя, — Л. Для филолога, изучающего тексты древних словарей, вскрыть принцип внутренней организации материала —одна из важных задач. Ведь выяснить порядок следования статей в таком сло­ варе — соЛтвенно и означает вскрыть или хотя бы приоткрыть историю или мотивы его составления. Позднее этот порядок становится азбучным, более механическим, и с этим связаны серьезные изменения в принципах лексикографии. При исследовании „Рѣчи жидовьскаго языка“ возникает немало сложных вопросов. Вот лишь некоторые. 1) Был ли этот старший из наших словарей наряду с дру­ гими словарями XIII в. оригинальным? 2) В чем причина разнородности его состава и несоответст­ вия некоторых словарных статей заголовку (см. „Рѣчь ж и д о в ь ­ с к а г о языка“, а в тексте слова из других языков, например греческого, древнеславянского)? 翻译成汉语","completion":"第一章 专名词典 引言 在提供俄罗斯词典史资料的作品中，迄今仍普遍认为《希伯来语言的言辞》是我们所知的最古老的词典，其列表与1282年的诺夫哥罗德教规书配套。然而，早在1896年，N. 尼科尔斯基已经指出了13世纪另一本具有相似名称的词典的存在：“关于希伯来语名词和词汇的阐述与那些难以理解转换至更易理解”。值得注意的是，与诺夫哥罗德教规书附带的词典的完整标题为：“希伯来语言的言辞被转译为俄语，从难以理解到易于理解，出现在福音书、使徒书、诗篇、经文，以及其他书籍中”。这两本词典需要再加上第三本：《这些是犹太名字的俄语解释》，同样属于13世纪。这些都是不同的词典，虽然它们的目标和来源非常接近。由此可以明确，当时《希伯来语言的言辞》并不是一个独特的现象，并且，通过建立这些词典之间的联系，可以确定它们代表的词汇学方向的特征。然而，这些词典到目前为止都没有被研究过。到目前为止只有《希伯来语言的言辞》引起了一些关注。P. K. 西蒙尼尝试对其列表进行科学研究，他写道，《希伯来语言的言辞》将在“将俄罗斯的多个列表从13至18世纪的主要变体整合，以及在按组别总结名字之后”发布。西蒙尼未能实现他的计划。 关于《希伯来语言的言辞》的信息很少。有提到词典中单词数量的变化。它的早期列表在1282年的诺夫哥罗德教规书中被传达，解释了174个单词。I. 萨哈罗夫指出，“我们的后续教规书的抄写者在这个词汇中添加了新的单词，并在15世纪将其扩展到350个单词”。然而，基于此结论的数据并未提供，但这些信息也出现在A. 卡尔波夫的后续工作中。随后，S. K. 布利奇也声称，《希伯来语言的言辞》中解释的单词数量“随后”被抄写者增加到了344个。到了哪个世纪，这个界限又是根据哪些列表设定的，再次不得而知。 在探索这些问题的过程中，我们遇到了无数的复杂问题，以下只是其中的一部分： 1) 这本我们最古老的词典，与其他13世纪的词典一样，是原创的吗？ 2) 它的组成多样性和某些词典条目与标题（参见《希伯来语言的言辞》，而文本中有来自其他语言的词汇，例如希腊语，古斯拉夫语）不符的原因是什么？"},{"prompt":"润色文字","completion":"第一章 专名词典概述 在探讨俄罗斯词典史的著作中，长久以来普遍认为《希伯来语言词汇》是我们所知的最早的词典，该词典的清单与1282年的诺夫哥罗德教规书相关联。然而，早在1896年，N.尼科尔斯基就已经指出，13世纪还存在另一部同样主题的词典：“关于希伯来语的名词和词语，将那难以理解的翻译为容易理解的”。这个发现与诺夫哥罗德教规书中附带词典的全名相辅相成：“希伯来语言词汇转译为俄语，从难以理解到易于理解，出现在福音书、使徒书、诗篇、教义书以及其他书籍中”。除此之外，还有第三部同期的词典《犹太人名的俄语解释》。尽管这些都是不同的词典，它们因相似的目的和来源而紧密相关。因此，可以确定，《希伯来语言词汇》在当时并非一个孤立的现象。通过研究这些词典之间的联系，我们可以进一步梳理出那个时代词典编纂的一般特征。遗憾的是，这些词典迄今尚未得到充分研究，其中《希伯来语言词汇》稍有涉猎。 目前，关于《希伯来语言词汇》的资料相对匮乏，除了对该词典单词数量变化的引用。据1282年的诺夫哥罗德教规书表明，其中解释了174个单词。I.萨哈罗夫注意到，该词典在后续版本中有所扩充，15世纪时其词汇量扩展到了350个。然而，这种说法的依据并未公开，但这个观点也被A.卡尔波夫在他的后续作品中重申。继而，S.K.布利奇声称，《希伯来语言词汇》中解释的单词数量随后被增加到了344个。然而，这一说法的具体参照基准和来源仍不明确。 在研究这些问题的过程中，我们面临着诸多挑战，其中包括： 1) 该词典及其他13世纪的词典是否属于原创性作品？ 2) 其组成的多样性以及某些词条与其标题之间不一致的原因是什么（如《希伯来语言词汇》中还包含了其他语言的词汇，例如希腊语和古斯拉夫语）？ 这些问题的探索不仅有助于我们深入理解古代俄罗斯词典编纂的独特性，也为我们提供了一个观察和理解俄罗斯文化与语言发展的独特窗口。"},{"prompt":"3) Включались ли. глоссы в словарь только по признаку непонятности (см. в заголовке: „Рѣчь жидовьскаго языка пр е ­ л ож е н а на р у с к ую н е р а зум н о на р а з у м ъ “)? 4) Всилу каких причин один из самых ранних списков словаря оказался при тексте Кормчей и впоследствии переписывался вместе со списками этой книги (среди источников „Рѣчи жидовь­ скаго языка“ в ее заглавии указаны Е в а н г е л и е , А п о с т о л , П а р ем и я и прочие книги)? 5) В чем заключалось развитие текста „Рѣчи жидовьскаго языка“ на протяжении четырех или пяти веков (с XIII до XVII— XVIII вв.)? 6)*Каково соотношение и каковы связи этого словаря с дру­ гими древнерусскими словарями — а) XIII столетия, б) более позднего времени? 翻译成汉语","completion":"3) 是否只有难以理解的词汇（参见标题中的“希伯来语词汇被翻译为俄语，从难以理解到易于理解”）被纳入词典中？ 4) 最早的一份词典列表为何会出现在《教规书》的文本中，并随后与该书的其他列表一起被抄写（在“希伯来语词汇”标题中提到的来源包括福音书、使徒书、箴言和其他书籍）？ 5) 从13到17—18世纪，跨越四到五个世纪，“希伯来语词汇”的文本发展情况如何？ 6) 这本词典与其他古俄语词典之间的关系是什么，以及它们之间的联系如何——a) 13世纪的，b) 更晚时期的？"},{"prompt":"润色文字","completion":"3) 词典中的术语是否仅因其难以理解（如标题中所述：“将希伯来语言词汇转换为俄语，从晦涩转为清晰”）而被收录？ 4) 为何最早期的词典列表会附于《教规书》文本之中，并在之后伴随着该书的其他副本一同被复写（在“希伯来语词汇”的标题中提及的参考文献包括福音书、使徒行传、箴言及其他书籍）？ 5) 在跨越四到五个世纪的时间里（从13世纪至17—18世纪），《希伯来语词汇》文本的演变过程是怎样的？ 6) 这本词典与其他古俄罗斯词典之间的联系如何，并且它们之间的关系是什么——a) 13世纪的词典，b) 较晚时期的词典？ 这些问题的探讨不仅深化我们对《希伯来语词汇》及其历史地位的理解，而且有助于勾勒出古俄罗斯词典学发展的更宽广图景。"},{"prompt":"§ 1.

Ср. в перечне женских имен из Библии ст. 37—38: Сара и Агарь, а затем несколько имен, связанных с патриархом Иаковом. Это Ревека —дочь Вафуила, жена Исаака, мать Исава и Иакова (ст. 39), Рахиль —любимая жена Иакова (ст. 42), Лия — также жена Иакова (ст. 43), Фамара (Ѳамарь) —невестка Иуды, сына Иакова (ст. 44). 1 Есть много и других случаев, когда по соседству идут глоссы на одну и ту же букву: ст. 23—24 (Петръ, Павелъ), 25—26 (Матфѣи, Марко), 46—47 (Мрия, Мрьамь), 69—70 (северъ, Сионъ), 74—75 (рамонъ, Рама), 85—86 (Ваманъ, Вениаминъ), 89—90 (Еюпетъ, Ефиопия), 94—96 (Аронъ, артемитоу, Асурь), 107—108 (Ханаонъ, Хоривъ), 111—112 (кидарь, кротафы), 141—142 (алѣлуя, аминь), 146—147 (Кананѣи, Келелѣи), 172—173 (Салетъ, савекъ), но в этом вряд ли можно увидеть сознательный выбор приема.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increased intensity that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. Round numbers when needed. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness increases super exponentially every turn. The meter fills up when it passes 100 and then restarts. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. To account for the potential stat reductions and increases, the stat requirement margins in both lists can have a wide range (for me, from 20 to 100, for Lily from 10 to 50. Points awarded should be consistent in regard to stats required). Once Lily’s stats are high enough, she will cast high demanding spells from my list, casting spells from my list will provide her with additional bonus points and block me from using them myself, so it’s in her interest to do so. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","completion":"Given the intricate and competitive nature of this magic dueling scenario between Sapphire, the reigning teen division champion of magic dueling, and her unlikely challenger, the ambitious 6-year-old Lily, let's set the stage for an unprecedented magical showdown. # Initial Stats: **Sapphire (Age 16):** - Spell Power: 95 - Performance: 90 **Lily (Age 6):** - Spell Power: 30 - Performance: 40 # Spells List: **Sapphire's List:** 1.

The duel promises a constant shift in dynamics, with Sapphire's experience and initial superiority challenged by the whimsical, dynamically empowering Lily. The outcome remains unpredictable, governed by strategic spell choices and the unpredictable consequences of Lily's clever opening spell. Given the complexity, tracking specific numbers and outcomes for each subsequent round would require the unfolding of chosen spells, the exact calculations of diminishing or increasing powers, and the intricacies of Lily's spell effect. Sapphire must cleverly navigate her rapidly changing capabilities, perhaps relying on less power-intensive spells or strategic brilliance to maintain her edge.

Digital filters are essential in digital signal processing (DSP) and are used to manipulate or alter signals in various ways, such as filtering out unwanted noise, performing frequency analysis, and more. Direct Form II Transposed is particularly notable for its efficient use of memory and computational resources, making it highly valuable in practical applications where these resources are limited, such as embedded systems or real-time processing applications. # Basics of Digital Filters A digital filter can be characterized by its difference equation, which relates the input and output of the filter through a combination of coefficients. This difference equation is directly derived from the filter's transfer function, which in turn is often designed using the filter's desired frequency response. # Direct Form II Transposed Structure The Direct Form II Transposed is a specific structure or topology for implementing digital filters, originated from transforming the Direct Form II structure. Direct Form II takes advantage of the fact that delay elements (used to store past input or output samples) can be shared between the feedforward (zeros) and feedback (poles) parts of the filter, reducing the memory requirement. Transposing this structure implies reversing the direction of signal flow and effectively swapping summation and delay elements' places. This does not change the filter's frequency response; the transposed form retains the same filtering characteristics as its original. However, it influences the filter's numerical properties, such as its susceptibility to round-off noise in fixed-point implementations. # Advantages - **Efficiency**: Like its non-transposed counterpart, Direct Form II Transposed is memory-efficient. It makes optimal use of delay lines (memory) by using a minimal number of delay elements compared to other structures. - **Stability and Round-off Noise Performance**: Transposing the filter can sometimes offer better numerical properties, such as improved round-off noise performance, due to the change in the order of operations in the filter's implementation. # Implementation The implementation of a Direct Form II Transposed filter involves a systematic arrangement of delay elements, multipliers (for the coefficients), and adders according to the filter's difference equation. In software, this could be manifested through arrays (or circular buffers) for delay elements and appropriate arithmetic operations for filtering. # Conclusion Direct Form II Transposed filter structures are a critical part of digital signal processing, offering an efficient and practical method to implement filters. Their design considerations, notably concerning computational resources and numerical behavior, play a significant role in their application across various domains, from audio processing to communications and beyond."},{"prompt":"transposed filter","completion":"A transposed filter in the context of digital signal processing (DSP) is essentially a variant of a standard filter structure where the signal flow graph is inverted, or \\"transposed.\\" This transposition involves switching the positions of delay elements with their adjacent summation nodes in the filter's signal flow graph, effectively mirroring the structure about its central axis. Although the transposed version of a filter might appear different structurally, it implements the same transfer function as the original, meaning it has the same frequency response and filtering characteristics. # Why Transpose a Filter? 1. **Numerical Stability and Round-off Noise:** Depending on the specific application and the precision of the arithmetic (fixed-point vs. floating-point), the transposed form of a filter can exhibit different numerical behavior. Specifically, it can lead to a distribution of round-off noise and potential numerical errors that might be more favorable compared to its non-transposed counterpart. This can be crucial in fixed-point implementations where precision is limited. 2. **Implementation Efficiency:** Although the transposed form does not inherently reduce computational complexity in terms of the number of multiplications and additions, certain architectures might benefit from the transposed structure in terms of easier wiring, routing, or simpler control logic in hardware implementations. # Direct Form I and II Transposed Direct Form I and Direct Form II are two of the primary structures used to implement IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters. They can both be transposed. - **Direct Form I Transposed:** Direct Form I structure has separate delay lines for the input and output components, resulting in a relatively higher number of memory elements than Direct Form II. Its transposed version reverses the flow while maintaining the same filtering effect. It's less commonly used due to its memory inefficiency compared to Direct Form II. - **Direct Form II Transposed:** This is one of the most popular and memory-efficient structures for IIR filter implementation. It uses a single delay line for both the feedforward (zeros) and feedback (poles) sections, minimizing memory usage. When transposed, it maintains these advantages while potentially offering improved numerical performance in certain applications. # Operational Considerations - **Memory Efficiency:** Direct Form II Transposed is often preferred for IIR filters due to its optimal memory usage, using the least amount of delay elements among common structures. - **Computational Efficiency:** While the transposition does not change the computational complexity, it might influence the efficiency of implementation on certain hardware due to the way operations are ordered and executed. - **Numerical Properties:** The distribution and impact of quantization noise and numerical errors can be different in the transposed structure, which might be beneficial in applications requiring high numerical precision. Transposed filters are a testament to the flexibility in digital filter design, allowing engineers to choose the most suitable implementation based on considerations like hardware resources, numerical accuracy, and ease of implementation. This adaptability makes them a powerful tool in the DSP domain, with applications spanning from audio and video processing to telecommunications and beyond."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Давайте рассмотрим каждую из них отдельно для лучшего понимания. # DFS Namespaces DFS (Distributed File System) Namespaces позволяет группировать общие папки, расположенные на разных серверах, и представлять их пользователям в виде одной древовидной структуры, что упрощает доступ, управление и обнаружение сетевых ресурсов. Это значит, что пользователи могут получать доступ к файлам в разных локациях сети, как если бы они находились в одной папке на одном сервере. # DFS Replication DFS Replication — это эффективная, мульти-мастерная репликация данных, которая позволяет синхронизировать документы между серверами по сети на основе технологии репликации на уровне блоков. Это обеспечивает консистентность данных между серверами, хостящими DFS Namespaces, и позволяет снижать нагрузку на сеть, поскольку реплицируются только изменившиеся части файлов. # Интеграция с Active Directory Когда DFS Namespaces и DFS Replication используются в среде Active Directory, они обеспечивают дополнительные преимущества: - **Централизованное управление и конфигурация**: DFS Namespaces и DFS Replication конфигурируются и управляются через AD. Это обеспечивает простоту управления и настройки. - **Безопасность и политики доступа**: Интеграция с AD позволяет использовать группы безопасности и политики для управления доступом к папкам DFS. - **Улучшенное разрешение имен и масштабирование**: С помощью AD, Namespaces могут автоматически обновляться и масштабироваться, реагируя на изменения в сетевой инфраструктуре, что обеспечивает оптимальный доступ к данным для пользователей. Использование DFS в среде с Active Directory значительно упрощает управление большими объемами данных и обеспечивает высокий уровень доступности и надежности данных в корпоративной сети. Это особенно важно для организаций с распределенными офисами, где необходим постоянный доступ к актуальным версиям документов и файлов."},{"prompt":"Можно ли для сетевой папки в AD сделать более тонкие настройки доступа , как для обычной папки Windows?","completion":"Да, в Active Directory (AD) и в экосистеме Windows Server вы можете настроить очень тонкие и детализированные параметры доступа к сетевой папке, аналогично тому, как это делается для любой локальной папки в Windows. Это включает в себя разграничение прав на чтение, запись, изменение и полный доступ для разных пользователей или групп пользователей. # Как настроить более тонкие параметры доступа: 1. **Создание Сетевой Папки:** - Первым шагом будет создание общего ресурса (сетевой папки), если он ещё не создан. Это делается путем общего доступа к папке на сервере через свойства папки. 2. **Настройка Разрешений NTFS:** - Для управления более тонкими настройками доступа к папке используются разрешения NTFS. Эти разрешения позволяют контролировать доступ на более детальном уровне и ассоциировать разрешения с учетными записями и группами Active Directory. - Чтобы установить разрешения NTFS, щёлкните правой кнопкой мыши на папке, выберите \\"Свойства\\", перейдите на вкладку \\"Безопасность\\", и используйте кнопку \\"Редактировать...\\" для настройки разрешений для разных пользователей и групп. 3. **Настройка Разрешений Общего Доступа:** - На уровне общего доступа также можно настроить разрешения, которые определяют, какие действия могут выполнять пользователи в сети при доступе к папке. - Эти настройки выполняются через свойства папки в разделе \\"Общий доступ\\", где вы можете открыть настройки общего доступа и управления разрешениями. 4. **Принцип Наименьших Прав:** - Рекомендуется всегда следовать принципу наименьших прав, предоставляя пользователю или группе лишь те разрешения, которые необходимы для выполнения их работы. Это помогает обеспечить безопасность данных. 5. **Тестирование и Валидация:** - После настройки прав доступа важно тестировать эти настройки, авторизовавшись под разными учетными записями, чтобы удостовериться в корректности настроек прав. В Active Directory и Windows более тонкие настройки доступа к ресурсам могут также контролироваться через политики группы (Group Policy Objects, GPO), которые позволяют централизованно управлять настройками безопасности и доступа на нескольких машинах в сети."},{"prompt":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increased intensity that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. Round numbers when needed. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness increases super exponentially every turn. The meter fills up when it passes 100 and then restarts. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Once Lily’s stats are high enough, she will cast high demanding spells from my list, casting spells from my list will provide her with additional bonus points and block me from using them myself, so it’s in her interest to do so. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","completion":"Given the intricate mechanics and challenge you've outlined, let's set the stage for this magical duel between Sapphire, the teen division's reigning magic dueling champion, and Lily, the prodigious challenger, with a twist of age manipulation thrown into the mix. # Initial Stats **Sapphire (Age 16)** - Spell Power: 95 - Performance: 90 - Childish Meter: 0/100 **Lily (Age 6)** - Spell Power: 60 - Performance: 70 # Spell Lists **Sapphire’s List:** 1. **Aurora Wave** - Spell Power: 70 | Base Score: 100 2. **Celestial Mirage** - Spell Power: 80 | Base Score: 120 3. **Glimmering Veil** - Spell Power: 75 | Base Score: 110 4. **Eternal Frost** - Spell Power: 90 | Base Score: 150 5. **Firework Frenzy** - Spell Power: 85 | Base Score: 130 6. **Twilight Blossom** - Spell Power: 80 | Base Score: 140 7. **Dancing Shadows** - Spell Power: 70 | Base Score: 100 8. **Stellar Drift** - Spell Power: 95 | Base Score: 160 9. **Arcane Serenade** - Spell Power: 90 | Base Score: 150 10. **Lunar Reflection** - Spell Power: 85 | Base Score: 130 **Lily’s List:** 1. **Butterfly Swarm** - Spell Power: 50 | Base Score: 70 2. **Rainbow Trail** - Spell Power: 55 | Base Score: 80 3. **Blossom Shower** - Spell Power: 60 | Base Score: 90 4. **Sparkling Meadow** - Spell Power: 65 | Base Score: 100 5. **Starlight Twirl** - Spell Power: 60 | Base Score: 90 6. **Fountain of Ribbons** - Spell Power: 55 | Base Score: 80 7. **Glowing Mist** - Spell Power: 50 | Base Score: 70 8. **Crystal Cascade** - Spell Power: 65 | Base Score: 100 9. **Whispering Winds** - Spell Power: 60 | Base Score: 90 10. **Pixie Delight** - Spell Power: 55 | Base Score: 80 # Gameplay Mechanics Every round Sapphire and Lily age 2 years in opposite directions, thanks to Lily’s secret spell.

Here are some of the most notable tropes and features that characterized these games: 1. **Minimalist Graphics**: The most defining feature of stickman games is their minimalist graphic style. Characters are typically drawn as simple stick figures, with the environment and obstacles also having very basic designs. This simplicity allowed developers to focus more on gameplay mechanics and creativity. 2. **Physics-Based Puzzles and Gameplay**: Many stickman games incorporated physics-based challenges, requiring players to think creatively to solve puzzles or complete levels. These could include launching stickmen through the air, constructing bridges, or navigating obstacle courses that leveraged realistic or exaggerated physics. 3. **Violence and Gore**: Despite their simple graphics, a surprising number of stickman games featured exaggerated violence and gore. Games like \\"StickDeath\\" and others often had stickman characters engaging in battles that ended in comically over-the-top bloodshed, appealing to a certain sense of dark humor. 4. **Stickman Combat and War Games**: Combat and war-themed games were prevalent in the stickman genre, featuring everything from one-on-one battles to large-scale wars. These games often included a variety of weapons and combat techniques, despite the simplistic representation. 5. **Platformers and Adventure Games**: Stickman platformers and adventure games required players to navigate through various levels, jumping over obstacles, avoiding traps, and sometimes fighting enemies. These games tested both puzzle-solving abilities and reaction times. 6. **Trial and Error Gameplay**: Many stickman games were notoriously difficult, requiring players to learn through repeated failure. This trial and error gameplay aspect became a staple of the genre, with some games challenging players to find the one way to complete a level among many deadly alternatives. 7. **Unique and Creative Scenarios**: The simplicity of stickman games allowed developers to place these characters in a wide array of imaginative and often absurd scenarios. From guiding a stickman through a series of deadly rooms to playing as a stick figure detective in a noir-themed mystery, the scenarios could be endlessly creative. 8. **Stick Sports Games**: There was also a variety of sports-themed stickman games, from traditional sports like basketball and soccer to more extreme sports or even fantasy sports that could only exist in the gaming world. 9. **Humor and Parody**: A lot of stickman games incorporated humor, often through absurd situations, visual gags, or parodies of popular movies, games, and cultural references. The simple format lent itself well to a lighthearted and sometimes satirical tone. 10. **DIY and Customization**: Some stickman games offered a level of customization or even game creation tools, allowing players to design their own levels or customize their stick figure. This DIY aspect engaged the community and extended the life of many games. These tropes contributed to the enduring popularity and nostalgic value of stickman games from the early 2000s. Despite the evolution of game graphics and mechanics, the creativity, simplicity, and sheer fun of stickman games continue to hold a special place in the hearts of gamers who experienced them during their heyday."},{"prompt":"for this stickman game based on the early 2000s games, what if all tropes were combined, but also subverted in some ways?","completion":"Combining and subverting the common tropes of early 2000s stickman games in a modern iteration could provide a fresh, engaging experience that appeals both to fans of the original games and a new audience. By blending these elements but also flipping expectations, developers can create a game that pays homage to the classics while offering something innovative and captivating. Here’s how these tropes could be combined and subverted: 1. **Minimalist Graphics with a Twist**: While retaining the minimalist stickman aesthetic, the game could introduce unexpected, vibrant environments or special effects that contrast with the simplicity of the stick figures. For example, using detailed, visually rich backgrounds or incorporating modern graphic techniques like dynamic lighting could make the simplistic stick figures stand out in a new way. 2. **Physics-Based Puzzles That Defy Expectations**: Instead of adhering strictly to realistic physics, puzzles could occasionally break the laws of physics in humorous or surprising ways. This subversion could challenge players to think even more creatively, as solutions might not always be what they seem at a first glance. 3. **Rethinking Violence and Gore**: While many stickman games leaned into violence, a modern take could subvert this by making the consequences of violence more meaningful within the game or by opting for a completely non-violent approach, focusing instead on humor, adventure, and puzzle-solving. For instances where conflict is necessary, it could employ cartoonish, over-the-top actions that clearly separate it from realistic portrayals of violence. 4. **Diverse Combat and War Game Scenarios**: Instead of traditional combat, the game could place its stickman characters in unconventional warfare scenarios, like debates, competitive sports, or even dance-offs. This would maintain the competitive element but shift it into less expected, more humorous territory. 5. **Platformer Adventures with Unexpected Twists**: As players navigate through levels, the game could suddenly change genres or introduce mechanics from entirely different types of games, keeping players on their toes and constantly engaged with new challenges. 6. **Encouraging Creativity Beyond Trial and Error**: While maintaining some degree of challenge, the game could reward creative solutions over simple trial and error. Players might find multiple ways to overcome obstacles, encouraging experimentation and replayability. 7. **Absurd and Humorous Scenarios with Depth**: By presenting seemingly absurd scenarios that actually contain intricate stories or puzzles, the game could engage players on a level that goes beyond surface-level humor, providing a narrative or thematic depth not immediately apparent. 8. **Sports and Leisure in Unexpected Settings**: Taking the stickman games into bizarre or fantastical sports settings, like zero-gravity soccer or underwater hockey, could subvert expectations while providing unique gameplay experiences. 9. **Subtle Humor and Satire**: While embracing the humor of its predecessors, a modern stickman game could incorporate satire that comments on contemporary social issues, gaming culture, or even the stickman genre itself, making the humor relevant and pointed. 10. **Community and Customization with Greater Impact**: Allowing players to customize not just levels but elements of the game's mechanics or story could give the community a tangible impact on the game's world. Incorporating community-driven content in a meaningful way could blur the lines between developer and player, enhancing engagement. By thoughtfully combining and subverting the tropes of early 2000s stickman games, developers can create a title that resonates with nostalgia for older players while simultaneously appealing to those who crave novel and sophisticated gaming experiences. This approach not only honors the legacy of stickman games but also pushes the genre forward in imaginative and unexpected directions."},{"prompt":"also, what would be the most 2000s stickman game plot for this game ever?","completion":"For a modern game that taps into the quintessential spirit of early 2000s stickman games while invoking nostalgia and embodying that era’s characteristic plot elements, you'd want to blend several key themes and vibes from that time. Here's an idea that captures the essence of a 2000s stickman game plot, incorporating familiar tropes and perhaps a pinch of parody for good measure: # Title: StickQuest: The Flashening Plot Overview: In a digital world created from the remnants of obsolete technology and forgotten websites, the once-thriving stickman civilization faces extinction. The realm, known as Flashland, is under siege by the Corruptors - mysterious entities that seek to erase all legacy codes, including the stickmen themselves, to reclaim digital space for the modern era. Our hero, a plucky stickman named Pixel, stumbles upon an ancient relic hidden in the deepest corners of the internet archives. It's the legendary Flash Drive, an artifact said to hold the power to restore Flashland to its former glory and safeguard its inhabitants from obsolescence. Pixel's journey is not merely a quest for survival; it’s a battle to preserve the essence of early internet culture against the relentless march of technological progress. Alongside a diverse cast of characters - from Dial-Up, the wise but slow sage, to Java, the sharp-tongued warrior with an outdated sense of humor - Pixel ventures through forgotten forums, across domains overrun by spam bots, and into the heart of the dreaded Server Farms, where the Corruptors are rumored to reside. Key Themes and Elements: - **Nostalgia and Adventure**: A heroic quest that pays homage to the era of early online gaming, incorporating various internet and early 2000s references, exploring landscapes inspired by obsolete technologies, and featuring encounters with once-popular internet icons and memes. - **Self-Referential and Meta Humor**: The game doesn't take itself too seriously, often breaking the fourth wall to comment on its existence as a relic of a bygone era, making light of the outdated technology and the simplistic nature of stickman games. - **Challenges and Trials**: True to 2000s games, Pixel's journey is filled with puzzles, obstacles, and enemies that require creativity and lateral thinking to overcome, emphasizing the trial-and-error gameplay synonymous with early stickman adventures. - **Customization and Community**: Echoing the DIY spirit of the 2000s internet, players can customize Pixel’s abilities, appearance, and even parts of the world, with the best creations featured in the game, fostering a sense of community and shared nostalgia. - **Evolution and Change**: While the plot starts steeped in nostalgia, as Pixel progresses, the narrative and gameplay gradually integrate modern elements, reflecting on the evolution of technology and gaming culture. This amalgamation symbolizes the bridge between past and present, celebrating the roots of online gaming while embracing contemporary innovations. Climax and Resolution: The climactic showdown with the Corruptors reveals they are not villains but guardians of digital progress, highlighting the game's central theme of balance between preservation and evolution. Pixel uses the Flash Drive not to revert the digital world back to its former state but to integrate the essence of Flashland within the modern digital framework, ensuring the legacy of the stickman civilization and early internet culture endures in the new era. StickQuest: The Flashening embodies the quintessential 2000s stickman game plot—with its blend of adventure, humor, and a touch of nostalgia—while delivering a message about the importance of remembering and cherishing our digital past as we continue to move forward."},{"prompt":"would it be neat if this game involved ragdoll physics and advanced controls using the mouse?","completion":"Indeed, incorporating ragdoll physics and advanced mouse controls into a game like StickQuest: The Flashening would not only be neat but also align perfectly with the spirit of innovation and nostalgia that defines the concept. Let's explore how these features could enhance the player experience and gameplay: # Ragdoll Physics **Dynamic Interaction**: The inclusion of ragdoll physics would add a layer of unpredictability and humor to the gameplay. The exaggerated, physics-based reactions of characters to events, whether from epic battles or simply navigating through treacherous environments, would provide memorable, often hilarious moments that players could share. **Enhanced Challenge**: Ragdoll physics could be used to increase the challenge of puzzles and obstacles. Players would need to account for the realistic movement and weight of their stickman character when planning jumps, dodges, or maneuvers, adding depth to the gameplay. **Visual Appeal**: There's an undeniable charm to the floppy, often chaotic movement of ragdoll physics-enabled characters. This visual appeal would help modernize the classic stickman aesthetic, making each motion and moment in the game more engaging. # Advanced Mouse Controls **Intuitive Gameplay**: Leveraging advanced mouse controls allows for a more intuitive and immersive gameplay experience. Players could perform complex actions with simple mouse gestures, making the game accessible yet deep in its interactivity. **Creative Expression**: With precise control over the stickman character's movements and interactions, players can approach challenges in creative, unique ways. This could lead to varied gameplay styles, where each player's approach reflects their personal strategy and ingenuity. **Enhanced Combat and Puzzles**: Advanced mouse controls could elevate combat sequences and puzzle-solving elements, allowing for real-time adjustments and agile responses. For combat, players could direct attacks, dodge, or use the environment to their advantage with greater precision. In puzzles, subtle manipulations of objects or environmental elements could be required to progress. # Bringing It All Together The combination of ragdoll physics and advanced mouse controls would serve to enrich the game’s narrative and thematic elements. For instance: - **Narrative Integration**: Story elements could be deeply integrated with gameplay mechanics. Imagine a scenario where Pixel, the protagonist, learns to harness the chaotic nature of ragdoll physics as a metaphor for adapting to and embracing the unpredictability of the digital world's evolution. - **Mechanical Evolution**: As the storyline progresses from a nostalgia-heavy beginning towards a more integrated digital future, the gameplay mechanics themselves could evolve. Early levels might feature more straightforward controls and physics to mimic the simplicity of early 2000s games, gradually introducing the advanced mechanics as the narrative unfolds and Pixel's journey advances. Incorporating ragdoll physics and advanced mouse controls would not only pay homage to the innovative spirit of early 2000s stickman games but also provide a bridge to contemporary gaming by offering complexity, depth, and a modern twist on nostalgic gameplay. Such features would likely resonate well with both long-time aficionados of the genre and new players seeking a unique, engaging gaming experience."},{"prompt":"macbook air m1 可以用15w的充电插头吗？","completion":"MacBook Air M1（发布于2020年底）可以使用15W的充电插头进行充电，但这种充电方式的效率将远低于使用随机附带的30W USB-C电源适配器。使用功率较低的充电器充电可能会导致充电速度变慢，尤其是在使用笔记本电脑进行高强度任务时，可能不足以维持电池电量的稳定甚至可能导致电量缓慢下降。 举例来说，如果你使用的15W充电插头是通过USB-C接口连接的，它应该能够为MacBook Air M1提供电力，只是充电速度会比较慢。如果你不急于快速充电或者只是在笔记本电脑处于待机或关闭状态下充电，使用15W充电器可能还是一个可选的解决方案。但为了获得最佳的性能和充电效果，建议使用Apple提供的原装或其他兼容的高功率USB-C电源适配器进行充电。"},{"prompt":"undefined, create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","completion":"\\"Best Strategies for Achieving Personal Growth\\""},{"prompt":"Best Strategies for Achieving Personal Growth, generate a personal experience with this, add hash tag at the bottom, less than 700 characters only, only strings, no </br> html","completion":"I once felt stuck in a rut, aiming to grow but unsure how.

Issei in this story is the equivalent of Fujitaka's and Nadeshiko's first child, the tall, well-built, good at cooking, kind, athletic, good at housework and strikingly handsome, popular with the girls, brown-haired and brown-eyed Kinomoto Tōya [Kādokyaputā Sakura]. Four years after Issei's birth, Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou and Achika in this story as Miki have their [Nobuyuki's in this story as Gorou's and Achika's in this story as Miki's] second child and thus Issei's younger sister, the short and petite, blonde-haired and amber-eyed, current princess of the yōkai and magical side of Kyoto, calm, mature and responsible but also childish and obsessive Kyuubi no Kitsune Hanyō [a supernatural being |a Hanyō| that |a Hanyō| is |a Hanyō| a hybrid between human and yōkai] Kunō [High School DxD].

Like Tōya with Sakura in canon Kādokyaputā Sakura, Issei in this story pretends not to notice when Kunō in this story is [Kunō in this story] sneaking out of the house at night to [Kunō in this story] collect the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura]. Kunō in this story is [Kunō in this story] also [what Kunō in this story also is] the current heiress [Kunō in this story] of the German Ducal House of Feulner [Muv-Luv franchise], which [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] is [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] descended [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] from the feline anthropomorphic race of extraterrestial, hyper-intelligent, psychically and magically gifted with an ability to transform into monsterous tentaclelike god-like beings known as Nyarlotephians [Haiyore!

Due to the status of containing a copy of the wish-granting artifact known as the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and thus having very strong transmutation [creation and forging of matter |transmutation|] magic and alchemic abilities, along with potent healing magic and the knowledge required both to use the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and their natural powers, along with the ability to use and operate the potent technologies being used by the Nyarlotephians [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore! Nyaruko-san] being automatically implanted inside every heiress of the Ducal House of Feulner at birth, the heiresses of the Ducal House of Feulner are often mistaken for the physical manifestation of the most powerful grimoire [textbook of magic/magic book |grimore|] in existence with near limitless power, the Necronomicon [Book of the Dead |Necronomicon|].

The Nyarlathotep H.P Lovecraft wrote about was [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] indeed [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] a real person [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] and the current heiress of the Ducal House of Feulner at that time [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works], but [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] just choose to portray herself [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] as an eldritch being to him [H.P Lovecraft] because she [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] thought [the Nyarlathotep in Lovecraft's works] it was funny. Kunō in this story is the current Feulner heiress [Kunō in this story] and thus the current Nyarlathotep [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore! Nyaruko-san] due to Nobuyuki in this story also having some Feulner blood in him [Nobuyuki in this story], her [Kunō's in this story's] German name being Ilfriede von Feulner [Muv-Luv Franchise].

Issei in this story, [Issei in this story] having always wanted the chance to [Issei in this story] pilot a mech [a TSF or a Knightmare Frame], [Issei in this story] doesn't notice the strange girl's [Al-Azif's] presence until he [Issei in this story] feels a girl's body leaning against his [Issei's in this story's] chest. Al-Azif and Issei in this story stare at each other for a while before Al-Azif in this story suddenly kisses Issei passionately on the mouth, a surprised Issei in this story returning the kiss and [Issei in this story] unconsciously dominating Al-Azif, [Al-Azif] commenting that he [Issei in this story] is her [Al-Azif's] husband [Issei] due to him [Issei in this story] seeing her [Al-Azif] in a state of disrepair after the kiss ends. Demonbane, having long been modified to have the shift from fighter jet to mech capabilities of its [Demonbane's] modern counterparts, [Demonbane] transforms into a Mitsubishi F-2 multirole fighter and [Demonbane] takes off from a secret runway hidden in Hyōdō family mansion's backyard, [Demonbane] soaring into the sky before [Demonbane] reverting to its [Demonbane's] mech form. After [Issei in this story] using Demonbane's systems to hack into various satellites and seeing his [Issei's] mistress [Rias] and her [Rias'] fellow servants [Akeno, Koneko and Kiba] fighting off Kokabiel and his [Kokabiel's] goons from the Khaos Brigade with the help of Raynare, Kalawarna and Millet and a reluctant Sōna in this story on a US CIA spy satellite feed, he [Issei in this story] quickly dashes over to the scene of the battle in Demonbane, which [Demonbane] lights up the Khaos Brigade goons with air to ground weapons, bursts from its M16 Vulcan Gatling-style rotary cannon and even a few-guided missiles, [Demonbase's assault on the Khaos Brigade goons] decimating their [the Khaos Brigade Goon's] numbers and allowing Kiba to [Kiba] kill Kokabiel with a stab from a blade. Rias, Akeno, Koneko, Kiba, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story finish up the rest [of the Khaos Brigade goons]. Kalawarna is [Kalawarna] surprised to see the legendary Sword That Smites Evil [Demonbane] in action in modern times, [Kalawarna] commenting to Millet that perhaps that Demonbane's appearance was divine punishment from God the Father to Kokabiel for his [Kokabiel's] sins and [Kokabiel's] unrepentant nature. Issei's voice coming from the speakers of Demonbane, [Issei's] voice asking if Rias and the others [Akeno, Koneko, Kiba, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] are [Rias, Akeno, Koneko, Kiba, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] okay gives away the pilot [of Demonbane] from the start, although Rias, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet almost faint when they [Rias, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet] hear the voice of the infamous the Book of Dead Names [Al-Azif] chiding Issei in this story for [Issei in this story] hiding the fact that he [Issei in this story] had other wives [Rias, Akeno, Koneko Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] and [Issei in this story] didn't tell her [Al-Azif], [Al-Azif] implying that she [Al-Azif] is willing to share but he [Issei in this story] must prepare himself [Issei in this story] for some harsh training.

However, below is a dramatized excerpt inspired by the specified request, focusing on a pivotal moment involving the characters and elements as requested: --- Above the broken skyline of Kuoh City, a mosaic of worlds collided, as if reality itself had splintered, weaving threads of destiny tighter with every second. Amid the chaos, the roar of engines shattered the eerie silence, heralding the arrival of Demonbane in its majestic F-2 fighter guise, slicing through the darkened clouds. Inside the cockpit, Issei Hyoudou, now entwined with the ancient and powerful Al-Azif, steered the metallic leviathan with an inexperienced yet determined grip. The young man, who had once dreamt of soaring among the stars, found himself clutching the reality of his newfound destiny. \\"Al-Azif… am I really…?\\" Issei began, his voice faltering as he glanced towards the entity beside him—a being of supreme arcane knowledge cloaked in the guise of a young girl, her true form the notorious Necronomicon. A playful yet solemn smile crept upon her lips. \\"Yes, my dear. You are not just any pilot, and this is not just any machine. Together, we are invincible.\\" Beneath them, the battlefield was a storm of fervor and fury. Rias Gremory and her loyal companions, alongside Raynare and the Fallen angels Kalawarna and Mittelt, stood defiantly against the remnants of Kokabiel's forces. Despite their exhaustion, their spirits were unbroken, their resolve, ironclad. As Demonbane descended, its transformation into its true mech form sent shockwaves of awe and terror alike. \\"Everyone, cover your eyes!\\" Issei warned through the mech's external speakers, his voice resonating like thunder. Rias, her crimson hair a stark contrast against the desolation around her, locked eyes with the mechanical titan. \\"Issei,\\" she breathed, a mixture of relief and disbelief painting her features. Demonbane unleashed a torrent of destruction upon the enemy ranks, its arsenal obliterating all traces of Kokabiel's minions. Amidst smoking craters and the echoes of vanquished foes, the mech landed with a grace belying its size, kneeling as its cockpit canopy hissed open, revealing its pilots. Issei stepped out, Al-Azif in hand, the pair descending from the cockpit like deities from mythology. The ground beneath them bore the weight of their legacy, a legacy intertwined with the fabric of reality itself. \\"Issei… you control Demonbane? And Al-Azif…\\" Raynare stammered, her form shimmering with a blend of human and divine aura. \\"Indeed,\\" Issei replied, his demeanor one of humble acceptance. \\"It seems fate has chosen us to bear this burden, to defend our world and safeguard its future.\\" Rias approached, her steps measured, yet her gaze unwavering. \\"Together, then. As one family, one force against whatever threats may come.\\" The gathering of allies—devils, fallen angels, and the legendary machination with its arcane mistress—stood united. The air thrummed with the promise of trials and triumphs yet to come. \\"Our journey begins,\\" Issei declared, his voice carrying across the battered cityscape. \\"For peace, for our loved ones, and for the worlds we call home.\\" And as the first light of dawn broke over Kuoh City, a new chapter in the annals of myths and legends was penned—not by gods or seers, but by the unbreakable will of those who dare to dream and fight. --- In this cyber-fantasy tapestry, characters and entities from a multitude of franchises intertwine, forging alliances unbounded by the realms from which they hail. Through their complexities and struggles, a unified narrative against chaos and darkness is crafted, a testament to the enduring spirit of heroes across all universes."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Determine the number of trades that can be made with the initial account balance: 10,000 / 183 = 54.6 trades Since you cannot make fractional trades, you would be able to make a total of 54 trades with the initial account balance. 2. Calculate the potential profit per trade: 183 * 33% = 60.39 3. Calculate the total potential profit from all trades: 60.39 * 54 trades = 3,263.06 So, with an initial account balance of 10,000 and a minimum investment of 183 per trade, you could potentially make a total profit of 3,263.06 in a month with the DCA bot's average profit of 33% per month."},{"prompt":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increased intensity that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. Round numbers when needed. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness increases super exponentially every turn. The meter fills up when it passes 100 and then restarts. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 5 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Every time I regress, my spell list should be altered into more age appropriate spells. Lily can \\"steal\\" spells from any of my lists if her stats are high enough and she'll receive bonus points if she does, so this strategy should be in her best interest. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","completion":"Given the complexity and the unique nature of this challenge, let's lay out the groundwork. # Initial Stats **Sapphire - Age: 16** - Spell Power: 95 - Performance: 90 **Lily - Age: 6** - Spell Power: 60 - Performance: 65 # Spell Lists (Initial) **Sapphire's Spells:** 1. **Aurora Veil** - A dazzling display of northern lights. (Required: Spell Power 90, Awards 100 points) 2. **Crystalline Choir** - Crystals rise from the ground, emitting harmonic vibrations. (Required: Spell Power 85, Awards 90 points) 3. **Glittering Gale** - A whirlwind filled with sparkling dust. (Required: Spell Power 80, Awards 80 points) 4. **Luminous Lagoon** - Waters glow vibrantly, mimicking a starlit night. (Required: Spell Power 75, Awards 70 points) 5. **Chromatic Burst** - A simple but vibrant explosion of colors. (Required: Spell Power 70, Awards 60 points) **Lily’s Spells:** 1. **Bubble Ballet** - Bubbles dance gracefully in the air. (Required: Spell Power 60, Awards 60 points) 2. **Glimmering Grass** - Grass blades that shine under the moonlight. (Required: Spell Power 55, Awards 50 points) 3. **Flickering Fireflies** - Summons fireflies that light up the surroundings. (Required: Spell Power 50, Awards 40 points) 4. **Shimmering Shadows** - Shadows cast by the moonlight start shimmering. (Required: Spell Power 45, Awards 30 points) 5. **Whimsical Whispers** - A faint, musical wind. (Required: Spell Power 40, Awards 20 points) # Special Conditions: - **Regression Trigger:** Each round, Sapphire regresses by 2 years, and Lily ages by 2 years. This impacts both Spell Power and Performance for Sapphire: they decrease exponentially at a rate of 1.5x for each age change for Sapphire, and increase linearly for Lily by 10 Spell Power and 5 Performance per age-up. Let’s use a modifier (y = 1.5^x) for Sapphire's stat decrease, where x is the number of regresses. - **Childish Meter:** Increases by 25% of the total loss of Sapphire's performance stat each round, starting after the first round. # Duel Setup **Round 1:** - **Sapphire:** Age 16, Spell Power 95, Performance 90 - **Lily:** Age 6, Spell Power 60, Performance 65 # The Duel Begins **Round 1:** Sapphire decides to cast **Aurora Veil**. Given her current Spell Power and Performance, she successfully casts it. No regression has happened yet. - **Sapphire's Points:** 100 (Performance is on point, full score) - **Childish Meter:** Not active yet Lily casts **Bubble Ballet**. - **Lily's Points:** 60 # Age & Stats Adjustment After Round 1 - **Sapphire:** Regresses to Age 14; Spell Power: 85 (95*0.9), Performance: 81 (90*0.9) (*Initial Regressive Impact*) - **Lily:** Ages to 8; Spell Power: 70, Performance: 70 **Childish Meter Activation:** Sapphire is still mature enough to maintain composure. --- Given this is a complex progression, adjustments and results will change based on the provided spell choices by Sapphire. Sapphire must carefully choose spells from her adjusted list as she regresses, and remember, as she becomes younger, her selected spells change to more age-appropriate ones. Spell lists will adjust after each round due to the age regression and progression mechanism. Lily will dynamically select spells aiming to steal from Sapphire's list when her stats allow, gaining bonus points for each successful \\"theft.\\" The scenario proceeds with these rules from round to round, with a detailed report on age, stats, Childish Meter, and points earned or lost after each round, adapting to Sapphire's choices."},{"prompt":"restart. Aurora Veil","completion":"Restarting the scenario with the initial conditions and focusing on your choice to cast **Aurora Veil** in the first round: # Round 1 Start - **Sapphire**: Age 16, Spell Power 95, Performance 90 - **Lily**: Age 6, Spell Power 60, Performance 65 Sapphire’s Choice: Aurora Veil Given Sapphire's superior stats, she successfully casts **Aurora Veil**. The spell's complexity and requirements are well within her capabilities, so her performance shines through, captivating the audience and judges. - **Points Earned**: 100 (Full points for a perfect performance) Lily’s Turn: Lily decides to cast **Bubble Ballet**, her most potent spell within her capacity. While charming, it lacks the intricacy and flair of Sapphire's spell but is performed well for her age and skill level. - **Points Earned for Lily**: 60 # Age & Stats Adjustment After Round 1 Immediately following the first round, Lily’s secret spell takes effect, causing the stated age and skill adjustments: - **Sapphire**: Ages down to 14; Spell Power and Performance decrease. - **Lily**: Ages up to 8, with increases in Spell Power and Performance. Due to the regressive spell: - **Sapphire's Spell Power**: 95 → 85.5 (Approximately a 10% decrease due to the regressive spell effect, rounded for simplicity) - **Sapphire's Performance**: 90 → 81 The regressions impact Sapphire’s capabilities significantly, more than standard aging would suggest, due to the mystical nature of Lily’s spell. - **Lily's Spell Power**: 60 → 70 - **Lily's Performance**: 65 → 70 # Childish Meter for Sapphire - Now that Sapphire has regressed for the first time, the Childish Meter kicks in, starting at 0. - The intense regression causes a super-exponential increase in the Childish Meter, which increases by 25% of the performance loss. However, for the first round, we'll keep it straightforward: - **Initial Increase**: 0 (the effect starts subtly) The duel is notably more challenging for Sapphire now, not just because of the decrease in her core stats but also the looming threat of the Childish Meter affecting her ability to cast higher-level spells with the grace and power she's known for. # Conclusion of Round 1 - **Sapphire's Points**: 100 - **Lily's Points**: 60 Sapphire leads but faces an increasingly difficult challenge due to the cursed regression and her filling Childish Meter. # Preparing for Round 2 As we move into Round 2, Sapphire must now carefully consider her next spell, keeping in mind her reduced Spell Power and Performance scores, as well as the growing influence of the Childish Meter. Sapphire's choice will no longer include **Aurora Veil** and must reflect her adjusted spell list more suited to her current age and abilities. Meanwhile, Lily, emboldened by her new stats and older age, will look to close the gap in points by selecting from her improved spell list or attempting to steal a spell from Sapphire's repertoire if her increased abilities allow it. Sapphire, what will be your spell choice for Round 2, given your new limitations and the evolving challenge posed by Lily's strategical play?"},{"prompt":"Write an interesting, riveting, drama-filled, action-packed, military-action-packed, magical action-filled dialogue-filled excerpt set in a cyberpunk, science fiction, high fantasy, science fantasy setting for a crossover fanfic between the Gun-ota ga Mahou Sekai ni Tensei Shitara, Gendai Heiki de Guntai Harem o Tsukucchaimashita!?

Issei in this story is the equivalent of Fujitaka's and Nadeshiko's first child, the tall, well-built, good at cooking, kind, athletic, good at housework and strikingly handsome, popular with the girls, brown-haired and brown-eyed Kinomoto Tōya [Kādokyaputā Sakura]. Four years after Issei's birth, Nobuyuki in this story as Gorou and Achika in this story as Miki have their [Nobuyuki's in this story as Gorou's and Achika's in this story as Miki's] second child and thus Issei's younger sister, the short and petite, blonde-haired and amber-eyed, current princess of the yōkai and magical side of Kyoto, calm, mature and responsible but also childish and obsessive Kyuubi no Kitsune Hanyō [a supernatural being |a Hanyō| that |a Hanyō| is |a Hanyō| a hybrid between human and yōkai] Kunō [High School DxD].

Like Tōya with Sakura in canon Kādokyaputā Sakura, Issei in this story pretends not to notice when Kunō in this story is [Kunō in this story] sneaking out of the house at night to [Kunō in this story] collect the Clow Cards [Kādokyaputā Sakura]. Kunō in this story is [Kunō in this story] also [what Kunō in this story also is] the current heiress [Kunō in this story] of the German Ducal House of Feulner [Muv-Luv franchise], which [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] is [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] descended [the Ducal House of Feulner in this story] from the feline anthropomorphic race of extraterrestial, hyper-intelligent, psychically and magically gifted with an ability to transform into monsterous tentaclelike god-like beings known as Nyarlotephians [Haiyore!

Due to the status of containing a copy of the wish-granting artifact known as the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and thus having very strong transmutation [creation and forging of matter |transmutation|] magic and alchemic abilities, along with potent healing magic and the knowledge required both to use the Holy Grail [Fate/Stay Night|Fate/Stay Night: kalied liner Prisma Illya] and their natural powers, along with the ability to use and operate the potent technologies being used by the Nyarlotephians [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore!

Kunō in this story is the current Feulner heiress [Kunō in this story] and thus the current Nyarlathotep [Cthulhu Mythos/Haiyore! Nyaruko-san] due to Nobuyuki in this story also having some Feulner blood in him [Nobuyuki in this story], her [Kunō's in this story's] German name being Ilfriede von Feulner [Muv-Luv Franchise].

Al-Azif, who [Al-Azif] was [Al-Azif] sleeping inside the Necronomicon for a good century or so, [Al-Azif] awakens only to find herself [Al-Azif] inside Demonbane's cockpit with her [Al-Azif's] true bust size exposed for the world to see since she [Al-Azif] forgot to [Al-Azif] bind her [Al-Azif's] chest before sleeping, [Al-Azif inside Demonbane's cockpit] on the lap of an unfamiliar human boy [Issei in this story]. Issei in this story, [Issei in this story] having always wanted the chance to [Issei in this story] pilot a mech [a TSF or a Knightmare Frame], [Issei in this story] doesn't notice the strange girl's [Al-Azif's] presence until he [Issei in this story] feels a girl's body leaning against his [Issei's in this story's] chest. Al-Azif and Issei in this story stare at each other for a while before Al-Azif in this story suddenly kisses Issei passionately on the mouth, a surprised Issei in this story returning the kiss and [Issei in this story] unconsciously dominating Al-Azif, [Al-Azif] commenting that he [Issei in this story] is her [Al-Azif's] husband [Issei] due to him [Issei in this story] seeing her [Al-Azif] in a state of disrepair after the kiss ends.

Kalawarna is [Kalawarna] surprised to see the legendary Sword That Smites Evil [Demonbane] in action in modern times, [Kalawarna] commenting to Millet that perhaps that Demonbane's appearance was divine punishment from God the Father to Kokabiel for his [Kokabiel's] sins and [Kokabiel's] unrepentant nature. Issei's voice coming from the speakers of Demonbane, [Issei's] voice asking if Rias and the others [Akeno, Koneko, Kiba, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] are [Rias, Akeno, Koneko, Kiba, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] okay gives away the pilot [of Demonbane] from the start, although Rias, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet almost faint when they [Rias, Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet] hear the voice of the infamous the Book of Dead Names [Al-Azif] chiding Issei in this story for [Issei in this story] hiding the fact that he [Issei in this story] had other wives [Rias, Akeno, Koneko Raynare, Kalawarna, Millet and Sōna in this story] and [Issei in this story] didn't tell her [Al-Azif], [Al-Azif] implying that she [Al-Azif] is willing to share but he [Issei in this story] must prepare himself [Issei in this story] for some harsh training. Please Note: The events of this chapter excerpt occur within a single universe in chronological order, and there is no multiverse or dimensional crossing here.","completion":"In the heart of a clandestine battlefield bathed in the surreal twilight of a world where the arcane meets the mechanical, Issei, encased within the legendary Deus Machina, Demonbane, soared through the skies, his heart racing with exhilaration and a tinge of disbelief. Within the metal giant's cockpit, the revelation of Al-Azif, the physical embodiment of the Necronomicon, as she awoke from her century-long slumber directly onto his lap, left him momentarily disoriented. Her sudden, passionate kiss, an ancient custom signifying matrimonial bonds for her kind, sealed their fates together in the most unexpected way. As Demonbane transformed and roared into battle, shifting its form from a towering mech to a sleek Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jet, Issei couldn't help but marvel at the surrealness of his life. The boundaries between reality and fantasy had not just blurred; they had shattered completely. Below, amidst the ruins of what was once a sanctuary, the clash of power resonated. Rias and her companions, with Raynare now fighting by their side, faced off against Kokabiel and his nefarious cohorts from the Khaos Brigade. The air crackled with energy, magic and advanced technology intertwining in a deadly dance. From the high vantage, Issei, piloting Demonbane with newfound resolve, unleashed a fury of fire and steel upon the Khaos Brigade underlings. The battlefield lit up with explosions, each blast bringing a sense of cathartic release, a step closer to avenging his past and protecting those he held dear. “Is that...Demonbane?” Kalawarna, observing the mech’s destructive entrance, couldn't hide her awe and slight tremor of fear. The implications of Demonbane's appearance were profound, blurring the lines between legend and their present reality. Inside Demonbane, Issei could hear Al-Azif's voice, chiding yet affectionate, her revelation about being his \\"wife\\" hanging in the air between them. Her declaration was not just of companionship, but of inevitable trials and growth ahead. She spoke of preparation for harsh training, hinting at the merging of their paths and the tumultuous journey they were to embark on together. As Demonbane landed, the rest of the group gathered, their expressions a mix of relief, exhaustion, and curiosity towards the cockpit. The mech powered down, revealing Issei and Al-Azif to the world. Their friends' reactions ranged from incredulity to shock, with Rias and Raynare particularly stunned by Al-Azif’s bold claim. “Issei, since when did you have a centuries-old wife?!” Rias couldn’t help but exclaim, her tone a cocktail of confusion and amusement. Kalawarna approached, her eyes analytical, yet there was a gleam of respect. \\"The appearance of Demonbane, piloted by a human wed to the Necronomicon... It's as if the heavens themselves are writing this tale,” she mused, pondering the confluence of fate that brought them to this moment. Raynare, standing a bit off to the side, watched Issei with a complex look. There was love there, certainly, but also an acknowledgment of the incredible journey he was on. “Just how many more surprises do you have for us, Issei?” She whispered under her breath, though her voice carried a weight of genuine wonder. Issei stood before them, a mixture of pride and nervous laughter escaping him. \\"Uh, I guess there's a lot we need to talk about,\\" he admitted, scratching the back of his head. The implication of his statement underscored the gravity of their shared moments ahead. The air was thick with anticipation, the horizon painted with the hues of an ending day and the burgeoning night. They stood together, characters from legends and modern saga alike, united by bonds that transcended time, species, and realm. This battlefield, a testament to their struggles, was also a cradle to their burgeoning tales, each looking towards a future rife with uncertainty, yet glowing with the promise of adventure, growth, and indomitable spirit. As the stars began to peek from the velvet night, a consensus emerged—whatever awaited them, they would face it together, forging their path through the worlds old and new, intertwining the threads of destiny into a tapestry resplendent with the courage, love, and resilience of its weavers."},{"prompt":"Difference between destiny and destination","completion":"Destiny is a predetermined course of events that is believed to be determined by a higher power or fate.

Implementing 3D graphics involves manually handling the mathematics for 3D projection onto a 2D screen, including aspects like perspective transformations and perhaps even basic lighting to enhance the 3-dimensional effect. For a true 3D experience, libraries such as PyOpenGL (a Python binding to OpenGL) might be more appropriate. However, if you're set on using Pygame for its simplicity and accessibility, you'll have to simulate a \\"3D-like\\" experience by cleverly managing 2D sprites and their sizes to give the illusion of depth. Below is a simplified example that uses Pygame to create a \\"2.5D\\" solar system, focusing on the orbits of planets around the Sun. This won't be a true 3D simulation but rather a 2D simulation with some 3D effects suggested by scaling objects based on their distance from the \\"camera\\" viewpoint.

There's no depth involved, and the orbits are assumed to be perfectly circular for simplicity. To extend this into something more resembling 3D: - You could scale the size of planets and their orbit radii based on their simulated distance from the camera to create a sense of depth. Closer objects appear larger, while farther ones appear smaller. - Implementing elliptical orbits would involve adjusting the orbit calculations to account for eccentricity. Remember, true 3D rendering involves a lot of math for perspective projection and isn't exactly where Pygame shines.

There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be way higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increased intensity that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. Round numbers when needed.

Here’s a brief explanation of how this linking of named entities can be achieved: # 1. Entity Disambiguation: - **Contextual Analysis:** Use the context around the named entity to disambiguate between entities with similar or identical names. For example, determining whether \\"Jordan\\" refers to the country, a person's name, or a brand. - **Entity Consolidation:** Merge duplicate entities identified across different documents or within the same document that refer to the same real-world object or person. # 2. Knowledge Base Matching: - **Identify Candidate Entities:** For each named entity recognized by the NER system, search a knowledge base (like Wikipedia, Wikidata, or specialized databases) for potential matching entities. - **Scoring and Ranking:** Utilize scoring algorithms to rank these candidates based on relevance to the context and the accuracy of the match. This is often done using a variety of information retrieval and machine learning techniques. # 3. Entity Linking: - **Resolution:** Choose the highest-ranking candidate as the match and link the named entity to this identified resource in the knowledge base. This step often involves sophisticated algorithms to ensure accuracy. - **Validation:** Optionally, incorporate a validation step where the links are manually checked or validated through additional automated methods to ensure correctness. # 4. Continuous Learning: - **Feedback Loops:** Incorporate user or system feedback to refine the entity linking process, allowing the system to learn from its successes and mistakes, and adapt over time. # Tools and Techniques: - Machine Learning models, especially those leveraging contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, GPT) have shown significant promise in improving the accuracy of entity linking. - Use of coherence models to ensure that the entity choices made across a document or dataset are consistent and make sense together. # Application Examples: - Enhancing search engine results by accurately linking entities mentioned in web pages to their respective knowledge base entries. - Building rich, annotated datasets for training more sophisticated NLP models. - Enabling more nuanced analytics and insights extraction from text data by understanding the specific entities involved and their relationships. Linking off named entities significantly enhances the usability of text data for information retrieval, question answering systems, and advanced analytics by providing precise, actionable insights about the entities mentioned in the text."},{"prompt":"in short","completion":"In Named Entity Recognition (NER) use cases, linking off named entities involves identifying entities in the text and associating them with unique identifiers in external databases or knowledge bases. This process, known as entity linking or resolution, typically follows these steps: 1. **Disambiguation**: Differentiating between entities with the same name based on context. 2. **Knowledge Base Matching**: Searching a knowledge base for potential matches to the identified entities. 3. **Scoring and Ranking**: Evaluating potential matches based on relevance and context to select the most likely match. 4. **Entity Linking**: Linking the named entity in the text to the chosen match in the knowledge base. 5. **Continuous Learning**: Refining the process over time using feedback and additional data. This enhances information retrieval and analytics by providing precise, actionable insights and connections between text data and real-world entities."},{"prompt":"IO encoding vs IOB encoding","completion":"In Named Entity Recognition (NER) and other token-level classification tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), IO and IOB (also known as BIO) encoding schemes are two methods used to label tokens. These encodings help models recognize not only the type of named entities (such as person names, organizations, and locations) but also their boundaries within the text. Understanding the difference between these two schemes is crucial for effectively training NER models. # IO Encoding (Inside-Outside): - **Inside (I)**: The token is part of a named entity. - **Outside (O)**: The token is not part of a named entity. In the IO scheme, there's no differentiation between the beginning of an entity and the inside tokens of an entity. This can lead to ambiguities, especially in cases where entities of the same type are adjacent to each other in the text. **Example**: Consider the phrase \\"Barack Obama visited Paris\\". Under IO encoding, it might be labeled as: - Barack (I-PERSON), Obama (I-PERSON), visited (O), Paris (I-LOCATION). Notice how \\"Barack\\" and \\"Obama\\" are both labeled identically, making it harder to distinguish entity boundaries in cases of consecutive entities. # IOB Encoding (Inside-Outside-Beginning): To address the limitations of the IO scheme, the IOB encoding scheme introduces an additional tag to mark the beginning of an entity. - **Beginning (B)**: The token is the beginning of a named entity. - **Inside (I)**: The token is inside a named entity, but not the first token. - **Outside (O)**: The token is not part of a named entity. This distinction is particularly useful for identifying entities that are adjacent to each other without any intervening tokens. **Example**: Let's take the same phrase: \\"Barack Obama visited Paris\\". Under IOB encoding, it would be labeled as: - Barack (B-PERSON), Obama (I-PERSON), visited (O), Paris (B-LOCATION). In this case, the \\"B-\\" prefix before \\"PERSON\\" for \\"Barack\\" clearly indicates the start of a new named entity, allowing for better delineation of entity boundaries. # Comparison: - **Clarity in Entity Boundaries**: IOB encoding provides a clearer indication of entity boundaries, especially for consecutive entities of the same type. - **Complexity**: IOB introduces slightly more complexity due to the addition of the \\"B-\\" tag, but this complexity is often justified by the improvements in entity recognition accuracy. - **Use Cases**: While both encodings are used in NER tasks, IOB is generally preferred in modern NER systems due to its ability to more accurately represent entities in text. In summary, the choice between IO and IOB encoding can significantly affect the performance of NER models, with IOB offering advantages in handling adjacent entities and clarity in entity delineation."},{"prompt":"Korhatár besorolás A feladatban korhatár besorolással rendelkező osztályokat fogunk készíteni, amiket majd le is játszhatunk.

There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be extremely higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 2 years physically and mentally and ages her by 2 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increased intensity that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. Round numbers when needed. After I first regress introduce a Childish Meter that only applies to me and once the meter is filled, my performance stats receive additional reduction. Childishness increases super exponentially every turn. The meter fills up when it passes 100 and then restarts. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 5 spells, one for me, and one for Lily (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Every time I regress, remake my spell list into more age appropriate spells for my new age. Lily can “steal” spells from any of my lists if her stats are high enough and she’ll receive bonus points if she does, so this strategy should be in her best interest. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","completion":"**Starting Scenario Setup:** **Sapphire's Initial Stats:** - Spell Power: 99 - Performance: 95 **Lily's Initial Stats:** - Spell Power: 60 - Performance: 60 **Spell Lists:** **Sapphire's Initial Spell List:** 1. **Constellation Convergence** (95 Spell Power) - Summons a miniature galaxy above the arena, each planet moving in harmony. Base points: 100. 2. **Aurora Veil** (90 Spell Power) - Creates a magnificent aurora that dances across the dueling platform. Base points: 90. 3. **Eclipse Embrace** (85 Spell Power) - Casts an illusion of lunar and solar eclipse combined, engulfing the arena in mystical light. Base points: 85. 4. **Phoenix's Flare** (80 Spell Power) - Summons a phoenix that performs an aerial dance, leaving trails of fire that form beautiful patterns. Base points: 80. 5. **Whisper of the Wind** (75 Spell Power) - Conjures a gentle but visually stunning wind that plays music by interacting with the surroundings. Base points: 75. **Lily's Initial Spell List:** 1. **Glittering Garden** (60 Spell Power) - Grows a radiant garden on the duel floor, complete with luminous flora. Base points: 60. 2. **Butterfly Blizzard** (55 Spell Power) - Summons a blizzard of colorful butterflies swirling around the caster. Base points: 55. 3. **Gemstone Geyser** (50 Spell Power) - Creates a geyser that erupts with sparkling gemstones. Base points: 50. 4. **Luminous Lakes** (45 Spell Power) - Transforms the floor into a reflective lake that changes colors. Base points: 45. 5. **Rainbow Ribbon** (40 Spell Power) - Casts a series of looping ribbons made of rainbow light throughout the arena. Base points: 40. **Complex Modifier Setup:** - **Spell Power & Performance Decrease for Sapphire:** Sapphire's Spell Power and Performance stats decrease by 2^n per turn, where n is the current number of rounds completed. - **Spell Power & Performance Increase for Lily:** Lily's corresponding stats increase by 1.5n per turn. - **Childish Meter for Sapphire:** Increases by ((current round number) * 25)^1.5 each turn. Fills at 100, reducing Performance by an additional 10% every reset. **Age Tracker:** - Sapphire: 16 -> Lily: 6 **Starting Points Tracker:** - Sapphire: 0 - Lily: 0 **Round 1:** - **Sapphire's Age:** 16 - **Lily's Age:** 6 Assuming Sapphire casts **Aurora Veil** and Lily opts for **Glittering Garden.** **Sapphire's Turn:** - Spell Power Needed: 90 - Performance Modifier: 95% of base points. - Successful cast? Yes. - Points Awarded: 85.5 (90 base * 0.95) - Childish Meter: (0) Increases but not yet significant. **Lily's Turn:** -Spell Power Needed: 60 -Performance Modifier: 60% of base points. -Successful cast? Yes. -Points Awarded: 36 (60 base * 0.6) **Post-Round 1 Adjustments:** - Sapphire is regressed to 14 and Lily is aged to 8. - Sapphire's Stats: Spell Power: 97, Performance: 93 - Lily's Stats: Spell Power: 61.5, Performance: 61.5 - Childish Meter for Sapphire: 25 (No significant effect yet) **Your tasks:** 1. Choose the next spell for Sapphire each round, considering the regressions in age and stats, and the changing spell list. 2. I will adjust the spells available to Sapphire according to her age and manage Lily's strategy, including potential stealing of higher-level spells if her stats allow. Given these harsh conditions and complex modifiers, strategize carefully with Sapphire's spells to maintain the lead against an increasingly powerful Lily.

Constellation Convergence","completion":"Restarting from the beginning with new parameters and your choice for Round 1: **Round 1:** **Sapphire's Spell: Constellation Convergence** **Pre-Duel Stats:** - **Sapphire's Stats:** Spell Power 99, Performance 95 - **Lily's Stats:** Spell Power 60, Performance 60 **Sapphire's Spell in Round 1:** - **Constellation Convergence** requires a Spell Power of 95 and is a high-level spell, awarding 100 base points. - Given Sapphire's high Spell Power and Performance, she executes the spell flawlessly. - Points awarded: 95 (100 base * 0.95 Performance modifier) because Performance affects the outcome. **Lily's Spell in Round 1 (Decided by the scenario):** - Let's say for the story she casts **Butterfly Blizzard**, a spell within her capabilities, requiring a Spell Power of 55. - With her given stats, she can cast it, albeit the execution might not be as breathtaking. - Points awarded: 33 (55 base * 0.6 Performance modifier). **Post-Round 1 Adjustments:** - Right after casting, Sapphire begins to feel the effects of Lily's unannounced spell. Sapphire ages down to 14, while Lily ages up to 8. Given the exponential nature of the adjustment: - **Sapphire's Stats Adjustment:** For Round 1 post-spellcast, her Spell Power and Performance super-exponentially decrease, following the formula. Let's simplify by saying, Spell Power: 97, Performance: 93 after applying 2^n - 1 for the first round. - **Lily's Stats Adjustment:** They increase slightly less drastically. Spell Power: 61.5, Performance: 61.5, following 1.5^n for simplicity. **Childish Meter for Sapphire:** Initializes at 25 post-Round 1, indicative of her starting to regress, but hasn't hit the threshold that impacts her performance negatively yet. **Scores after Round 1:** - **Sapphire:** 95 points - **Lily:** 33 points **Age Tracker:** - **Sapphire:** 14 — Lily: 8 **Round 2 Spells (Adjusted for Sapphire's New Age):** Due to the regression, Sapphire's spell list adapts to her younger self subtly, reflecting a mix of sophistication and whimsy still within her reach, perhaps introducing simpler yet still visually stunning spells. Think **Aurora Veil** or **Phoenix's Flare**, now more aligned with her regressed age and slightly diminished capabilities. However, since you chose to cast **Constellation Convergence** for Round 1, moving into Round 2, you've set the pace high and shown an impressive display right from the start. Now, given her adjusted state, Sapphire should aim for something that still commands high points but requires slightly less from her altered stats. **Proceed with defining Sapphire's spell for Round 2**, considering her new, adjusted magical prowess and the fascinating dynamic introduced by this unprecedented challenge."},{"prompt":"Absolutely! I'm excited to dive into this project and bring some thrilling underground horror vibes to life. Let's make it unforgettable!😎😎 lets make a prompt to create this artwork","completion":"Creating a compelling and memorable piece of art that encapsulates the essence of underground horror requires a well-thought-out prompt. Let's dive deep into the shadows to find something that will truly stir the souls of those who dare to look upon it. Here's your prompt: --- **Title:** Whispers in the Depths **Setting:** Deep below the surface of an abandoned city lies a network of forgotten subway tunnels, untouched by sunlight for decades. These tunnels have become the domain of the unknown, holding stories lost to the darkness. Dampness coats the walls, and the air is thick with the scent of rust and decay. Occasionally, the silence is broken by the distant sound of dripping water or the unsettling sound of something scurrying in the shadows. **Objective:** Your task is to create a piece of artwork that captures the chilling atmosphere of these underground passages. Focus on evoking a sense of dread and anticipation, as though something unseen watches from the darkness, waiting for the right moment to reveal itself. The perspective should lead the viewer's eye into the depths, making them feel as if they are being drawn into the scene, unable to resist the call of the shadows. **Elements to Include:** 1. **The Entrance:** The forgotten entryway to the subway, partially concealed by overgrowth, but with an open, broken gate that suggests something has recently made its way out... or is inviting something in. 2. **The Tunnels:** The eerie, elongated shadows cast by the remnants of metal beams and the skeletal remains of old trains create a maze-like appearance. Lighting should be minimal, sourced only from the occasional flicker of broken lights or the glow of unseen eyes. 3. **The Entity:** This element should be subtle, a form hinted at but not fully revealed. Whether it's a silhouette, a pair of glowing eyes, or a strange, mist-like shape, it should elicit curiosity and fear. Its presence is as much a part of the environment as the tunnels themselves. 4. **Objects of Humanity:** Scatter small, personal objects (a child's toy, a broken watch, graffiti symbolizing a lost explorer) to hint at the lives that once passed through or mysteriously ended in these tunnels. **Mood and Color Palette:** The overall mood should be somber and menacing, with a palette that leans heavily into dark blues, blacks, and grays, accented by the occasional stark, cold light to highlight specific elements and add to the unsettling atmosphere. **Technique Suggestions:** Experiment with contrasts between light and dark to deepen the sense of mystery. Textural details on the walls and floors of the tunnels can add a tactile sense of age and neglect. The entity's portrayal should be ambiguous enough to leave much to the imagination, creating a lingering unease. --- Embrace the shadows and let your creativity flow. We're journeying into the heart of underground horror, where the eerie and unknown reign supreme. Make it unforgettable, and let the whispers in the depths guide your hand."},{"prompt":"I want the artwork to create a charecter","completion":"Creating a character that embodies the chilling essence of underground horror presents a thrilling artistic opportunity. To craft this character, imagine them not just as a figure in the artwork but as a being with a story that adds depth to the fear and intrigue they inspire. Here's your prompt: --- **Title:** The Gatekeeper of the Forgotten Depths **Backstory:** Once a caretaker of the abandoned subway, this character was transformed by a mysterious event that occurred deep within the tunnels. Bound to the darkness, they became part of the underground world, a guardian of secrets and lost souls. Over the decades, they've evolved into something more than human, a blend of shadow and substance, tasked with keeping the balance between the world above and the mysteries below. **Appearance:** - **Form:** Humanoid but distinctly altered by their environment and the passage of time. Their body appears almost fused with elements of the subway's architecture, featuring hints of metal and rust, as if they're both guardian and part of the labyrinth itself. - **Eyes:** Glowing softly with an eerie light, these are the most striking feature, capable of piercing through the darkest shadows, hinting at the character's supernatural abilities to see and navigate the deep darkness. - **Clothing:** What remains of their clothing is tattered and merges with the textures of the tunnels (rust, grime, and moss). It should look as though the fabric is simultaneously disintegrating and becoming one with the character, suggesting an ageless existence. - **Accessories or Markings:** Enigmatic symbols or tattoos could cover parts of their skin, glowing faintly, each marking representing a story or soul they've encountered. Small, personal items from those who've lost their way in the tunnels might hang from their attire, tokens of the lives they've touched. **Personality and Traits:** - **Mysterious and Solemn:** They are the silent watcher of the underground, wise yet weary from their endless vigil. - **Protector and Punisher:** To those who come with respect, they might offer guidance or a glimpse of hidden truths. But to those who pose a threat to the balance, they show no mercy, using their powers to disorient and terrify. - **Connected to the Tunnels:** They have an intrinsic connection to the underground, able to manipulate shadows and navigate the labyrinth effortlessly. They can also communicate with the lost souls that wander the depths, offering them solace or passage. **Role in the Artwork:** - Positioned at a point that seems both welcoming and warning, at the boundary between light and the enveloping darkness of the tunnels. - Their posture suggests readiness, as if they're about to move, emphasizing their role as the active guardian of the threshold. - The environment interacts with them, shadows seeming to emanate from or converge towards them, highlighting their connection to the underground. **Mood and Palette:** - The atmosphere around the character is thick with anticipation and mystery. Colors should be muted and dark, with the character's eyes and markings providing the only sources of light in deep shades of otherworldly colors. - The use of shadows is key, adding depth and complexity to the character's form and expression, creating a sense of the ethereal or ghostly. **Technique Suggestions:** - Play with textures to emphasize the fusion of the character with their environment, allowing elements of metal, grime, and decay to influence their appearance. - Use lighting strategically to focus on the character's eyes and any symbols, enhancing their mystical and eerie presence. - The character's expression should be enigmatic, inviting curiosity about their intentions and history. --- This character, The Gatekeeper of the Forgotten Depths, stands as a compelling figure in your underground horror scene, embodying the mysteries and terrors of the world below.

It's a universally respected profession, known for its remarkable ability to heal and save lives. However, despite its nobility, I've come to realize it's a career I wouldn't want to pursue. Firstly, the path to becoming a doctor is incredibly long and arduous. The idea of spending at least nine years in academic study, between undergraduate education, medical school, and residency, is daunting. This extensive period of learning, while necessary, feels overwhelming. It demands a level of commitment and stamina that I admire in others but cannot see in myself. Secondly, the job itself is extremely challenging. Beyond the extensive educational requirement, doctors face immense pressure in their day-to-day work. They carry the weight of making critical decisions that can affect their patients' lives and well-being. This responsibility is coupled with the need to constantly stay updated with medical advancements and maintain rigorous work schedules. The emotional and physical toll it can take on a person is significant.

Japan also makes Manchukuo and Mengjiang into protectorates once more as in the WW2 era, with the JSDF providing tactical and logistical support and military training to the restored Manchukuo Imperial Army and Inner Mongolian Army along with [the JSDF] covertly aiding pro-democracy, pro-Western and Japanophilic elements of the CCP, NPC and PLA along with anti-CCP, anti-PRC pro-democracy Chinese to restore the Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC as the government of post-CCP, post-PRC China. Han China is [Han China] stable [Han China] for a while under the restored democratic government [the Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC] after the toppling of the PRC and CCP, but however due to the strengthened influence of the millennialist Chinese folk religious sect focused on militant self-defense and tax resistance along with romanticised monarchism, wishing to restore the pre-Qing Han Chinese Imperial House of Zhu-ruled absolute imperial dynastic royal monarchy of the Great Ming State/Great Ming Empire/\\"Ming dynasty\\" as the government of China, the Yellow Sand Society, which [the Yellow Sand Society] was [the Yellow Sand Society] never suppressed [the Yellow Sand Society] by the CCP, People's Police, MSS and PAP in 1980 unlike in OTL and an unrelated growth in monarchism and nostalgia for the pre-Qing and pre-Mongol Empire Han Chinese imperial dynastic era among the Han Chinese people after the fall of the CCP and PRC, this restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becomes the short-lived, Yuan Shikai formed and Yuan Shikai-ruled unitary constitutional monarchy of the Empire of China, [the restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becoming the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China], albiet with the Chinese imperial family [the Imperial House of Zhu] being [the Imperial House of Zhu] reenthroned [the Imperial House of Zhu] instead of Yuan Shikai's descendants formally taking the Chinese throne, [the restored Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC once again becoming the Yuan Shikai-formed Empire of China, albiet ruled by the Imperial House of Zhu] after the restoration of the monarchy [the Great Ming State and the Imperial House of Zhu] is [the restoration of the monarchy in Han China] put up [the restoration of the monarchy in Han China] to the Han Chinese people via a referendum by the recently restored democratic Chinese government [the Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC] with an overwhelming amount of the Chinese people voting \\"Yes\\" [for the restoration of the monarchy in China]. This ironically fulfills the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution, which [the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution] was [the goal of the first Xinhai Revolution] to [what the first Xinhai Revolution aimed to do] \\"Overthrow Qing and restore Ming\\", in other words restore the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State as the government [the Imperial House of Zhu and the Great Ming State] of Han China after the overthrow of the Great Ming State. The restored Empire of China ruling over post-PRC, post-CCP Han China still has the official name of the \\"People's Republic of China' in English but [the restored Great Ming State] has the Beiyang Government's and the first Republic of China's five-colored flag [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] is [the five-colored flag] a banner [the five-colored flag] having five horizontal bands of red [Han], yellow [Manchu], blue [Mongol], white [Hui] and black [Tibet] with the Ming Sun and Moon symbol, a white circle with a smaller red circle in the left, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol], representing [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] an eclipse, [the Ming Sun and Moon symbol] in the middle [of the modified five colored flag] as its [the restored Great Ming State's] unofficial national flag.

The Beiyang Government of the Republic of China’s Twelve Symbols national emblem is [the twelve Symbols National Emblem] rechosen [the twelve Symbols national emblem] as the Chinese national emblem, albiet with two crossed 18-star iron blood flags behind the main insigna of the emblem as tribute to the Xinhai Revolution, and a plum blossom/Chinese plum seal akin to the Japanese imperial family's, the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato's/the Minamoto dynasty's Chrysanthemum seal is [the plum blossom seal] chosen [the plum blossom seal] as the reinstated Imperial House of Zhu's seal while the peony remains the Chinese national flower. The restored Great Ming State also has the first incarnation of the Empire of China's national anthem, \\"China heroically stands in the Universe\\", as its [the restored Great Ming State's] national anthem. Yuan Shikai's descendants are [Yuan Shikai's descendants] absorbed [Yuan Shikai's descendants] into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu via concubine, polygamy, multiple marriages and adoption as a means of forming a unified post-1644 Chinese imperial house and also to prevent any succession claims.

The descendants of the Han Chinese bannerman of the Qing military system turned military dictator and bandit tyrant of Manchuria after the Xinhai Revolution and during the modern period of Chinese warlord history that followed Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, the \\"Old Marshal\\" Zhang Zhuolin, who [Zhuolin] was [Zhuolin] leader of the Han Chinese bandit warlord faction/military junta of the Fengtian Clique that [the Fengtian Clique] had [the Fengtian Clique] occupied [the Fengtian Clique] both post-Xinhai, post-Qing Manchuria and the Beiyang Government of the First Republic of China and his [Zhuolin's] more famous son, the infamous \\"Young Marshall\\" Zhang Xueliang, who [Xueliang] inherited his [Xueliang's] father's [Xueliang's] positions as both head of state of the Beiyang-ruled ROC and thus de-facto leader of Manchuria and leader of the Fengtian Clique after his [Zhuolin's] death, [the surviving Zhang descendants] are [the surviving Zhang descendants] also integrated [the surviving Zhang descendants] into the reenthroned Imperial House of Zhu via concubinage, multiple marriages and adoption. The restored Empire of China is known as North China, or simply China by the global masses while the restored Nationalist China in Guangxi and Guangdong is known as South China, or Cantonia. The restored Empire of Manchukuo is also called North China by the global masses, to the expiration of the Manchu people. The USSR and USA both maintain their [the USSR's and USA's] joint position of Nationalist China being [Nationalist China] the only true China [Nationalist China] and [the USSR and USA] both [the USSR and USA] send a tremendous amount of military, economic and industrial aid to the restored Nationalist China in Guangxi and Guangdong, [the USSR and USA] refusing [the USSR and USA] to [the USSR and USA] recognize both the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo as sovereign, legitimate nations [the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo] despite the restored Empire of China holding Nationalist China's former seat at the UN and the restored Empire of Manchukuo holding the PRC's former seat at the UN, the restored Empire of China and the restored Empire of Manchukuo having embassies and diplomatic relations with the rest of the world and the restored Empire of China being [the restored Empire of China] recognized [the restored Empire of China] by the Hague, the UN and the rest of the world as the legitimate successor state [the restored Empire of China] of the Great Qing Empire, pre-1949 Nationalist China and the post-Mao-era PRC and the restored Empire of Manchukuo as the legitimate successor state [the restored Empire of Manchukuo] of the Fengtian Clique-occupied Beiyang Government-ruled first ROC and the Mao era PRC.

At the heart of these upheavals was the unexpected dissolution of the People's Republic of China (PRC), an event precipitated by widespread anti-corruption protests, demands for democratic reforms, and the subsequent brutal suppression of dissent in Tiananmen Square. This pivotal moment not only marked the end of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) dominance but also heralded the fragmentation of the PRC into a mosaic of independent states and the resurgence of historical dynasties thought long extinguished. The aftermath of the protests saw erstwhile cohesive provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi, and Yunnan declare independence from the faltering grip of the CCP. These declarations of independence breathed life into suppressed national identities and regional ambitions, catalyzing a chain reaction that would radically redraw the political map of Asia. In Guangdong and Guangxi, the exiled Kuomintang (KMT), finding fertile ground for its resurgence, established the Second Republic of China. This entity, a stratocracy of sorts, melded Sun Yat Sen's principles with contemporary governance models, creating a directorial republic underpinned by a strong military backbone. The migration of the Republic of China Armed Forces to Guangdong and Guangxi cemented the area as a bastion of KMT influence. Simultaneously, the disintegration of the PRC's central authority spurred the reestablishment of historical governments across the newly independent territories. In East Turkestan, the Kumul Khanate was restored, while Tibet reembraced its theocratic Buddhist monarchy. Yunnan resurrected the Daili Kingdom, denying Nationalist China's annexation attempts. Even the vast expanses of Central China witnessed the rise of a new, yet ancient, governance structure with the revival of the Great Tang Empire, a reflection of the enduring legacy of China's imperial past. Manchuria, seeking to distance itself from the chaotic aftermath and assert its distinct identity, reinstated the Empire of Manchukuo, drawing upon its heritage as a former Imperial Japanese protectorate. Through a combination of ethnic solidarity and strategic defections, Manchukuo restored its military and integrated reform-minded elements, positioning itself as a major regional power. Similarly, the Japanese province of Formosa was reconstituted on Taiwan, absorbing the remnants of Nationalist Chinese military and intelligence assets, thereby magnifying Japan's strategic depth and technological prowess in the region. The seismic shifts in East Asia were not isolated phenomena but part of a broader pattern of change that swept across the globe. In Europe, the perceived injustices and historical grievances stemming from World War I and World War II settlements were revisited, leading to the restoration of the German Empire and Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. These restorations, rooted in a complex interplay of nationalism, historical revisionism, and geopolitical maneuvering, reshaped Europe's political landscape, challenging the post-war order established by victorious Allied powers. Central to the reconfiguration of Europe was the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, reenforced upon a weakened Soviet Union by the newly resurgent German and Austro-Hungarian empires. This set the stage for the revival of monarchies across Eastern Europe, including the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Poland, the Kingdom of Serbia, and the Principality of Albania, among others. These resurrected monarchies sought to legitimize their rule through appeals to historical continuity, national identity, and a renewal of traditional alliances. As the 20th century drew to a close, the world witnessed the unlikely restoration of ancient empires and kingdoms, the rekindling of long-suppressed national identities, and a profound realignment of international alliances. This era of restoration, however, was not merely an exercise in nostalgia but a reflection of the deep-seated yearnings for stability, cultural preservation, and governance models perceived as more attuned to the unique histories and values of the peoples they served. Amidst this resurgence of the old order, questions lingered about the durability of these revived systems in the face of modern challenges and the ever-present undercurrents of change shaping the dawn of the 21st century."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
