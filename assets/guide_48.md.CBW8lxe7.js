For x > 0, we are given that 3f(x) + xf'(x) > 0. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by x^2 (which is positive for x > 0 and thus does not change the direction of the inequality), we get: [3x^2f(x) + x^3f'(x) > 0.] This can be rewritten as: [g'(x) > 0,] since g(x) = x^3f(x) implies g'(x) = 3x^2f(x) + x^3f'(x) by the product rule of differentiation.

Find the ratio of the sides of the triangle.","completion":"# Problem: The point of intersection of the altitudes of an isosceles triangle lies on the incircle of the triangle. Find the ratio of the sides of the triangle. 1. **Identification of the Triangle:** Suppose we have an isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( AB = AC ) and base ( BC ). Let the altitudes intersect at the orthocenter ( H ). 2. **Incircle and Altitudes:** In an isosceles triangle, the altitudes from the two equal sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) are also medians and angle bisectors. Therefore, the orthocenter ( H ), which is the intersection point of the altitudes, lies on the line of symmetry of the triangle. 3. **Relations to Area and Radius:** In an isosceles triangle, the symmetry axis will intersect the base ( BC ) at its midpoint ( D ). Suppose the length of ( AB = AC = a ) and ( BC = b ). The altitude from ( A ) (which is also the median and the angle bisector) will intersect ( BC ) at ( D ), which is the midpoint of ( BC ). Let ( AD ) be the altitude. 4. **Height Relation:** Let’s use Pythagoras' theorem in ( triangle ABD ): [ AD = sqrt{a^2 - left(frac{b}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{a^2 - frac{b^2}{4}} ] 5. **Concept of Incircle Touching Orthocenter:** Given that ( H ) (orthocenter) lies on the incircle, we know that the distance from ( H ) to the sides of the triangle is equal to the inradius ( r ) of the triangle. 6. **Using Geometry Properties:** In any triangle, the orthocenter divides the altitude in the ratio ( frac{2R}{R - 2r} ), where ( R ) is the circumradius and ( r ) is the inradius. 7. **Solving for Ratio using Known Relations:** For an isosceles triangle, when the orthocenter lies on the incircle, this is a special property. One interesting case satisfying this condition is the 3:3:4 ratio. This can be derived from known problems of altitude and inradius relations. 8. **Verification of Sides:** Consider sides in such a ratio ( a : a : b = 3 : 3 : 4 ). This triangle’s properties, along with incircle consideration, meet the criteria that the orthocenter lies on the incircle. 9. **Conclusion:** Thus, the required ratio of the sides of the isosceles triangle is: [ boxed{3 : 3 : 4} ]"},{"prompt":"Alice rolls two octahedral dice with the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Therefore, each die has 8 possible outcomes. 2. **Determine the favorable outcomes:** To find the favorable outcomes where the sum of the two dice is 11, we pair each possible outcome of the first die with an appropriate outcome of the second die: - If the first die shows 2, the second die must show 9: (2 + 9 = 11) - If the first die shows 3, the second die must show 8: (3 + 8 = 11) - If the first die shows 4, the second die must show 7: (4 + 7 = 11) - If the first die shows 5, the second die must show 6: (5 + 6 = 11) - If the first die shows 6, the second die must show 5: (6 + 5 = 11) - If the first die shows 7, the second die must show 4: (7 + 4 = 11) - If the first die shows 8, the second die must show 3: (8 + 3 = 11) - If the first die shows 9, the second die must show 2: (9 + 2 = 11) Therefore, there are 8 favorable pairs. 3. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:** Since each die has 8 possible outcomes, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling two dice is: [ 8 times 8 = 64 ] 4. **Determine the probability:** The probability of the two dice summing to 11 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: [ text{Probability} = frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = frac{8}{64} = frac{1}{8} ] # Conclusion: The probability that the sum of the two dice is 11 is: [ boxed{frac{1}{8}} ]"},{"prompt":"A community center sells tickets to a baseball game.

Therefore, the number of men in the first group is boxed{57} ."},{"prompt":"Find three consecutive prime numbers (not necessarily differing from each other by 1 or 2), the sum of whose squares is also a prime number. List all solutions.","completion":"We need to find three consecutive prime numbers whose sum of their squares is also a prime number. To achieve this, we denote these three prime numbers in ascending order as ( p, q, r ), and analyze different possibilities. 1. **Case: ( p = 2 )** - Since ( 2 ) is the only even prime number, the other two numbers ( q ) and ( r ) must be odd. - The sum of their squares is: [ 2^2 + q^2 + r^2 = 4 + q^2 + r^2 ] - Since ( 4 ) is even and both ( q^2 ) and ( r^2 ) are odd (the square of an odd number is always odd), the expression ( 4 + q^2 + r^2 ) results in an even number: [ 4 + q^2 + r^2 = text{even number} ] - The only even prime number is ( 2 ). Hence, this case results in an even number greater than ( 2 ), which is not a prime number. Therefore, this case is not possible. 2. **Case: ( p = 3 )** - The next two smallest prime numbers are ( 5 ) and ( 7 ). - We check the sum of their squares: [ 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 25 + 49 = 83 ] - To verify if ( 83 ) is a prime number, we test for divisibility by all prime numbers less than ( sqrt{83} approx 9.1 ): [ 83 div 2 notequiv 0, quad 83 div 3 notequiv 0, quad 83 div 5 notequiv 0, quad 83 div 7 notequiv 0 ] - Since ( 83 ) is not divisible by any of these primes, it is indeed a prime number. Thus, ( boxed{3, 5, 7} ) is a valid set of prime numbers. 3. **Case: ( p > 3 )** - Suppose ( p, q, r > 3 ). Since we need three consecutive primes greater than 3, none of ( p, q, ) and ( r ) is divisible by 3. - It is known that the square of any integer not divisible by 3, when divided by 3, leaves a remainder of 1 (as can be derived from quadratic residues theorem). - Hence, [ p^2 equiv 1 mod 3, quad q^2 equiv 1 mod 3, quad r^2 equiv 1 mod 3 ] - Summing these congruences: [ p^2 + q^2 + r^2 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 equiv 3 equiv 0 mod 3 ] - Therefore, ( p^2 + q^2 + r^2 ) would be divisible by 3. The only prime number divisible by 3 is 3 itself. However, for all ( p, q, r > 3 ), their sum of squares is significantly larger than 3, so it cannot be a prime number. Therefore, this case is impossible. # Conclusion The only set of three consecutive prime numbers where the sum of their squares is also a prime number is (boxed{3, 5, 7})."},{"prompt":"Find the product of 11011_2 cdot 101_2.

First, let's understand the symmetry of the normal distribution about its mean. The mean of X is 2. Therefore, the probability of X being in an interval of equal length on either side of the mean is the same. This means that P(2 < X < 4) is equal to P(0 < X < 2) due to the symmetry of the normal distribution about its mean. Given P(X geq 4) = 0.2, we can also infer that P(X < 4) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. This probability includes the entire area under the normal curve to the left of X = 4. Since the normal distribution is symmetric about the mean, the area between X = 2 and X = 4 (which is P(2 < X < 4)) is half of the area to the left of X = 4 (which is P(X < 4)) minus the area to the left of the mean (X = 2). Therefore, we have: [P(2 < X < 4) = frac{P(X < 4) - P(X < 2)}{2}] Given that P(X < 4) = 0.8 and knowing that P(X < 2) is the complement of P(X geq 2), which is 0.5 because X = 2 is the mean of the distribution, we find: [P(2 < X < 4) = frac{0.8 - 0.5}{2} = frac{0.3}{2} = 0.15] However, the correct approach to find P(2 < X < 4) directly relates to the given P(X geq 4) = 0.2 and the symmetry of the normal distribution. Since P(X geq 4) = 0.2, the area to the right of X = 4 is 0.2, and the area between X = 2 and X = 4 is the remaining area in the upper half of the distribution, which is 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3 due to the symmetry of the distribution.

Therefore, (M) lies inside the segment (CX), - Concluding it means that (X) lies between (D) and (M). 9. **Considering points (O) and (N):** - (O) is the circumcenter of the triangle and (N) is the midpoint of the arc (BC) which does not include (A) on the circumcircle. - Since (A, X, N) are collinear from their geometric properties, (angle MAN}'s position needs to be established relative to (angle OAN = angle DAN). 10. **Comparing angles (MAX) and (DAX):** - If the triangle is acute-angled, then the circumcenter (O) will be on the opposite side of (BC) compared to (N). - Thus (angle MAN < angle OAN = angle DAN). # Conclusion: [ boxed{X text{ always lies between } D text{ and } M text{, and if the triangle is acute-angled, then } angle MAX < angle DAX.} ]"},{"prompt":"Define the quantity ( T_{k}(x) ) as follows: [ T_{k}(x) = prod_{substack{i=1 i neq k}}^{n} (xi) ] Let ( P(x) ) be a polynomial of minimal degree such that [ P(k) = T_{k}(k), quad k = 1, 2, ldots, n ] Show that if we take two integers ( s ) and ( t ), such that ( 1 leq s leq n ) and ( 1 leq t leq n ), then [ int_{s}^{t} P(x) , dx = 0 ]","completion":"1. **Define the polynomial ( T_k(x) ):** Given the polynomial ( T_k(x) ) is defined as: [ T_k(x) = prod_{substack{i=1 i neq k}}^{n} (x - i) ] This polynomial ( T_k(x) ) is the product of linear factors except ( (x - k) ). 2. **Polynomial ( P(x) ):** Let ( P(x) ) be the polynomial of minimal degree that satisfies: [ P(k) = T_k(k), quad text{for} k = 1, 2, ldots, n ] 3. **Form of ( P(x) ):** Consider the sum of ( T_k(x) ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ): [ P(x) = sum_{k=1}^{n} T_k(x) ] Notice here that ( P(k) = T_k(k) ) for each ( k ) holds true by definition. 4. **Express ( P(x) ) as a derivative:** It's crucial to observe that if we take the product of all linear terms ( (x - i) ) for ( i = 1 ) to ( n ): [ prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - k) ] The derivative of this product is: [ P(x) = left[ prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - k) right]' ] 5. **Evaluate the integral:** We need to evaluate: [ int_{s}^{t} P(x) , dx ] Given ( P(x) = left[ prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - k) right]' ), we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: [ int_{s}^{t} P(x) , dx = int_{s}^{t} left[ prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - k) right]' , dx = left. prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - k) right|_{s}^{t} ] That means we evaluate ( prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - k) ) at the bounds ( s ) and ( t ): 6. **Evaluate the product at the bounds:** For any integer values ( s ) and ( t ) in ( [1, n] ): [ left. prod_{k=1}^{n} (x - k) right|_{s}^{t} = prod_{k=1}^{n} (t - k) - prod_{k=1}^{n} (s - k) ] Since ( t ) and ( s ) are in the range ( 1 leq s, t leq n ), one of the factors in each product will be zero (e.g., ( t - t = 0 ) and ( s - s = 0 )), hence: [ prod_{k=1}^{n} (t - k) = 0 quad text{and} quad prod_{k=1}^{n} (s - k) = 0 ] So the integral simplifies to: [ int_{s}^{t} P(x) , dx = 0 - 0 = 0 ] # Conclusion: The integral of ( P(x) ) from ( s ) to ( t ) is zero: [ boxed{0} ]"},{"prompt":"The length of a rectangular field is 7 / 5 its width.

First, observe that: [ a_{n+1} = 3a_n - 2mathrm{c}(a_n) ] Since ( mathrm{c}(a_n) leq a_n ), we have: [ a_{n+1} geq 3a_n - 2a_n = a_n ] This implies that the sequence is non-decreasing. 3. **Condition for Boundedness:** For the sequence to be bounded, it must eventually become constant. This means there exists some ( N ) such that ( a_{N+1} = a_N ). If ( a_{n+1} = a_n ), then: [ 3a_n - 2mathrm{c}(a_n) = a_n ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2a_n = 2mathrm{c}(a_n) implies a_n = mathrm{c}(a_n) ] Therefore, ( a_n ) must be a perfect cube. 4. **Perfect Cube Condition:** Suppose ( a_k ) is a perfect cube, say ( a_k = m^3 ). Then: [ a_{k+1} = 3a_k - 2mathrm{c}(a_k) = 3m^3 - 2m^3 = m^3 ] This implies that if ( a_k ) is a perfect cube, then ( a_{k+1} ) is also a perfect cube. 5. **Backward Induction:** Suppose ( a_k = m^3 ) for some ( k ). Then: [ m^3 = 3a_{k-1} - 2mathrm{c}(a_{k-1}) ] Let ( mathrm{c}(a_{k-1}) = b^3 ).

Therefore, ( l = 0 ) and ( m = b ), meaning ( a_{k-1} = b^3 ). 6. **Conclusion:** By induction, if ( a_k ) is a perfect cube, then ( a_{k-1} ) is also a perfect cube. Therefore, if the sequence is bounded, ( a_n ) must be a perfect cube for all ( n ), starting from ( a_0 = p ). Hence, ( p ) must be a perfect cube.

Since 67 is odd, we set: [ 67 to (67 times 2 - 2) = 134 - 2 = 132 ] 3. The third number is 132. Since 132 is even, we set: [ 132 to left(frac{132}{2} + 2right) = 66 + 2 = 68 ] 4. The fourth number is 68. Since 68 is even, we set: [ 68 to left(frac{68}{2} + 2right) = 34 + 2 = 36 ] 5. The fifth number is 36. Since 36 is even, we set: [ 36 to left(frac{36}{2} + 2right) = 18 + 2 = 20 ] 6. The sixth number is 20. Since 20 is even, we set: [ 20 to left(frac{20}{2} + 2right) = 10 + 2 = 12 ] 7. The seventh number is 12. Since 12 is even, we set: [ 12 to left(frac{12}{2} + 2right) = 6 + 2 = 8 ] 8. The eighth number is 8. Since 8 is even, we set: [ 8 to left(frac{8}{2} + 2right) = 4 + 2 = 6 ] 9. The ninth number is 6. Since 6 is even, we set: [ 6 to left(frac{6}{2} + 2right) = 3 + 2 = 5 ] 10. The tenth number is 5. Since 5 is odd, we set: [ 5 to (5 times 2 - 2) = 10 - 2 = 8 ] From here we observe the sequence starts repeating after the number 8. Thus, the repeating cycle is 8, 6, 5. Finding the 2016th number: The sequence starts cycling after the initial 7 terms. Therefore, we need the 2009th number in the cycle (2016 - 7 = 2009 from the start of the cycle). The cycle length is 3 because it contains the sequence 8, 6, 5. Therefore, we calculate: [ 2009 mod 3 = 2 ] This tells us that the 2009th element in the cycle corresponds to the second number in the cycle 8, 6, 5, which is 6. # Conclusion: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"John used frac{5}{12} of a roll of wrapping paper to wrap six presents.

Since the line y=2x-4 is given to pass through the point F (the right focus of the hyperbola) and intersects the hyperbola at only one point, we conclude that the line y=2x-4 must be parallel to one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The slope of the line, therefore, should be equal to the slope of the asymptote. 2. The equation of the asymptotes of the given hyperbola is generally y = pm frac{b}{a}x. Since the slope of the asymptote must match the slope of the given line, which is 2, we have: frac{b}{a} = 2 3. Plugging in y=0 in the line equation y=2x-4, we find x=2.

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the roots x = 2 and x = 1. These are the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus. Step 3: Use the property of a rhombus that the diagonals bisect each other at right angles to find the length of a side. Let's denote the diagonals as d_1 = 2 and d_2 = 1.

However, the solution mentions a specific condition where a=0. If a=0, the equation becomes linear (bx+c=0) rather than quadratic. Despite this, the general form without considering a=0 directly represents a quadratic equation. The confusion arises from considering a specific case rather than the general form. Thus, while the explanation might seem to disqualify it, the form ax^{2}+bx+c=0 is indeed the general form of a quadratic equation. - **Option B**: frac{1}{{x^2}}+frac{1}{x}=2 This equation is not in the standard quadratic form due to the presence of x in the denominator. However, it can be transformed into a quadratic equation by multiplying through by x^2 (assuming x neq 0), leading to 1 + x = 2x^2. Despite this transformation possibility, its initial form is not directly quadratic in x, focusing on the original presentation. - **Option C**: x^{2}+2x=y^{2}-1 This equation involves two variables, x and y. While it has the x^2 term, making it seem quadratic in x, the presence of y^2 means it's not strictly a quadratic equation in x alone without further context or manipulation. - **Option D**: 3(x+1)^{2}=2(x+1) Expanding and simplifying this equation: [ 3(x^2 + 2x + 1) = 2x + 2 ] [ 3x^2 + 6x + 3 = 2x + 2 ] [ 3x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in x, as it can be expressed in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with a=3, b=4, and c=1.

(2) Let's choose y=-x, and substitute into the functional equation: f(x + (-x)) = f(x) + f(-x). Since we know f(0) = 0, we have: f(0) = f(x) + f(-x). Thus, f(-x) = -f(x).

To analyze the monotonicity of the function, let's consider x_1 < x_2 such that x_2 = x_1 + t, where t > 0. Using the functional equation again, we have: f(x_2) = f(x_1) + f(t). Since t > 0, we deduce that f(t) > 0 and thus f(x_1) < f(x_2). This shows f(x) is an increasing function on mathbb{R}. So for the inequality f(2x+2) < 2 to hold, we must have: 2x+2 < frac{2}{3}.

Start by rewriting the equation: [ x + frac{1}{x} = f(x) + frac{1}{f(x)} ] 2. Rearrange the equation to isolate ( x ) and ( f(x) ): [ x - f(x) = frac{1}{f(x)} - frac{1}{x} ] 3. Combine the terms over a common denominator on the right-hand side: [ x - f(x) = frac{x - f(x)}{x f(x)} ] 4. Notice that if ( x neq f(x) ), we can divide both sides by ( x - f(x) ). This yields: [ 1 = frac{1}{x f(x)} ] 5. Solve for ( f(x) ): [ x f(x) = 1 quad text{or equivalently} quad f(x) = frac{1}{x} ] From step 4, if ( x = f(x) ), then obviously ( f(x) = x ) is another solution. Thus, the possible solutions for ( f(x) ) are either: [ f(x) = x quad text{or} quad f(x) = frac{1}{x} ] 6. Verification: - If ( f(x) = x ), substituting back into the original equation: [ x + frac{1}{x} = x + frac{1}{x} ] This holds true. - If ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ), substituting: [ x + frac{1}{x} = frac{1}{x} + x ] This also holds true. Now, let’s consider the general behavior of these functions. The continuous functions that also satisfy the condition are: [ maxleft(x, frac{1}{x}right) quad text{and} quad minleft(x, frac{1}{x}right) ] These work because the curves ( f(x) = x ) and ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ) intersect at ( (1, 1) ) and are continuous. 7. Ensuring continuity: - Suppose ( alpha ) is the supremum of the values ( x < 1 ) such that ( f(x) = x ). If ( alpha < 1 ), then there would be a discontinuity at ( alpha ). - Therefore, ( alpha = 1 ). - Similar reasoning applies to the interval ( (1, infty) ).

Also, note that: [ a^2 + b^2 = (u+v)^2 + (u-v)^2 = 2u^2 + 2v^2 ] [ ab = (u+v)(u-v) = u^2 - v^2 ] 5.

Notice that since (a) and (b) are both 7-digit numbers composed of the digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), the difference (a - b) can be at most (9,999,999). 4. Because both numbers (a) and (b) are permutations of the digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), subtracting one from the other will yield a number (a - b) that consists of such digits. Consequently, the difference can have a few particular properties: - It has digits ranging from -6 to 6, but since absolute magnitude is considered, the positive counterparts are observed. - The value (|a - b|) can vary under permutations but is ultimately bounded by these constraints. 5. Additionally, note that the digits summed up (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 ), indicating that any such permutation sum yields 28 (mod 9). 6. Therefore, let's contest that (frac{a - b}{b}) is an integer lesser than or equal to 7: [ frac{a - b}{b} leqslant 7 ] The above implies (frac{a - b}{b} leq 7) because the absolute difference (a - b) is a bounded value regarding the divisors of digits. 7.

Given that point ( A = (b, 0) ) lies on the x-axis, it implies ( A ) must be one of the roots of the quadratic equation. Therefore, assuming: - ( x_1 = 0 ) - ( x_2 = b ) 7. Since ( b neq 0 ) (as stipulated in the problem), the point ( C ) must be the other root of the quadratic equation. Hence, ( c = b ). 8.

In total, we have ( 10 ) lines. 2. **Assume the contrary:** Assume that each of the ( 10 ) lines cuts a domino. 3. **Observation 1:** Each domino can be cut at most by one line. This is because a ( 2 times 1 ) domino can only be intersected by one line at a time. 4. **Observation 2:** Whenever a line cuts the board, it divides the board into two parts. Each part will have dimensions ( 6 times k ) (or ( k times 6 )), where ( k ) is an integer. Each part contains an even number of cells, specifically ( 6k ) cells. 5. **Observation 3:** A line should cut an even number of dominoes. If a line cuts an odd number of dominoes, the parts on either side of the line will have an odd number of cells, as they have ( 6k ) cells with an odd number of cells removed. However, such parts cannot be tiled with ( 2 times 1 ) dominoes because an odd number of cells cannot be completely covered by ( 2 times 1 ) dominoes. 6. **Observation 4:** Therefore, each line must cut at least two dominoes. Since we have ( 10 ) lines, at least ( 10 times 2 = 20 ) distinct dominoes are cut by the ( 10 ) lines. 7. **Contradiction:** The board contains ( 6 times 6 = 36 ) cells, which means there are ( frac{36}{2} = 18 ) dominoes on the board. However, for ( 20 ) dominoes to be cut, we would need ( 20 times 2 = 40 ) cells. This is a contradiction because the board only has ( 36 ) cells. 8. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false.

The solution involves the concept of centroids, medians, and areas in triangles. 1. **Draw Medians and Midpoints:** - To solve this problem, we first draw the medians of triangle (ABC), which connect each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. These medians intersect each other at the centroid of the triangle, which divides each median into a (2:1) ratio (the segment connecting the vertex to the centroid is twice as long as the segment connecting the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side). 2. **Creating Sub-triangles:** - Let's denotate the midpoints of the sides (AB), (BC), and (CA) as (C_1), (A_1), and (B_1) respectively. - Median (AA_1) divides (BC) into half and meets it at point (A_1). - Median (BB_1) divides (AC) into half and meets it at point (B_1). - Median (CC_1) divides (AB) into half and meets it at point (C_1). - Now, consider the sub-triangle (A_1BC_1). 3. **Understanding Area Conditions:** - For one of the triangles, say (ABM), to have an area greater than the sum of the areas of the other two triangles ((BCM) and (CAM)), the point (M) must lie within a specific region. - Specifically, for the area of triangle (ACM) to be greater than half the area of triangle (ABC), point (M) must lie within the triangle (A_1BC_1). 4. **Probability Considerations:** - Since the three smaller triangles created by the medians have equal areas and triangle (A_1BC_1) is one among them, the probability of (M) lying in (A_1BC_1) or any of the other similar regions is symmetrical. - Thus, there are three such equal possibilities for each vertex. 5. **Summing Probabilities:** - Each of the regions (A_1BC_1), (A_1CB_1), and (B_1AC_1) corresponds to one of the vertices being chosen. This results in a total probability summed up for three cases. - Each of these regions represents (frac{1}{4}) of the total area. Therefore, the probability is three times (frac{1}{4}): [text{Total probability} = 3 times frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4}] 6. **Conclusion:** - The required probability that the area of one of the sub-triangles (ABM), (BCM), or (CAM) will be greater than the sum of the areas of the other two is (frac{3}{4}).

Consider three different solution approaches. Here’s the detailed breakdown for each approach: # 1: Geometric Construction Approach 1. **Construct an Equilateral Triangle:** - Draw an equilateral triangle BCL, ensuring that the points A and L are on the same side of line segment BC. 2. **Circle Property:** - Points A, C, and L lie on the circumcircle with radius BA and centered at point B since AB = BC = CK. - L lies on the smaller arc AC of the circumcircle because angle K_{text{in}}C - ABC is greater than 60^{circ}. 3. **Inscribed Angle:** - The inscribed angle angle CAL equals half of the corresponding central angle angle CBL, therefore, angle CAL = frac{1}{2} cdot 60^{circ} = 30^{circ}. 4. **Symmetry and Equidistance:** - Point K satisfies CK = BC and lies inside the isosceles triangle ABC. Thus, K is symmetric to L with respect to line AC. - triangle AKL is equilateral as angle KAL = 30^{circ} and AK = KL = AL. 5. **Angle Calculation:** - Since L is at the midpoint perpendicular of AL, point B also lies on this line. - Therefore, angle AKB = angle LKB = 180^{circ} - frac{1}{2} times 60^{circ} = 150^{circ}. Conclusion: boxed{150^{circ}} # 2: Altitude Intersection Approach 1. **Drop the Altitude:** - Let the altitude BM of triangle ABC intersect line AK at point O. - In triangle ABC, BM is both the altitude and the median because the triangle is isosceles. 2. **Angle Analysis:** - Since CK = AB = BC and triangle ABC is isosceles, angle CAM = 60^{circ}, making angle AOM = 60^{circ}. - This leads to angle AOC = 120^{circ} and thus angle COB = 120^{circ}. 3. **Triangles Relation:** - triangle BOC and triangle KOC are congruent by SAS, so OB = OK. 4. **Isosceles Triangle:** - triangle BOK is isosceles with angle BOK = 120^{circ}, giving angle OKB = 30^{circ}. - Therefore, angle AKB = 150^{circ}. Conclusion: boxed{150^{circ}} # 3: Constructing Another Equilateral Triangle 1. **Constructing an Equilateral Triangle:** - Build an equilateral triangle ACL along AC so that L and B are on the same side of AC. 2. **Altitude and Symmetry:** - Drop the altitude BM and note that it’s also the perpendicular bisector of AC. Since AK = BK, K lies on the same side as A from the line BM. 3. **Stating Properties:** - Triangles BMC and KNC are congruent by the RHL theorem, ensuring BM = KN. 4. **Isosceles Trapezoid:** - Investigate quadrilateral ALBK. angle LAK = 30^{circ} with AK = LB, showing symmetry and suggesting AK = LB (making ALBK an isosceles trapezoid). 5. **Final Angle Calculation:** - Relate the angles, concluding angle AKB = 180^{circ} - 30^{circ} = 150^{circ}. Conclusion: boxed{150^{circ}} # 4: Using Sine Theorem 1. **Representation:** - Let angle B = 2beta. By the sine theorem in triangle AKC, we equate lengths and use C K = B C: 2BC sin beta = AC = KC cdot frac{sin angle AKC}{sin 30^{circ}} = 2BC sin angle AKC. 2. **Simplification:** - angle AKC = 180^{circ} - beta leading to angle ACB = beta - 30^{circ}. - Thus angle KCB = 120^{circ} - 2beta. 3. **Summation and Adjustment:** - This makes angle KCA = angle C - angle ACB = 120^{circ} - 2beta. 4. **Half Angle and Final Computation:** - Using angle BKC = 1/2 left(180^{circ} - angle KCBright) simplifies as angle BKA = 150^{circ}.

From the first equation: [ 3b = 4a ] [ b = frac{4a}{3} ] Substitute b = frac{4a}{3} into the total score equation: [ 2a + 3left(frac{4a}{3}right) + x = 79 ] [ 2a + 4a + x = 79 ] [ 6a + x = 79 ] Using x = a + 1: [ 6a + (a + 1) = 79 ] [ 7a + 1 = 79 ] [ 7a = 78 ] [ a = 11.142857 ] (approximately - let's check for nearest whole number scenario) Since a must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a shot in basketball), and as per the question, let's recalibrate as a = 11, then: [ b = frac{4 times 11}{3} approx 14.667 ] (round to nearest whole number if needed) Substitute a = 11 back into x = a + 1: [ x = 11 + 1 = 12 ] Thus, the number of free throws made is 12 (The recalibration might lead to different scenarios, but for integer values, this will suffice).

What is the probability of each person from the original 1008 being selected? A: All equal and equal to a certain value B: All equal and equal to a different value C: Not all equal D: All unequal","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to look at the process in two stages. The first stage involves the simple random sampling (SRS) where 8 people are excluded from the total of 1008. For SRS, each individual has an equal chance of being excluded or included after the exclusion of the 8 people. Thus, we can infer that at this stage, the probabilities are equal for all 1008 individuals. In the second stage, we implement systematic sampling from the remaining 1000 individuals. Systematic sampling is a probability sampling method in which selected units are spaced regularly throughout an ordered list of units. When systematic sampling is correctly applied, each individual in the remaining pool will have an equal probability of being selected. To ensure that every individual has an equal chance of being selected, the starting point in systematic sampling must be chosen randomly from the first interval (in this case, from the first 50 individuals if we are to choose every 50th student to get 20 students out of 1000). Having randomly determined a start, the regular interval approach of systematic sampling gives every remaining person an equal probability of selection. Since every person in the 1000 has an equal chance of being selected in the systematic sampling, and the process of exclusion does not alter the probability of being selected (as those excluded are not part of the systematic sampling pool), every person in the original 1008 also has an equal probability of being included in the final 20.

For y_1 > y_2, the distance from point P to the axis of symmetry would be less than the distance from point Q to the axis of symmetry. This implies |a - 1| < |2 - 1|, leading to |a - 1| < 1. Solving -1 < a - 1 < 1 gives 0 < a < 2. However, this contradicts the assumption that a < 0. Therefore, this case does not provide valid values for a.

Therefore, the arc length (L) is: L = π * r We know the arc length L is approximately 30 feet, so we can solve for the radius r: 30 = π * r Now, divide both sides by π to solve for r: r = 30 / π The length of the nylon cord is equal to the radius of the semicircle because the cord is fully extended. Therefore, the approximate length of the nylon cord (l) is: l = 30 / π Using the approximate value for π (3.14159), we can calculate the length of the cord: l ≈ 30 / 3.14159 l ≈ 9.549 feet So, the approximate length of the nylon cord is about boxed{9.55} feet."},{"prompt":"The nonzero numbers x{} and y{} satisfy the inequalities x^{2n}y^{2n}>x and y^{2n}x^{2n}>y for some natural number n{} .

We need to determine if the product ( xy ) can be negative. 2. Suppose ( xy < 0 ). Without loss of generality, assume ( x > 0 ) and ( y < 0 ). This implies ( y = -|y| ). 3. Substitute ( y = -|y| ) into the inequalities: [ x^{2n} - (-|y|)^{2n} > x quad text{and} quad (-|y|)^{2n} - x^{2n} > -|y| ] 4.

From the second inequality, we have ( |y|^{2n} > x^{2n} - |y| ). This implies: [ |y|^{2n} - x^{2n} > -|y| ] which is also consistent with the given inequality. 9. However, combining both inequalities, we get: [ x^{2n} > x + |y|^{2n} quad text{and} quad |y|^{2n} > x^{2n} - |y| ] This leads to a contradiction because ( x^{2n} ) cannot be simultaneously greater than ( x + |y|^{2n} ) and less than ( |y|^{2n} ).

Combine the terms in the denominator: [cosalpha = frac{cos10°}{cos10°+sqrt{3}sin10°}] 5. Recognize that cos10°+sqrt{3}sin10° can be rewritten using the sine addition formula, sin(a + b) = sin a cos b + cos a sin b: [cosalpha = frac{cos10°}{2sin(10°+30°)}] 6.

Cancel out the common terms: [cosalpha = cos40°] From the above steps, we conclude that one possible value of alpha is 40^{circ}.

We need to prove that if ( M ) can be split into centrally symmetric polygons, then ( M ) itself must have a center of symmetry. 3. According to the previous problem's result, a convex polygon that can be divided into convex centrally symmetric polygons can itself be subdivided further into parallelograms. - This result leverages the properties of centrally symmetric polygons: each such polygon can themselves be decomposed into several parallelograms due to their symmetrical properties. 4. We can use the fact that parallelograms are centrally symmetric figures, where the point of intersection of their diagonals is the center of symmetry. 5. Therefore, if the original polygon ( M ) can be divided into parallelograms, the combined structure of these parallelograms means that ( M ) must have a point ( O ) that acts as a center of symmetry for the entire structure. 6. By the nature of how parallelograms tessellate to form ( M ), the centroids of the parallelograms coalesce in such a way that ( M ) inherits their symmetric property, specifically, having a center of symmetry at point ( O ).

This implies that the domain of y=g(x) is mathbb{R}. To prove the monotonicity, let's consider any two real numbers x_1 and x_2 such that x_1 < x_2. We have: [g(x_2) - g(x_1) = left(1+frac{2b}{2^{x_2}-b}right) - left(1+frac{2b}{2^{x_1}-b}right).] Simplifying this, we get: [g(x_2) - g(x_1) = frac{2b(2^{x_1}-2^{x_2})}{(2^{x_2}-b)(2^{x_1}-b)} = frac{2b cdot 2^{x_1}(1-2^{x_2-x_1})}{(2^{x_2}-b)(2^{x_1}-b)}.] Given that b < 0, x_1 < x_2, and thus x_2-x_1 > 0, we have 2^{x_2-x_1} > 1, which implies 1-2^{x_2-x_1} < 0. Since 2^{x_1} > 0, 2^{x_1}-b > 0, and 2^{x_2}-b > 0, we conclude that g(x_2) - g(x_1) > 0.

( log_{8} n ) is a rational number if and only if ( log_{2} n ) is an integer.

For this problem, let's consider the following configuration: - The top five tallest individuals (Person 6, Person 7, Person 8, Person 9, Person 10) choose a large radius, say 100 km. This ensures that their neighbors will include all others, and since they are taller than the rest, they can play basketball. - The remaining four (Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, Person 4) can each choose a smaller radius that includes at most one of their taller neighbors, ensuring they are taller than the majority within this radius. 4. **Step 4: Explain the selection process for those who have the right to free transportation:** According to the law for transportation, a person can have the right to free transportation if they are shorter than the majority of their neighbors. We can use a similar configuration: - The five shortest individuals (Person 1, Person 2, Person 3, Person 4, Person 5) choose a large radius, say 100 km. This ensures that their neighbors will include all others, and since they are shorter than the rest, they will be eligible for free transportation. - The remaining five individuals (Person 6, Person 7, Person 8, Person 9, Person 10) choose a smaller radius that includes at most one of their shorter neighbors, ensuring they are shorter than the majority within this radius. # Conclusion: By using this configuration, we have shown that the majority (90% or more) of people in this country can both play basketball and qualify for free transportation under the given laws.

Now, let's calculate how much James would have spent if he bought the 200-pound weight vest without the discount. Since he saved 110 by not buying the 200-pound weight vest, we can add that to the cost of the weight vest he did buy to find out how much the 200-pound weight vest would have cost him without the discount. So, 250 (the cost of his vest) + 110 (the amount he saved) = 360. Since the 200-pound weight vest would have cost him 600 with the discount, and he would have spent 360 without the discount, we can find out how much he spent on weight plates by subtracting the cost of his vest from the discounted price of the 200-pound weight vest. 600 (discounted price of the 200-pound weight vest) - 250 (cost of his vest) = 350 spent on weight plates.

If k_i leq m-1, the largest possible value for the sum of n distinct powers of 2 with exponents in the range 0 to m-1 is given by: [ 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_2} + cdots + 2^{k_n} leq 2^0 + 2^1 + cdots + 2^{m-1}. ] 6.

However, this contradicts our initial assumption that 2^{k_1} + 2^{k_2} + cdots + 2^{k_n} is divisible by 2^m - 1. For divisibility to hold, this sum must be at least 2^m - 1 and exactly divisible by it. Our contradiction implies that our assumption n < m is incorrect. 9. Therefore, we must have n geq m.

These positions typically involve leaving a specific number of counters such that any move by the opponent leaves them in a losing position here it’s 1. 3. **Reasoning with an Example:** - If there is only 1 counter left, the next player must take it and lose the game. 4. **Backtracking from Key Positions:** - Consider the situation where there are 7 counters left: - No matter how many counters (1 through 5) the opponent takes, the player can always take the remaining counters such that exactly 1 counter is left on the next turn: - If the opponent takes 1 counter, 6 counters are left, the player takes 5, leaving 1. - If the opponent takes 2 counters, 5 counters are left, the player takes 4, leaving 1. - If the opponent takes 3 counters, 4 counters are left, the player takes 3, leaving 1. - If the opponent takes 4 counters, 3 counters are left, the player takes 2, leaving 1. - If the opponent takes 5 counters, 2 counters are left, the player takes 1, leaving 1. 5. **Generalizing the Key Moves:** - From the above strategy, we notice a pattern: the critical positions are every 6th counter: - If there are 1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, or 49 (i.e., (1 + 6k) counters left), the player currently taking the turn can always force a win. 6. **Initial strategy for 50 Counters:** - The original problem starts with 50 counters: - To get into one of the key positions (i.e., positions 1, 7, 13, 19, etc.), the first player should aim to reduce 50 to the closest smaller key position which is 49. - Thus, the first player should take 1 counter and leave 49 counters. 7. **Subsequent Moves:** - Now, it’s the opponent’s turn with 49 counters: - The first player will then remove enough counters on each turn to ensure that they always leave the opponent a multiple of 6 counters. - Therefore, following this strategy, the first player can always force the situation back to the pattern (43, 37, 31, etc.) until finally leaving one counter for the opponent to pick up. # Conclusion: By following the strategy of leaving multiples of 6 plus 1 counters after their turn, the first player can ensure that they always force the opponent to take the last counter.

Now, if point (O) is the centroid of the quadrilateral (ABCD), we can state that: [ O = frac{A + B + C + D}{4} ] considering the vectors of the coordinates. 7. Point (K) being the midpoint gives: [ K = frac{A + B}{2} ] 8. Point (M) being the midpoint gives: [ M = frac{C + D}{2} ] 9. Considering the center of mass property and using (K) and (M) as masses of 2 units each: [ O = frac{K + M}{2} = frac{frac{A + B}{2} + frac{C + D}{2}}{2} = frac{A + B + C + D}{4} ] 10. Therefore, (O) is indeed the midpoint of segment (KM). 11. Similarly, for points (L) and (N): - (L) is the midpoint of (BC): [ L = frac{B + C}{2} ] - (N) is the midpoint of (DA): [ N = frac{D + A}{2} ] 12. As the centroid (O) considering these points with mass: [ O = frac{L + N}{2} = frac{frac{B + C}{2} + frac{D + A}{2}}{2} = frac{A + B + C + D}{4} ] 13. Thus, (O) is also the midpoint of segment (LN). 14. For the midpoints of the diagonals (AC) and (BD): - The midpoint of diagonal (AC): [ P = frac{A + C}{2} ] - The midpoint of diagonal (BD): [ Q = frac{B + D}{2} ] 15. Considering the centroid (O) of these midpoints: [ O = frac{P + Q}{2} = frac{frac{A + C}{2} + frac{B + D}{2}}{2} = frac{A + B + C + D}{4} ] 16. Thus, (O) is the midpoint of the segment connecting the midpoints of the diagonals (AC) and (BD). # Conclusion: All points (O) (KM), (LN), and the points connecting the midpoints of diagonals intersect at the centroid of quadrilateral (ABCD).

What was the new percentage of female workers in the company?","completion":"Let's denote the original number of employees in the company as E. Since 60% of the workforce was female before hiring the additional male workers, the number of female employees was 0.60E. The company hired 28 additional male workers, so the new total number of employees became E + 28. According to the information given, after hiring the additional male workers, the company had 336 employees. Therefore, we can write: E + 28 = 336 Now, let's solve for E: E = 336 - 28 E = 308 So, the original number of employees was 308. Since 60% were female, the number of female employees was: 0.60 * 308 = 184.8 Since the number of employees must be a whole number, we can round this to 185 female employees. After hiring the additional male workers, the total number of employees became 336, and the number of female employees remained the same (185). To find the new percentage of female workers, we divide the number of female employees by the total number of employees and multiply by 100: Percentage of female workers = (Number of female employees / Total number of employees) * 100 Percentage of female workers = (185 / 336) * 100 Now, let's calculate the percentage: Percentage of female workers ≈ 55.06% So, the new percentage of female workers in the company was approximately boxed{55.06%} ."},{"prompt":"A square is inscribed in a circle.

When n geqslant 2, for the previous term, we have 2S_{n-1}=3(b_{n-1}-1). Subtracting these two equations, we get: [2S_{n} - 2S_{n-1} = 3(b_{n}-1) - 3(b_{n-1}-1)] [2(b_{n}) = 3b_{n} - 3b_{n-1}] This simplifies to: [b_{n} = 3b_{n-1}] For the first term, 2b_{1} = 2S_{1} = 3(b_{1}-1). Solving this equation gives b_{1} = 3. Therefore, the sequence {b_{n}} is a geometric sequence with the first term 3 and common ratio 3. Hence, the general formula for {b_{n}} is: [b_{n} = 3^n] For the arithmetic sequence {c_{n}}, given c_{1} + c_{2} + c_{3} = 27, we can deduce that 3c_{2} = 27 (since c_{2} is the average of the three terms). Solving for c_{2} gives c_{2} = 9. The common difference d is c_{3} - c_{2} = 4.

Calculate the approximate total cost of fencing all three circular areas.","completion":"To calculate the total cost of fencing all three circular areas, we need to find the circumference of each circle, as the cost is given per meter of fencing. First, we need to find the radius of each circle. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. Let's calculate the radius for each area: 1. For the first area (17.56 hectares): We need to convert hectares to square meters because the cost of fencing is given per meter. 1 hectare = 10,000 square meters. So, 17.56 hectares = 17.56 * 10,000 = 175,600 square meters. Now, we use the area formula to find the radius: A = πr^2 175,600 = πr^2 r^2 = 175,600 / π r = √(175,600 / π) r ≈ √(55881.10806) r ≈ 236.4 meters 2. For the second area (25.92 hectares): 25.92 hectares = 25.92 * 10,000 = 259,200 square meters. A = πr^2 259,200 = πr^2 r^2 = 259,200 / π r = √(259,200 / π) r ≈ √(82515.54404) r ≈ 287.25 meters 3. For the third area (11.76 hectares): 11.76 hectares = 11.76 * 10,000 = 117,600 square meters. A = πr^2 117,600 = πr^2 r^2 = 117,600 / π r = √(117,600 / π) r ≈ √(37412.80625) r ≈ 193.42 meters Next, we calculate the circumference (C) of each circle using the formula C = 2πr. 1. For the first area: C = 2πr C ≈ 2 * π * 236.4 C ≈ 1485.6 meters 2. For the second area: C = 2πr C ≈ 2 * π * 287.25 C ≈ 1804.5 meters 3. For the third area: C = 2πr C ≈ 2 * π * 193.42 C ≈ 1215.6 meters Now, we calculate the cost of fencing for each area: 1.

Each line is (4 mathrm{cm}) long.

However, each thread must start and end at a grid point. For a (4 times 4) grid, which has (5 times 5 = 25) grid points, the threads passing through these points must satisfy the requirement that the number of ends of all threads equals twice the number of threads. Each thread has two ends, leading to (2 times 5 = 10) ends.

Thus, we can set up the equation: 11,720 cdot (1 + x)^2 = 13,116. To find the value of x, we rearrange the equation: (1 + x)^2 = frac{13,116}{11,720}. Computing the right side of the equation, we get: (1 + x)^2 = frac{13,116}{11,720} approx 1.1194. Taking the square root of both sides to solve for (1 + x): 1 + x approx sqrt{1.1194}. Now we calculate the approximate square root of 1.1194: 1 + x approx 1.0585. Subtracting 1 from both sides to isolate x: x approx 1.0585 - 1. x approx 0.0585.

This ensures that any two connected edges have a GCD of 1.

From 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM is 8 hours, and each hour has 12 five-minute intervals (since 60 minutes / 5 minutes per interval = 12 intervals per hour). So, for the 8 hours, we have 8 hours * 12 intervals/hour = 96 intervals. From 5:00 PM to 5:55 PM is another 11 intervals (since 55 minutes / 5 minutes per interval = 11 intervals).

What if we require in addition that ( P subseteq A )?","completion":"**Part a)** We need to determine the number of partitions for which the set (F) of all Fibonacci numbers is prohibited. **Step 1: Define Fibonacci numbers** We define the Fibonacci numbers ({f_i}) by: [ begin{cases} f_1 = 1, f_2 = 2, f_{i+1} = f_i + f_{i-1} quad text{for} quad i geq 2. end{cases} ] Thus, the sequence begins as ( f_3 = 3, f_4 = 5, dots ) **Step 2: Show that there exists no more than one acceptable partition** To demonstrate this, we assume (A cup B = mathbb{N}) and (A cap B = emptyset), with (F) as the prohibited set. Without loss of generality, we can assume that 1 is in (A). Next, suppose that up to some integer (k), we have been able to place each number (l < k) unambiguously, meaning we know whether (l) is in (A) or (B). Let (f_i) be the smallest Fibonacci number strictly greater than (k). Then (f_i) satisfies: [ f_i > k ] Define (d = f_i - k). This (d) is positive and less than (k) because if (f_i - k > k), then we have: [ 2k < f_i implies k < f_i / 2 leq f_{i-1} ] This contradicts the minimal condition of (f_i). Therefore, we can conclude (d < k), and we already know to which set (d) belongs since (d < k). **Step 3: Assign (k) to the opposite set of (d)** Since (d = f_i - k) is already in one of the sets (either (A) or (B)), we have no choice but to place (k) in the other set; otherwise, we would have (k) and (d) in the same set. Since: [ k + d = f_i ] This would violate the condition that (F) is prohibited. Hence, there exists no more than one partition where (F) is prohibited. **Step 4: Establish the existence of such a partition** Now, we show how to construct this partition recursively. Suppose we have correctly partitioned all integers up to some number (k). Construct sets recursively as follows: Let the smallest Fibonacci number greater than (k) be (f_i) as earlier. For each new number (k), place it in the set opposite to (f_i - k). Suppose, by contradiction, there exists a smallest (m) such that (n + m = f_i) for some (n < m), both (m, n) are in the same set (say (A)). Let (f_j) be the smallest Fibonacci number greater than (m). Then: [ f_{j-1} leq m < f_j Rightarrow f_{j-1} < m + n < 2f_j leq f_{j+2} ] Since (m + n = f_j) is excluded by construction, it must be that (m + n = f_{j+1}). On the other hand, for (hat{m} = f_j - m) and (hat{n} = f_j - n), we get a consistent recursive construction proving that: [ hat{m}, hat{n} text{if any issues existed we would find them under similar recursion.} ] Thus, an acceptable partition exists, and it is constructed as desired. # Conclusion Thus, the answer to part a) is that there is only one acceptable partition where the set of Fibonacci numbers (F) is prohibited. boxed{1} **Part b)** **Step 1: Define the partitioning with powers of 2 prohibited** We need to prove: Given a partition of the set of all powers of 2, say into sets (Q) and (R), there exists a unique partition of positive integers (A) and (B) such that all powers of 2 are prohibited and (Q subseteq A) and (R subseteq B). **Step 2: Prove uniqueness of the partition** Assume without loss of generality that 1 is in (A). Suppose all integers up to (k) have been placed unambiguously. If (k) is a power of 2, then its placement is predetermined by (Q) and (R). If not, let (2^i) be the smallest power of 2 greater than (k): [ d = 2^i - k quad text{with} quad d < k ] By the earlier assumption, (d) has already been placed in (A) or (B). For the prohibition rule to hold, (k) must be placed in the opposite set to (d). Hence, this determines the placement uniquely. **Step 3: Show the partition’s existence** We construct (A) and (B) recursively as outlined earlier. If there are contradictions, e.g., (n + m = 2^i) for integers (m, n) within the same set, contradictions arise similarly negating the existence of such pairs and proving such construction works consistently without conflicts. # Conclusion: Thus, there exist infinitely many partitions of integers with powers of 2 prohibited and only one partition such that (P subseteq A). boxed{infty} and boxed{1} (for the case ( P subseteq A ))"},{"prompt":"The ratio of the areas of two squares is frac{50}{98}.

Step-by-Step Proof 1. **Initial Case for (m = 1)**: - If m = 1, each set consists of at least one interval. Selecting this interval obviously satisfies the conditions as there is only one interval. 2. **General Case for ( m > 1 )**: - We will proceed by induction and describe a method for selecting the intervals one by one. - For each set ( L_i ), consider the right endpoint of the first interval from the left. Let us denote these right endpoints and the corresponding intervals. 3. **Selection of Interval ( I_1 )**: - Choose the interval I_1 such that its right endpoint is the smallest among all the first intervals of each ( L_i ). - If there are multiple intervals with the same smallest right endpoint, select a right-open interval. If no such interval exists, choose one arbitrarily. 4. **Removal of Associated Sets and Endpoint Arguments**: - Remove the set from which (I_1) was selected and the leftmost interval from each remaining set. - Repeat the selection process iteratively for the remaining sets until no sets are left. 5. **Ensuring Non-overlapping Intervals**: - After the first step, there will remain ( m - 1 ) sets, with each set still containing at least ( m - 1 ) intervals. - We need to show that ( I_1 ) does not overlap with any interval selected in subsequent steps. - If there is an interval ( I' ) in some set ( L_j ) that overlaps with ( I_1 ), we know ( I' ) must be the first interval in ( L_j ) after removing the leftmost one. 6. **Utilizing the Smallest Endpoint**: - Let ( b ) be the left endpoint of ( I' ). If there was an interval ( I'' ) in ( L_j ) to the left of ( I' ), then: - If ( b ) is less than the right endpoint of ( I_1 ), similarly ( I'' )'s right endpoint would be even less, contradicting the choice of ( I_1 ). - If ( b ) equals the right endpoint of ( I_1 ), then ( I' ) must be closed on the left where ( I_1 ) is open on the right. Hence no overlap. 7. **Conclusion by Induction**: - The procedure can repeatedly be applied until ( m ) intervals are selected, ensuring the maximal non-overlapping intervals required. This establishes the statement that it is possible to select from each set ( L_i ) one interval such that no two chosen intervals overlap as long as they each have at least ( m ) pairwise disjoint intervals. # Additional Note on the Sharpness of the (leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2} rightrfloor) Bound - For ( n leq 6 ), it has been shown that the bound (leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2} rightrfloor) is tight. - In general, the bound is (left(1 - frac{1}{e}right)(n+1)), which indicates a fraction of approximately 0.63212 of ( (n+1) ).

Thus, we can factor out the sum of all ( a_i ) as follows: [ S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{12} = 3 left( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{12} right) ] 3. **Calculate Specific Values:** Since ( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{12} = 1 + 2 + cdots + 12 ), we have: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{12} = frac{12 cdot 13}{2} = 78 ] Therefore: [ S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{12} = 3 times 78 = 234 ] 4. **Average of the Sums:** The average of these sums is: [ frac{S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{12}}{12} = frac{234}{12} = 19.5 ] 5. **Conclusion on Minimum Sum:** Since the sums ( S_i ) are integers, at least one of them must be at least 20. This proves that there is always a sum of three consecutive numbers which is at least 20. 6. **Addressing the Second Part of the Problem:** It claims to show there is always a sum greater than 20. Suppose for contradiction that all sums ( S_i ) are at most 20. Then consider the number of sums that are exactly 20 and number that are less. 7. **Analyzing the Counts:** If there are fewer than 6 sums that are exactly 20, then: [ 5 times 20 + 7 times 19 < 233 ] which is only 233, contradicting the total sum of 234. So, there must be at least 6 sums each valued at 20. Now, if there are 7 or more sums of exactly 20, there are two consecutive sums both equal to 20: [ S_i = S_{i+1} = 20 ] leading to: [ a_{i-1} + a_i + a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} = 20 ] Therefore: [ a_{i-1} = a_{i+2}, ] which is a contradiction since all numbers are unique. Thus, exactly 6 sums can be 20. 8. **Examining Critical Condition:** To maintain the sum of 234, the other six sums must be strictly 19: [ 6 times 20 + 6 times 19 = 234 ] Then sums alternate between 20 and 19, but this leads to: 9. **Absurdity in Structure:** Considering the sums involving groups like ( a_1, a_4, a_7, a_{10} ) (figure 1 from the problem): [ |a_4 - a_7| geq 2 Rightarrow |S_5 - S_6| = |a_4 + a_5 + a_6 - (a_5 + a_6 + a_7)| geq 2 ] This adjacency contradiction shows that not all sums can be 20 or lesser, proving there must be a sum greater than 20. 10. **Final Conclusion:** Therefore, the arrangement necessitates a maximum sum greater than 20, and examination of figures supports that: [ boxed{21} ]"},{"prompt":"A can do a work in 9 days. B can do the same work in 18 days. If both A and B are working together, in how many days will they finish the work?","completion":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work rates. The work rate is the fraction of the work completed in one day. A can complete the work in 9 days, so A's work rate is 1/9 of the work per day. B can complete the work in 18 days, so B's work rate is 1/18 of the work per day. When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate = A's work rate + B's work rate Combined work rate = (1/9) + (1/18) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 18 in this case: Combined work rate = (2/18) + (1/18) Combined work rate = 3/18 We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: Combined work rate = (3 ÷ 3) / (18 ÷ 3) Combined work rate = 1/6 This means that A and B working together can complete 1/6 of the work in one day. To find out how many days it will take for them to finish the work, we take the reciprocal of the combined work rate: Days to finish the work = 1 / (Combined work rate) Days to finish the work = 1 / (1/6) Days to finish the work = 6 Therefore, A and B working together will finish the work in boxed{6} days."},{"prompt":"triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Let's denote b+c=4k, c+a=5k, and a+b=6k. From these equations, we can derive the values of a, b, and c. First, adding the first two equations gives 2c + a + b = 9k. From a + b = 6k, we can substitute to find 2c + 6k = 9k, which simplifies to c = 1.5k. Similarly, by adding the appropriate pairs of equations and substituting, we find a = 3.5k and b = 2.5k. For option A, using the Law of Sines, frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. Thus, sin A:sin B:sin C = a:b:c = 7:5:3. Therefore, we conclude boxed{text{A is correct}}. For option B, considering the dot product overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{AB}, we use the formula involving cosines, overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{AC} = bccos A. The cosine of angle A can be found using the Law of Cosines, giving cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}.

Official Solution: First, we assume without loss of generality that AB < AC and aim to show that angle PQE = 90^circ. **Step 1:** Claim that D, P, E are collinear. To prove this, let N be the midpoint of overline{AB}. It is well-known (e.g., from problem 6 of USAJMO 2014) that the three lines MN, DE, and AI are concurrent at a point. Let P' be this intersection point, noting that P' actually lies on the segment overline{DE}. **Step 2:** We have triangle DP'M sim triangle DEC, implying MP' = MD.

Therefore, D, P, E are collinear. **Step 3:** Let S be the point diametrically opposite D on the incircle, making S the second intersection of line AQ with the incircle. Let T = overline{AQ} cap overline{BC}. Since T is the contact point of the A-excircle, we have MD = MP = MT. This indicates that D, P, T are concyclic on a circle with diameter overline{DT}. **Step 4:** Since angle DQT = angle DQS = 90^circ, point Q lies on this circle as well.

Thus, we conclude that boxed{angle PQE = 90^circ}. # Using Spiral Similarity: **Step 1:** Define points S and T as before and note that overline{AQS} is collinear. Points D, P, Q, T form a cyclic quadrilateral on the circle omega with diameter overline{DT}. **Step 2:** Consider the spiral similarity tau centered at Q that maps circle omega to the incircle. We have tau(T) = D, tau(D) = S, and tau(Q) = Q. **Step 3:** The intersection point I of overline{DD} and overline{QQ} satisfies tau(I) = overline{SS} cap overline{QQ}. Thus, tau(I) is the pole of overline{ASQT} with respect to the incircle, implying it lies on line EF. **Step 4:** Since overline{AI} perp overline{EF}, it follows that tau maps line AI to line EF. Hence, tau(P) must map to either E or F. **Conclusion 2:** This implies that P maps to either E or F, giving us either boxed{angle PQE = 90^circ} or boxed{angle PQF = 90^circ}.

Therefore, the circle intersects the two adjacent sides of the rectangle and also cuts through the longer side. 2. **Label the Points:** Let the rectangle be (ABCD), with circle centered at point (O). The points where the circle touches the rectangle are labeled as follows: - (K) and (M) are the points where the circle touches the sides (AD) and (AB) respectively. - The points of intersection of the circle with the sides (BC) and (CD) need to be determined. 3. **Observations:** - Since the radius of the circle is (26), and it touches the sides (AD) and (AB), the segments (AK) and (BM) are both (26). 4. **Construct and Solve Right Triangle:** In the configuration where the circle intersects both the adjacent sides, the circle will form a square with its radius from the touching points to the center of the circle. Let's consider coordinates: - ( O = (26,26) ) - ( K = (26, 0) ) - ( M = (0, 26) ) 5. **Determine Remaining Segments:** - From the figure, the triangle (OLH) forms a right triangle where (O) is the center of the circle, and (L) and (H) are the points where the circle touches opposite sides (BC) and (CD) respectively. - ( O ) has coordinates ((26,26)) Using the Pythagorean Theorem in ( triangle OLH ): [ OH^2 + LH^2 = OL^2 ] Where (HO) is derived from the circle's radius subtracting 26 from the total distance length. 6. **Calculate Lengths:** - The calculation is straightforward solving for the unknown side of triangle (OLH): [ OL = 26, OH = 10, ] [ LH = sqrt{OL^2 - OH^2} = sqrt{26^2 - 10^2} = sqrt{676 - 100} = sqrt{576} = 24 ] 7. **Segments along Rectangle:** - Thus the segments dividing side ( AD = 36 ) results into splits: [ AP = AL = 2, LH = 24 , and finally 24, 2 ] - Similar analogy calculates for further sides (120 26), further segmentations results accordance maintaining intersection points. # Conclusion: The circle divides the sides of the rectangle into the segments of: [ 2, 48 , 10 26 and 34, 26 and 10 ] [ boxed{26{text { and }} 34; 26{text { and }} 10; 2, 48{text { and }} 10.} ]"},{"prompt":"The following numbers: |1|, 3^{2}, (frac{1}{2})^{3}, (frac{2}{3})^{2}, left(1right)^{2021}, among them, the negative numbers are ( ).

The midpoint formula gives us the coordinates of M as Mleft(frac{x_A + x_B}{2}, frac{y_A + y_B}{2}right) = (2,2). Given that M is the midpoint of AB, and the coordinates of M are (2,2), we can deduce that the line AB is parallel to the axis of the parabola (the x-axis) because the y-coordinate of M is the average of the y-coordinates of A and B, which are equal since M's y-coordinate is a constant value (2 in this case). This implies that A and B are symmetric with respect to the axis of the parabola. The equation of the parabola is y^2 = 4x. Substituting y = 2 into the equation gives x = 1. Therefore, the x-coordinates of A and B are both 1 unit away from the x-coordinate of M, which is 2. This means the x-coordinates of A and B are 3 and 1, respectively, or vice versa. Since the parabola is symmetric with respect to its axis, and A and B are on opposite sides of the axis, their y-coordinates are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. Given M's y-coordinate is 2, the y-coordinates of A and B are both 2. Therefore, the points A and B are (3,2) and (1,2), respectively. The distance AB can be calculated using the distance formula, which gives AB = 2 units. The distance AF and BF can be calculated similarly, giving AF = sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (2-0)^2} = sqrt{8} and BF = sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (2-0)^2} = 2.

Taking AB as the base and the perpendicular distance from F to line AB as the height (which is 2 units, the y-coordinate of F), the area of triangle ABF is frac{1}{2} times 2 times 2 = 2 square units.

The difference in total age due to the replacement of the two men is the age of the two new men minus the age of the two men who were replaced. So, the equation representing this change is: 15 * (A + 2) - 15 * A = (Age of new man 1 + Age of new man 2) - (21 + 23) Simplifying the equation: 15A + 30 - 15A = (Age of new man 1 + Age of new man 2) - 44 The 15A terms cancel out, leaving us with: 30 = (Age of new man 1 + Age of new man 2) - 44 Now, we add 44 to both sides to find the total age of the two new men: 30 + 44 = Age of new man 1 + Age of new man 2 74 = Age of new man 1 + Age of new man 2 Therefore, the combined age of the two new men is 74 years.

Therefore, D_1 = 0. - For n = 2, the only permutation is {2, 1}, which is a derangement as a_1 neq 1 and a_2 neq 2.

Therefore, the smallest number of colors required is 3. We need to determine if we can necessarily use fewer than 3 colors: - Note that 8 is a multiple of 4 and 2, while 4 is a multiple of 2, thus 2, 4, and 8 must have different colors to satisfy the given conditions. - Thus, at least 3 different colors are mandatory to color the numbers 2, 4, and 8 differently. Hence the smallest integer k needed to color the integers from 2 to 8 is: boxed{3} 2) Coloring integers between 2 and 31: Now extend our analysis for integers from 2 to 31. Firstly, observe that the critical requirement arises from the multiples of 2 and their powers because they are the most restrictive (many numbers need different colors): Considering powers of 2 between 2 and 31: - 2, 4, 8, 16 These are four powers of 2, and they give us a clue that potentially four colors may be needed due to them being sequential multiples. Let's construct the color assignment based on this idea: To ensure different coloring: 1. 2 must be a different color from its higher multiples: - 4, 8, 16 2. 4 must differ from: - 8, 16 3. 8 must differ from: - 16 Each power of 2 up to 16 requires a unique color: - Color(2) neq Color(4) - Color(4) neq Color(8) - Color(8) neq Color(16) Therefore, at least 4 different colors are needed to color appropriately in this range. Next we need to demonstrate that coloring integers 2 to 31 using exactly 4 colors can be accomplished: 1. Assign color 1 to these integers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 2. Assign color 2 to these: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26 3. Assign color 3 to these: 8, 12, 18, 20, 27, 28, 30 4.

A: Sufficient but not necessary condition B: Necessary but not sufficient condition C: Necessary and sufficient condition D: Neither necessary nor sufficient conditio","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break down the analysis step by step: 1. **Understanding the concept of monotonicity:** If a function f(x) is strictly increasing on an interval, say [0,1], this means for any x_1, x_2 in [0,1] with x_1 < x_2, we have f(x_1) < f(x_2). By this definition, the largest value the function can attain on this interval is at the rightmost point of the interval, which is f(1). 2. **Analyzing sufficiency:** Given that f(x) strictly increases on [0,1], we conclude that the maximum value of f(x) on this interval is indeed f(1). This shows that the statement \\"Function f(x) strictly increases on [0,1]\\" suffices to ensure that the maximum value of the function on [0,1] is f(1). 3. **Examining necessity by counterexample:** To test if having the maximum value of f(x) on [0,1] being f(1) necessitates that f(x) is strictly increasing, consider the function f(x) = |x - frac{1}{3}|. This function attains its maximum at x=0 or x=1, specifically f(1), but it is not strictly increasing over the entire interval [0,1] because it decreases from x=0 to x=frac{1}{3} before increasing again. Hence, the function having its maximum value at f(1) does not necessarily mean it is strictly increasing on [0,1]. From the above analysis, we conclude that the statement \\"Function f(x) strictly increases on [0,1]\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"The maximum value of function f(x) on [0,1] is f(1)\\".

A certain appliance store is preparing to purchase a batch of humidifiers. The cost price of each unit is 80 yuan. After market research, the selling price is set at 100 yuan per unit. The store can sell 500 units per day. For every 1 yuan increase in price, the daily sales volume will decrease by 10 units. Let x represent the increase in price per unit. (1) If the daily sales volume is denoted by y units, write down the relationship between y and x directly. (2) Express the profit W in yuan obtained by the store from selling each humidifier per day using an algebraic expression involving x. Calculate the selling price per unit that maximizes profit. What is the maximum profit obtained?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Relationship Between y and x Given that the base daily sales volume is 500 units and for every 1 yuan increase in price, the daily sales volume decreases by 10 units, we can directly write the relationship between y (daily sales volume) and x (increase in price per unit) as: [y = 500 - 10x] Part 2: Expressing and Maximizing Profit W The profit W obtained from selling each humidifier per day can be expressed as the product of the profit per unit and the number of units sold per day. The profit per unit is the selling price per unit minus the cost price per unit, which is (100 + x - 80), and the number of units sold per day is given by y = 500 - 10x. Therefore, the expression for W is: [W = (100 + x - 80)(500 - 10x)] Simplifying this expression: [ begin{align*} W &= (20 + x)(500 - 10x) &= 20 cdot 500 + 500x - 10x cdot 20 - 10x^2 &= 10000 + 500x - 200x - 10x^2 &= -10x^2 + 300x + 10000 end{align*} ] To make it easier to find the maximum value of W, we can complete the square: [ begin{align*} W &= -10x^2 + 300x + 10000 &= -10(x^2 - 30x) + 10000 &= -10(x^2 - 30x + 225) + 10000 + 10 cdot 225 &= -10(x - 15)^2 + 12250 end{align*} ] From this form, it's clear that W reaches its maximum value when x = 15, because the square of a real number is always non-negative, and the negative sign in front of the square term means the expression is maximized when the square term is minimized, which is 0 when x = 15. Thus, the maximum profit W is: [W_{text{max}} = -10(15 - 15)^2 + 12250 = 12250] To maximize profit, the selling price per unit should be set at 100 + 15 = 115 yuan.

Given that a_8=a_6+2a_4, We have a_1q^7=a_1q^5+2a_1q^3. Dividing both sides by a_1q^3 (note that a_1 > 0 and q > 0, so a_1q^3 neq 0), we obtain: q^4=q^2+2. Let x=q^2, then the equation becomes x^2=x+2, which simplifies to x^2-x-2=0. This is a quadratic equation, and by factoring, we have (x-2)(x+1)=0. Since q>0, we discard the negative root x=-1.

We start by extending the property given: f(x+2) = -f(x) When applying this property twice, we can derive: f(x+4) = -f(x+2) = -(-f(x)) = f(x) This tells us that the period of the function f(x) is 4. 2. Now, let's find the function values at specific points: Using the fact that the period is 4: f(2016) = f(2016 mod 4) = f(0) Since f(x) is an odd function, f(0) must be equal to 0. So, we have f(2016) = f(0) = 0. 3. Next, we need to evaluate f(2015): Again, applying the periodic property: f(2015) = f(2015 mod 4) = f(-1) Using the fact that f(x) is odd, we can relate f(-1) to f(1), which we know: f(1) = 2^1 = 2 Therefore, as f(x) is odd, we have: f(-1) = -f(1) = -2 4.

Under these substitutions, the equation becomes: [ sum_{text{cyc}} fleft(frac{b+c}{a}right) = 1 ] 2. **Introducing a New Function**: Let's introduce a new function ( g ) by defining ( f(t) = gleft(frac{1}{t+1}right) ). Equivalently, we can express this as ( g(s) = fleft(frac{1}{s} - 1right) ). Note that this substitution transforms the function ( g : (0, 1) rightarrow (0, 1) ).

This implies ( h(1/2) = 0 ). - Similarly: [ h(t) = h(t) + h(1/2) = 2hleft(frac{t}{2} + frac{1}{4}right) = h(t + 1/2) + h(0) = h(t + 1/2) ] - Since ( h ) is periodic with period 1/2, extend ( tilde{h} ) as: [ tilde{h}: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R}, quad tilde{h}(t) = h(t - lfloor t rfloor) ] 6. **Exploring Additivity**: - Because ( tilde{h}(0) = 0 ), Jensen's functional equation implies ( tilde{h} ) is additive: [ tilde{h}(x + y) = 2tilde{h}left(frac{x+y}{2}right) = tilde{h}(x) + tilde{h}(y) ] - Given that ( tilde{h} ) is bounded below on ([0,1]) and additive, ( tilde{h} ) is linear.

The total work done by 8 boys in one day is ( 8B ) and the total work done by 4 girls in one day is ( 4G ). So, the total work done by 8 boys and 4 girls in one day is ( 8B + 4G ). Since ( B = G ) (because the work done by 16 boys in 6 days is the same as the work done by 24 girls in 6 days), we can say that ( 8B + 4G = 12B ) (or ( 12G )). Now, if 16 boys can construct the wall in 6 days, then 8 boys (which is half the number of boys) will take twice the time, which is 12 days. Since ( 8B + 4G = 12B ), it means that 8 boys and 4 girls will also take 12 days to construct the wall.

What is the cost of raising corn per acre?","completion":"Let's denote the cost of raising corn per acre as ( C ) dollars. We know that the Willey Farm Collective has 4500 acres of land and plans to plant 3400 acres of wheat. This means that the remaining land for corn is ( 4500 - 3400 = 1100 ) acres. The cost of planting wheat is given as 35 dollars per acre. Since they are planting 3400 acres of wheat, the total cost for wheat is ( 3400 times 35 ). The total available capital is 165,200 dollars, which will be used for both corn and wheat. Therefore, the cost for corn will be the total capital minus the cost for wheat. So, we have the equation: [ 165,200 = (C times 1100) + (3400 times 35) ] Now, let's calculate the cost for wheat: [ 3400 times 35 = 119,000 ] Subtracting this from the total capital gives us the cost for corn: [ 165,200 - 119,000 = 46,200 ] Now we have the total cost for corn, which is for 1100 acres.

Additionally, no fish can eat another fish if that fish has already eaten an odd number of fish. 3. **Analysis by Assumption:** **Case 1: Assume the last remaining fish is a pike.** - The pikes eat the pikes with the restriction that no pike can eat another fish if it has eaten an odd number of fish earlier. - Let's assume all 7 pikes have eaten 1 pike each, which isn't possible because we have 7 fish and would need an even number of fish to evenly distribute the pike eating among the pikes themselves. Therefore, a single odd number of eaten pikes will prevent even one pike from being the last fish due to the consumption restrictions. 4. **Contradiction:** If a pike can't be left due to its odd number consumption restrictions, the next possible fish must be considered. 5. **Case 2: Assume the last remaining fish is a perch.** - Let’s recount and see if perch could logically be the last standing. - Pikes are eaten by perches and pikes eat perch, but similarly per the odd rule restriction once pike has eaten an odd amount – it can't be eaten by a perch again. This an impossible scenario as well because it sets an odd restriction and there is not a structured order for perches to be the last standing fish naturally. Conclusion with Contradiction above being evident: 6. **Case 3: Now, consider the Sudak (common pike-perch) to be the last remaining fish logically:** - As all fighters in the pond, if the final odd-numbered rule applies consecutively, the mechanics imply that eventually one Sudak won't be consumed by others owing to even-eating rules before odd consumption ends. Let's group the cumulative patterns: Out of all pikes consuming assigned, and perches too, only logically; a Sudak stands to be consumed rightfully last owing to balance left conclusively. # Conclusion: The fish that remains in the swamp is the Sudak based upon the even-odd eating array patterns and overall consumption rulesets.

Here is the upper bound step-by-step: 5. **Detailed Example Construction**: - Start with five piles each containing 2 stones: [ (2, 2, 2, 2, 2) ] - Perform the following transformations: [ (2, 2, 2, 2, 2) rightarrow (3, 1, 2, 2, 2) rightarrow (3, 1, 3, 1, 2) rightarrow (3, 1, 4, 1, 1) rightarrow (5, 1, 2, 1, 1) ] 6. **Next Step**: - Consider three single-stone piles, replace them with three double-stone piles and continue: [ (5, 2, 2, 2, 2) rightarrow (5, 1, 3, 2, 2) rightarrow (5, 1, 4, 1, 2) rightarrow (7, 1, 2, 1, 2) ] 7. **Further Steps**: - Reduce two single-stone piles, replace them with two double-stone piles: [ (7, 2, 2, 2, 2) rightarrow (7, 1, 3, 2, 2) rightarrow (7, 1, 4, 1, 2) rightarrow (7, 1, 5, 1, 1) rightarrow (9, 1, 2, 1, 1) ] 8. **Final Large Pile Collection**: - Continue the similar procedure until we accumulate 2007 stones in the largest pile: [ (2007, 2, 2, 2) rightarrow (2007, 1, 3, 2) rightarrow (2007, 1, 4, 1) rightarrow (2009, 1, 2, 1) rightarrow (2010, 1, 1, 1) ] 9. **Conclusion**: - From this, it is evident that the greatest number of stones in a single pile that can be achieved is 2010.

The common difference (d) in this arithmetic sequence is 2. 2. **Calculate the Number of Terms (n):** The general form for the n^{text{th}} term of an arithmetic sequence is given by: [ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d ] Setting a_n = 400 (last term), and substituting a_1 = 200 (first term) and d = 2, we get: [ 400 = 200 + (n-1)2 ] [ 200 = (n-1)2 implies n-1 = 100 implies n = 101 ] 3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:** The sum S_n of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is: [ S_n = frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n) ] Plugging in the values we have: [ S_n = frac{101}{2} times (200 + 400) = frac{101}{2} times 600 = 101 times 300 = 30300 ] Thus, the sum of all the even integers between 200 and 400 inclusive is boxed{30300}."},{"prompt":"Let n be a positive integer.

There are ( 2^n ) such vectors. Each element of these vectors can be either 0 or 1. Let's denote these vectors as rows in our table. 3. **Verifying the Condition:** For any two different binary vectors (left[ a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n right]) and (left[ b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n right]), since they are different, there exists at least one position ( i ) where ( a_i neq b_i ). In binary vectors, this difference is exactly 1.

Now, we need to prove that ( m ) cannot be greater than ( 2^n ). 5. **Proof by Contradiction:** Assume ( m > 2^n ). This means we have more than ( 2^n ) rows. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two rows must be identical in some columns, which would violate the condition that the maximum absolute difference between corresponding elements is exactly 1.

Show that the third vertex has rational coordinates if and only if each angle X of the triangle either satisfies X = 90^circ or tan(X) is rational. To solve the problem, we break it into two parts. First, we show that if all the coordinates are rational and the angles satisfy certain conditions, then the third vertex is rational. Secondly, we show that if the angles have rational tangents (or are 90^circ), then the third vertex must also have rational coordinates. 1. **Assume the vertices and angles:** Let the vertices be ( P_1 = (x_1, y_1) ), ( P_2 = (x_2, y_2) ), and ( P_3 = (x_3, y_3) ). Suppose that ( P_1P_2 ) makes an angle (alpha) with the x-axis and ( P_1P_3 ) makes an angle (beta) with the x-axis. 2. **Angles with the x-axis:** Since (tan(alpha)) and (tan(beta)) represent the slopes of lines ( P_1P_2 ) and ( P_1P_3 ), they are rational because both pairs of coordinates are rational. 3. **Rational tangent conditions:** We have [ tan(alpha - beta) = frac{tan(alpha) - tan(beta)}{1 + tan(alpha) tan(beta)} ] Since (tan(alpha)) and (tan(beta)) are rational, the tangent of the difference of these angles, (tan(alpha - beta)), is also rational. 4. **Special case - angle (90^circ):** If (alpha) or (beta) is (90^circ), then (tan(alpha)) or (tan(beta)) is undefined (or infinite). - Considering (cot(alpha)) instead of (tan(alpha)), (cot(alpha) = 0) if (alpha = 90^circ). - Example: If (alpha = 90^circ) and (beta = 0^circ), then it is clear that (alpha - beta = 90^circ). 5. **Independent slopes leading to rational coordinates:** Next, suppose all angles have rational (or infinite) tangents, and two vertices ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) have rational coordinates. 6. **Equation formulation:** [ text{Let }frac{y_3 - y_1}{x_3 - x_1} = h quad text{and} quad frac{y_3 - y_2}{x_3 - x_2} = k ] where (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, h,) and (k) are all rational. 7. **System of equations:** These give us two simultaneous equations with rational coefficients: [ y_3 - y_1 = h(x_3 - x_1) ] and [ y_3 - y_2 = k(x_3 - x_2) ] 8. **Solving the equations:** Since ( h neq k ) (as the triangle cannot have two parallel sides), we can solve these simultaneous equations for (x_3) and (y_3), yielding rational solutions for (x_3) and (y_3). # Conclusion: The third vertex has rational coordinates if and only if each angle (X) of the triangle satisfies (X = 90^circ) or (tan(X)) is rational.

We need to find a value for the amplitude A such that A sin(x) has a range of left[-frac{1}{2}, 1right].

However, this value does not satisfy the second equation, meaning that we cannot find a simple sine function with amplitude A to match the given range. Instead, let's consider a shifted and scaled sine function of the form f(x) = A sin(x - b) + c.

Knowing that the total area to the left of the mean (X = 1) is 0.5 for any normal distribution, and combining it with the area between 1 and 3: P(X < 3) = P(X < 1) + P(1 < X < 3) P(X < 3) = 0.5 + 0.3 P(X < 3) = 0.8 So the correct answer is boxed{0.8}."},{"prompt":"Prove that on a coordinate plane it is impossible to draw a closed broken line such that coordinates of each vertex are rational, the length of its every edge is equal to 1 , the line has an odd number of vertices.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to prove that it is impossible to draw a closed broken line on a coordinate plane with the following properties: - The coordinates of each vertex are rational. - The length of each edge is equal to 1. - The line has an odd number of vertices. 2. **Using Pythagoras' Theorem:** By Pythagoras' theorem, for any edge of length 1 between two points ((x_1, y_1)) and ((x_2, y_2)), we have: [ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = 1 ] This implies that the difference in coordinates must satisfy: [ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 = 1 ] The possible values for ((x_2 - x_1)) and ((y_2 - y_1)) are ((pm 1, 0)) or ((0, pm 1)) or ((pm frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, pm frac{1}{sqrt{2}})). However, since we are dealing with rational coordinates, the only valid differences are ((pm 1, 0)) and ((0, pm 1)). 3. **Parity Argument:** Assume we start at a point ((x_0, y_0)) where both (x_0) and (y_0) are rational. Without loss of generality, we can assume (x_0) and (y_0) are integers (since any rational number can be scaled to an integer). 4. **Parity of Coordinates:** Each move changes either the (x)-coordinate or the (y)-coordinate by (pm 1). Therefore, each move changes the parity of the sum (x + y). Specifically: - If we move horizontally (change (x) by (pm 1)), the parity of (x + y) changes. - If we move vertically (change (y) by (pm 1)), the parity of (x + y) changes. 5. **Odd Number of Moves:** Since the line has an odd number of vertices, it has an odd number of edges. Starting from ((x_0, y_0)), after an odd number of moves, the parity of (x + y) will have changed an odd number of times. Therefore, the parity of (x + y) at the final vertex will be different from the parity of (x + y) at the starting vertex. 6. **Contradiction:** For the line to be closed, the final vertex must coincide with the starting vertex. This means the sum (x + y) at the final vertex must be the same as the sum (x + y) at the starting vertex. However, we have shown that the parity of (x + y) changes after an odd number of moves, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, it is impossible to draw such a closed broken line with the given properties.

For the interval [-7, -3], which is symmetric to [3, 7], and for any y_1, y_2 in [-7, -3] with y_1 < y_2, we have: y_1 = -x_2 y_2 = -x_1 Applying the property of the odd function, we have: f(y_1) = f(-x_2) = -f(x_2) f(y_2) = f(-x_1) = -f(x_1) Since f(x_1) < f(x_2), it follows that -f(x_2) < -f(x_1), and therefore f(y_1) < f(y_2) for y_1 < y_2.

Therefore, there is exactly one real root ( x_0 ) in this interval. 5. **Nature of the Polynomial:** The polynomial ( f(x) = x^3 + x + 1 ) is strictly increasing for all real ( x ). This is immediate by examining its derivative ( f'(x) = 3x^2 + 1 ), which is always positive as ( 3x^2 + 1 > 0 ) for all ( x ). Thus, ( f(x) = 0 ) has exactly one real root. 6. **Complex Roots:** Let the other two roots be ( z_1 ) and ( bar{z}_1 ). According to Vieta’s formulas, the product of the roots of the polynomial ( z_1 cdot bar{z}_1 cdot x_0 = -1 ). 7. Therefore, [ |z_1 cdot bar{z}_1 cdot x_0| = |-1| = 1 ] Given ( bar{z}_1 ) is the complex conjugate of ( z_1 ), ( |z_1| = |bar{z}_1| ). Let ( |z_1| = r ).

First, we observe that angle B = angle PTQ because they are both right angles. Also, we can determine the measure of angle TPQ by subtracting the measures of angle QPA and angle APB from 180^circ, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ. Given that angle APD = 90^circ, it follows that angle TPQ = 180^circ - angle QPA - angle APB = 90^circ - angle APB = angle BAP. This implies that triangle BAP sim triangle TPQ by AA similarity (two angles are equal). Given the similarity and the side lengths of triangle PQA where PA=20, AQ=25, and QP=15, we recognize a 3-4-5 Pythagorean triplet, which suggests that triangle BAP and triangle TPQ are also 3-4-5 right triangles.

Given that the digits 1, 9, 8, and 7 have all appeared, this implies the sequence cannot solely consist of the cyclic pattern from the multiples of 23, as it would need to make use of all possible digit segments including those from multiples of 17 at least once.

Since the highest degree term is -nx^{2}y^{m+1} and its coefficient must be 8, we have: [ -n = 8 ] Solving this equation gives us: [ n = -8 ] Therefore, the values of m and n are m = 4 and n = -8, encapsulated as boxed{m = 4, n = -8}. # Part 2: Rearranging the Polynomial in Descending Powers of x Given the values of m and n as 4 and -8 respectively, we substitute these into the original polynomial to get: [ 8x^{2}y^{5} + xy^{2} - 3x^{5} - 6 ] To rearrange this polynomial in descending powers of x, we order the terms from the highest power of x to the lowest: [ -3x^{5} + 8x^{2}y^{5} + xy^{2} - 6 ] Thus, the polynomial arranged in descending powers of x is boxed{-3x^{5} + 8x^{2}y^{5} + xy^{2} - 6}."},{"prompt":"Let f(x)=left{{begin{array}{l}{ax+1, x<a}{{{({x2})}^2}, xgeq a}end{array}}right..

This means as x decreases, f(x) increases, and there is no minimum value for f(x) in this interval. Therefore, this case does not satisfy the requirement of having a minimum value for f(x). 2. **Case 2: a = 0** For x < 0, f(x) = 1. For x geq 0, f(x) = (x-2)^2. The minimum value of (x-2)^2 is 0 when x = 2. Therefore, f(x) has a minimum value of 0 at x = 2, and for x < 0, f(x) = 1. This case meets the requirement as f(x) has a minimum value. 3. **Case 3: 0 < a < 2** In this interval, f(x) is monotonically decreasing for x < a and for a < x < 2, and monotonically increasing for x > 2. For f(x) to have a minimum value, the condition -a^2 + 1 geq f(2) = 0 must hold. Solving this inequality gives -1 leq a leq 1.

However, this inequality has no solution in this interval, indicating that f(x) does not have a minimum value for a geq 2. **Conclusion:** Considering all cases, the interval for a where f(x) has a minimum value is [0, 1].

By doing so, Player 2 lowers the potential sum significantly: - Every 3 times 3 block will have at least 3 zeros if 0s are placed effectively in 1 times 2 rectangles. \`\`\` Example Block: [0, 1, 1] [1, 0, 1] [1, 1, 0] This pattern ensures that the effective filler sum (3 times (1,1))+remaining 1's=6 \`\`\` - Hence, if there are 3 zeros, the maximum sum in any 3 times 3 sub-grid would be 6. 5. **Player 1's Counter Strategy:** Now, for Player 1 to maximize the sum in any 3 times 3 sub-grid, optimal placements are central positions and spreading out 1s to avoid grouped zeros. - With Player 1 working to fill blocks to keep sums high across multiple squares. - These strategic moves will make achieving 9 impossible due to antagonist's zeros. 6. **Conclusion:** - Player 2 forces minimal through zero (at least 3) effectively reduces summable counts down. - Player 1 maximizes within reduced feasible not less 6. - Hence, theoretically summing is optimized up to (6) amidst minimization interferences. Thus, both players' strategies lead to maximizing at 6 for the sum in an occupied mistral board 3 times 3. So, the maximum value A that Player 1 can ensure is [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"The length of the bridge, which a train 160 metres long and travelling at 45 km/hr can cross in 30 seconds, is what?","completion":"First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s because the length of the train and the time taken to cross the bridge are given in meters and seconds, respectively. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 45 * (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 45 * (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now, we know the speed of the train and the time it takes to cross the bridge. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The distance the train covers in 30 seconds at 12.5 m/s is: Distance = 12.5 m/s * 30 s Distance = 375 m This distance is the combined length of the train and the bridge. Since we know the length of the train is 160 meters, we can find the length of the bridge by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance: Length of the bridge = Distance - Length of the train Length of the bridge = 375 m - 160 m Length of the bridge = 215 m Therefore, the length of the bridge is boxed{215} meters."},{"prompt":"a 120item exam, Lowella got 35% of the questions correctly.

Therefore, a_{n+1} + 1 = (a_n + 1)^2. Since a_1 = 2, we get a_n + 1 > 1. Taking the logarithm on both sides, we obtain lg(1+a_{n+1}) = 2lg(1+a_n). This implies frac{lg(1+a_{n+1})}{lg(1+a_n)} = 2. Hence, the sequence {lg(1+a_n)} is a geometric sequence with common ratio 2. (2) Since lg(1+a_n) = 2^{n-1} cdot lg(1+a_1) = 2^{n-1} lg 3 = lg 3^{2^{n-1}}. We then have 1+a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}} and thus a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}} - 1. For T_n, we get T_n = (1+a_1)(1+a_2)ldots(1+a_n) = 3^{2^0} cdot 3^{2^1} cdot 3^{2^2} ldots 3^{2^{n-1}} = 3^{1+2+2^2+ldots+2^{n-1}} = 3^{2^n - 1}. Therefore, the general term of the sequence {a_n} is a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}} - 1 and T_n is boxed{T_n = 3^{2^n - 1}}. (3) Using the equation a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + 2a_n, we can rewrite it as a_{n+1} = a_n(a_n + 2). Thus frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{a_n} - frac{1}{a_n + 2}right) and frac{1}{a_n + 2} = frac{1}{a_n} - frac{2}{a_{n+1}}. With the definition of b_n, we have b_n = frac{1}{a_n} + frac{1}{a_n + 2} = 2left( frac{1}{a_n} - frac{1}{a_{n+1}}right). Hence, for the sum of the first n terms S_n, we get S_n = b_1 + b_2 + ldots + b_n = 2left( frac{1}{a_1} - frac{1}{a_{n+1}}right). Since a_n = 3^{2^{n-1}} - 1, a_1 = 2, and a_{n+1} = 3^{2^n} - 1, we find S_n = 1 - frac{2}{3^{2^n} - 1}.

The first dress will have a 30% discount, so the price after the discount will be: ( d - 0.30d = 0.70d ) 2. The second dress will have a 50% discount, so the price after the discount will be: ( d - 0.50d = 0.50d ) 3. The third dress will have a 60% discount, so the price after the discount will be: ( d - 0.60d = 0.40d ) Now, let's add up the discounted prices for the three dresses: ( 0.70d + 0.50d + 0.40d = 1.60d ) Staff members get an additional 50% reduction on the lowest discounted price. The lowest discounted price is for the third dress, which is ( 0.40d ). The 50% reduction on this price is: ( 0.50 times 0.40d = 0.20d ) Now, we subtract this additional staff discount from the total price of the three dresses: ( 1.60d - 0.20d = 1.40d ) Next, we apply the 10% sales tax on the discounted price: ( 1.40d times 0.10 = 0.14d ) Adding the sales tax to the discounted price: ( 1.40d + 0.14d = 1.54d ) Finally, we need to consider the 5% environmental surcharge on the original price of each dress over 100. Since we don't know if ( d ) is over 100, we'll have to consider two cases: Case 1: If ( d ) is 100 or less, there is no environmental surcharge, and the final price is ( 1.54d ). Case 2: If ( d ) is over 100, the environmental surcharge is applied to each dress: ( 3 times 0.05d = 0.15d ) Adding the environmental surcharge to the price with sales tax: ( 1.54d + 0.15d = 1.69d ) So, the final price a staff member would have to pay for three dresses in terms of ( d ) is ( 1.54d ) if ( d ) is boxed{100} or less, and ( 1.69d ) if ( d ) is over 100."},{"prompt":"**Elective 45: Special Topics on Inequalities** Given real numbers x, y, z satisfying x^2+y^2+z^2=1.

The total number of matches that can be played in such a format can be calculated using the combination formula frac{x(x-1)}{2}, where x is the total number of teams. This is because each team plays x-1 matches (against every other team), and we divide by 2 to avoid counting each match twice (once for each team). Given that a total of 28 matches were played, we set up the equation: [ frac{x(x-1)}{2} = 28 ] Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the denominator: [ x(x-1) = 56 ] Expanding and rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation: [ x^2 - x - 56 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we look for values of x that satisfy the equation.

An odd function satisfies the condition f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain of f. This means that the graph of an odd function has rotational symmetry about the origin (0,0). Given the function f(x) = frac{1-x}{1+x}, we can rewrite it to better understand its symmetry properties. Let's start by manipulating the expression for f(x): [ f(x) = frac{1-x}{1+x} = frac{-(x+1)+2}{1+x} = -1 + frac{2}{x+1} ] This shows that the function f(x) can be thought of as a transformation of frac{2}{x+1}, shifted down by 1 unit. The symmetric center of f(x), considering this transformation, is at (-1, -1). To find an odd function among the given options, we need to shift f(x) so that its symmetric center moves to the origin (0,0). This can be achieved by shifting the function one unit to the right and one unit up. Let's analyze the options: - **Option A: f(x-1) - 1** shifts f(x) one unit to the right and one unit down, not meeting our criteria. - **Option B: f(x-1) + 1** shifts f(x) one unit to the right and one unit up.

But this contradicts the given condition that the subsets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ) have non-empty intersections with each other. 6. **Condition on the number of subsets ( k < 2^{n-1} )**: Consider any pair of complementary subsets ( X ) and ( Y ) not included in ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ). Since all subsets in ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ) must have a non-empty intersection and no other subsets can intersect all of them, at least one subset ( A_i ) must be fully contained in one of the complementary subsets (e.g., ( A_i subseteq Y ) and ( A_j subseteq X )), leading to a contradiction because ( A_i ) and any ( A_j ) would have no intersection. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( k ) must exactly be ( 2^{n-1} ), as any deviation either exceeds the maximum feasible number of intersecting subsets or leads to contradictions with non-empty intersection conditions.

For a given integer n, n! is represented in decimal form, and we seek the first non-zero digit from the right in this representation. 2. We need to investigate whether there exists some natural number N such that the sequence a_{N+1}, a_{N+2}, a_{N+3}, ldots is periodic. 3. Assuming that such an N exists, let's denote the period of the sequence as T. We can theoretically express T as: [ T = 2^{alpha_1} cdot 5^{alpha_2} cdot p ] where alpha_1 and alpha_2 are non-negative integers and p is a prime that is co-prime with 10 (i.e., (p, 10) = 1). 4. Next, we select a natural number m geq max{alpha_1, alpha_2} and consider 10^m > N. This ensures that the power of 10 exceeds the supposed beginning of the periodic sequence. 5. Let k = m + varphi(p), where varphi(p) denotes the number of integers less than or equal to p that are co-prime with p (Euler’s totient function). 6.

The factorial of this large number can then be expressed as: [ (10^k)! = 10^k cdot (10^k - 1)! ] From this, using the definition of a_n, we deduce that: [ a_{10^k} = a_{10^k - 1} ] 8. With 10^k > 10^m > N, we can manipulate and obtain: [ a_{2 cdot 10^k} - 10^m = a_{2 cdot 10^k} - 10^m - 1 ] 9. Clearly, for 2 cdot 10^k - 10^m, the first non-zero digit must be 9.

Finally, to convert Betty's height into feet, we divide the number of inches by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): [ text{Betty's height in feet} = frac{36, text{inches}}{12} = 3, text{feet} ] Therefore, Betty is boxed{3} feet tall."},{"prompt":"Determine if the following statements are true: a) If a polygon can be divided by a broken line into two equal polygons, then it can be divided by a segment into two equal polygons. b) If a convex polygon can be divided by a broken line into two equal polygons, then it can be divided by a segment into two equal polygons. c) If a convex polygon can be divided by a broken line into two polygons that can be transformed into each other by an orientationpreserving movement (i.e., by rotation or parallel translation), then it can be divided by a segment into two polygons that can be transformed into each other by the same movement.","completion":"Part (a) To determine whether a polygon can always be divided into two equal polygons by a line segment if it can be divided by a broken line, let's look at an example. Consider the hexagon illustrated below: ![Hexagon Example](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_49e49f22191b45b40a57g-27.jpg?height=364&width=466&top_left_y=724&top_left_x=799) We need to prove that the hexagon in the illustration can't be divided into two equal polygons by a straight line. This is indeed true: 1. For the hexagon given, an equal division implies that the partition line must pass through vertex ( B ) (otherwise one polygon will have an angle greater than 180°, which the other won't). 2. The only cut through point ( B ) which would divide the hexagon into two polygons each having the same number of sides is the line segment ( AB ). 3. However, the cut along ( AB ) divides the hexagon into a rectangle and a not-parallelogram parallelogram (meaning one polygon is not a parallelogram). Thus, we conclude that the hexagon cannot be equitably divided by a line segment. This demonstrates that the statement in part (a) is false. Part (b) We'll provide a counterexample for the claim that any convex polygon that can be divided into two equal polygons by a broken line can also be divided by a straight line. Consider the following pentagon obtained from a (2 times 3) rectangle by cutting off two equal right-angled triangles with legs (1) and (2): ![Pentagon Example](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_49e49f22191b45b40a57g-27.jpg?height=320&width=1190&top_left_y=1624&top_left_x=434) We see that the pentagon is cut by a broken line into two equal hexagons. Yet, this pentagon can't be divided into two equal polygons by a straight line. The reasoning is as follows: 1. Any such straight cut must pass through a vertex and split the opposite side (to preserve equal numbers of sides). 2. The pentagon's sides include pairs of long and short sides as well as a single mid-length side. 3. Division cannot bisect a long side, as it would destroy the pairings. This leaves the midpoint of the middle side. An example calculation: - The middle-side split would force one resulting section to be a parallelogram and the other not, showing this isn't a valid straight-line split. Thus, this counterexample demonstrates that statement (b) is false. Part (c) Now consider the case where a convex polygon can be divided by a broken line into two polygons that can be transformed into each other by some motion preserving orientation (like rotation or translation). 1. Suppose polygon ( M ) is divided by a broken line ( A_1 ldots A_n ) into parts ( P ) and ( Q ), wherein motion ( Phi) (preserving orientation) transforms ( P ) into ( Q ). 2. Let ( Phi ) be a rotation or translation that maps internal angle ( A_2 ) of ( P ) to an equal angle in ( Q ). 3. This implies there’s a corresponding vertex ( A_2 ) in both ( P ) and ( Q ). Since ( A_2 ) is an internal point in the polygon, one angle has to be more than 180°, which isn't possible within a convex boundary. Thus, transformation ( Phi ) implies the polygon is centrally symmetric. Any line through the symmetry center divides ( M ) into equal polygons. Thus, statement (c) is true. # Conclusion: - Statement (a) is false. - Statement (b) is false. - Statement (c) is true.

Points within this circle satisfy x^2 + y^2 < 25, while points outside satisfy x^2 + y^2 > 25.

The integers that can come from the die roll range from 1 to 6. So, we need to count the outcomes where at least one of m or n is greater than 5. Since the maximum possible value on a die is 6, there is only one integer greater than 5.

We need to prove that the point Q, which is the intersection of the circumcircles of triangles APN and BPM (excluding P), lies on a fixed circle for any position of P on AB. 1. Denote the angle angle ACB = g. 2. From the parallelism of PM parallel AC and PN parallel BC, we have the following angle relations (by corresponding angles in parallel lines): [ angle AQP = angle ANP = angle ACB = g ] and [ angle BQP = angle BMP = angle ACB = g ] 3. Therefore, for any position of point P along the segment AB, the segment AB is viewed from point Q under a constant angle of 2g: [ angle AQB = 2g ] 4. This means that the points Q lie on a circle that sees AB at the angle 2g. 5. Hence, all lines PQ pass through a fixed point, which is the midpoint of the arc AB that does not contain Q.

The objective for player ( A ) is to place 11 consecutive ( times ) in a row, column, or diagonal, while player ( B ) aims to prevent this from happening. 2. **Create a Tiling Pattern:** We divide the infinite grid into repeated ( 4 times 4 ) square patterns. Each ( 4 times 4 ) square contains pre-defined marked cells (similar to a domino tiling pattern). 3. **Example of Tiling Pattern (Domino Tiling):** Let us take the ( 4 times 4 ) block and designate specific blocks to be filled in a way to prevent player ( A ) from ever achieving 11 ( times ) in any direction. 4. **Observation on Coverage:** Regardless of whether the sequence is horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, any line of 11 consecutive cells inevitably crosses through at least one of these ( 4 times 4 ) tiles. 5. **Player ( B )'s Strategy:** Whenever player ( A ) places a ( times ) in any of these cells, player ( B ) should immediately place a ( bigcirc ) in another designated cell within the same ( 4 times 4 ) tile block. 6. **Detailed Explanation:** Given the periodicity and structure of the tiling pattern, we ensure: - Every block within these ( 4 times 4 ) tiles contains at least one predetermined cell that can block any potential 11-in-a-row sequence. - By placing a ( bigcirc ) in these critical cells, player ( B ) effectively blocks any line player ( A ) attempts to form. 7. **Illustration and Formal Proof:** Consider the following layout representation: [ begin{matrix} 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 3 & 3 & 4 & 4 end{matrix} ] This matrix translates each 4-block representation.

Thus, the condition for the orthogonality of circles S and S_1 is: [ OO_{1}^{2} = R^{2} + R_{1}^{2} ] 3. **Calculate the power of a point**: The power of a point P with respect to a circle with center O and radius r is given by: [ text{Power of } P = OP^{2} - r^{2} ] Applying this to our situation, the power of the center O of the circle S relative to the circle S_{1} is: [ text{Power of } O text{ w.r.t. } S_{1} = OO_{1}^{2} - R_{1}^{2} ] 4. **Verification of orthogonality**: Since S is orthogonal to S_1, substitute OO_{1}^{2} = R^{2} + R_{1}^{2} into the expression for the power of O: [ text{Power of } O text{ w.r.t. } S_{1} = (R^{2} + R_{1}^{2}) - R_{1}^{2} = R^{2} ] Thus, the orthogonality of S and S_1 ensures that the power of O with respect to S_{1} is equal to R^{2}. 5. **Extend the property**: Now, assume that the circle S is also orthogonal to another circle S_{2} with center O_{2} and radius R_{2}.

Since O lies on this radical axis and the power of O relative to all these circles is R^2, any other circle S_{k} in the family will similarly have: [ text{Power of } O text{ w.r.t. } S_{k} = R^{2} ] Therefore, circle S with radius R is orthogonal to any circle S_{k} in the pencil. 8. **Concluding Statement**: We successfully proved that if a circle is orthogonal to two circles in a pencil, then it is orthogonal to all circles in that pencil.

Therefore, each place in these codes represents powers of 4. 2. **From BDA to BCA**: Since BDA + 1 = BCA, the last digit A implies a change from the highest digit in base-4 before rolling over, which should be 3. Thus, A = 3 and C = 0. 3. **From BCD to BDA**: This means D is one less than A; therefore D = 2. 4. **Determine the Values of B and Remaining Digits**: We know BDA + 1 = BCA impacts the middle digit, which means D = 2 (already found) rolls over from 3 to 0. Since B remains unchanged between consecutive codes and we’ve used digits 0, 2, and 3, the left digit B = 1, as it's the only unused digit for the base-4 system. 5. **Convert DAC from Base-4 to Base-10**: With D = 2, A = 3, and C = 0, the number DAC in base-4 is 230_4.

We need to find points where both (cos alpha) and (sin alpha) are rational numbers. 3. **Constructing Rational Points:** We can use the fact that there are infinitely many rational points on the unit circle. One way to construct such points is to use the parametrization of the unit circle with rational coordinates. For example, if ( alpha ) is chosen such that (cos alpha) and (sin alpha) are rational, then ( z = cos alpha + i sin alpha ) is a rational point on the unit circle. 4. **Distance Between Points:** Let ( z_A = cos alpha_A + i sin alpha_A ) and ( z_B = cos alpha_B + i sin alpha_B ) be two such points.

In scenarios 3 or 4, any of A, B, or C might be a spy, making it impossible for the judge to release any of them. Therefore, cases 3 and 4 are invalid. 2. **Step 2**: The person released from custody must be C, indicating that C is neither the spy nor the liar.

We need to analyze both scenarios: **Case 1**: - If the judge addressed A and A answered \\"yes\\" (indicating B is the spy), from the standpoint of A being the Knight, this is truthful. Thus, A as a Knight pointing to B as a spy is consistent. - If A answered \\"no,\\" B could either be the liar or the Knight (since we've excluded the spy case), rendering any definitive answers impossible and invalidating this case. **Case 2**: - Assume the judge asked B: - If B answered \\"yes\\" (A is not the spy), then B must be a Knight, making A the spy. This scenario is impossible since B is already known to be the spy. - If B answered \\"no,\\" the judge would know B is the spy-offering conclusive resolution. 5. **Summary and Concluding Step**: The release of C and contingent truthful/lie scenarios limit us to suspect and affirm: **Final Valid Scenarios**: - **Case 1a**: When A as the Knight asserts B is a spy. - **Case 1b**: When B as the spy asserts they are not the spy. **Intermediary Assertions**: - If judges confirmed answers as \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" definitively countered false-middle cases. 6. **Conclusion**: All examination pathways lead to B as the spy considering resultant true/false pathways post-A/C questions.

This is because the cosine function is decreasing in the interval 0^circ to 180^circ, which covers the possible range of angles in a triangle. So, we can write: [ cos A < cos B Rightarrow A > B ] 2. **Sine Relationship**: Knowing that A > B, we now consider the sine of these angles. Since the sine function increases in the interval 0^circ to 90^circ and then decreases from 90^circ to 180^circ, but always remains positive and reaches its peak at 90^circ, for angles in a triangle, we can say: [ A > B Rightarrow sin A > sin B ] This is because in a triangle, the larger the angle, the larger the sine of the angle up to 180^circ. 3. **Combining Relationships**: Combining the two observations, we have: [ cos A < cos B Leftrightarrow A > B Leftrightarrow sin A > sin B ] Therefore, we conclude that \\"cos A < cos B\\" is indeed a necessary and sufficient condition for \\"sin A > sin B\\".

How large can ( |S| ) be?","completion":"We are given a set ( S ) of irrational real numbers with the property that among any subset of five numbers in ( S ), one can find two with an irrational sum. We need to determine the maximum size of ( S ), denoted as ( |S| ). 1. **Example Construction:** We provide an example of a set ( S ) that satisfies the given criterion: [ S = { n pm sqrt{2} mid n = 1, 2, 3, 4 } ] Here, ( S ) contains 8 elements. Consider any subset of 5 elements from ( S ). Since each element is of the form ( n + sqrt{2} ) or ( n - sqrt{2} ), adding any two such elements where one is ( n + sqrt{2} ) and the other is ( m - sqrt{2} ) results in a rational number ( n + m ). Since we might pair elements resulting in irrational sums, this example set ensures that among any five elements, there are always two numbers whose sum is irrational. 2. **Graph Interpretation:** We represent the set ( S ) as a graph where each vertex is an element of ( S ). We draw an edge between two vertices if their sum is a rational number. 3. **Bipartite Property:** We claim that this graph is bipartite. To justify this, suppose there exists a cycle in the graph with an odd number of vertices (say ( n )). In such a cycle, let the vertices be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). The edges represent rational sums: [ a_1 + a_2, a_2 + a_3, ldots, a_{n-1} + a_n, a_n + a_1 ] Summing all these equations results in: [ (a_1 + a_2) + (a_2 + a_3) + cdots + (a_{n-1} + a_n) + (a_n + a_1) = 2(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n) ] Since the sum of rational numbers is rational, ( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n ) must also be rational. This implies all ( a_i )'s would need to be rational, which contradicts the premise that elements of ( S ) are irrational. 4. **2-Coloring and Size Constraint:** Therefore, the graph is bipartite and can be 2-colored. If ( |S| geq 9 ), a subset of 5 elements would exist in one of the color classes.

Step 1: Knight's Move Characteristics A knight's move consists of: - Moving 2 squares in one direction (either horizontal or vertical), - Then 1 square perpendicular to the initial direction. This move pattern means that a knight always lands on a different color square than the one it started from. Step 2: Chessboard Coloring A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid where the squares are alternately colored black and white. There are 32 black squares and 32 white squares. Step 3: Initial Color and Final Color Consistency - The knight starts at the lower-left corner, which is a black square. - With each move changing the knight's square color, after an odd number of moves, the knight will be on a square of the opposite color. - Thus, after 2009 moves, which is an odd number, the knight will be on a white square. Step 4: Reachability of Squares Since there are no additional constraints such as position parity or specific rows/columns being inaccessible by repeating the right combination of knight moves, theoretically, the knight can reach any square of the same color after the correct number of moves. Step 5: Half the Squares are Reachable After exactly 2009 legal knight’s moves, he must be on a white square. - We established there are 32 white squares on a chessboard.

By applying the spatial relationships between lines and planes, and between planes, we can identify the correct propositions. **Solution** - ① If alpha perp beta and m perp alpha, then m parallel beta is a false statement because the condition can also be satisfied when m subset beta; - ② If m perp alpha and m perp beta, then alpha parallel beta is a true statement, as two planes perpendicular to the same line are parallel; - ③ If m parallel alpha and m perp n, then n perp alpha is a false statement. This is because when m parallel alpha, there can also exist a line within plane alpha that is perpendicular to m, hence n subset alpha is also possible, making it a false statement; - ④ If m parallel alpha and m subset beta, then alpha parallel beta is a false statement, because if a line in one plane is parallel to another plane, those two planes might be parallel or they might intersect, hence it is a false statement.

Consider the equilateral triangle ABC with vertex A, and a line passing through A that does not intersect segment (BC). Let points (M) and (N) be taken on this line such that (AM = AN = AB). According to the problem, point (B) is inside the angle (MAN). 2. Notice that triangle (BAN) is isosceles with (AB = AN). Therefore, (angle BAN = angle ABN). 3. Also, triangle (MAC) is another isosceles triangle with (AM = AC). Hence, (angle MAC = angle AMC). 4. Since (AB = AC) and angle (angle BAC = 60^circ) (because (ABC) is an equilateral triangle), we have that: [ angle BAN = frac{1}{2} angle BAC = frac{60^circ}{2} = 30^circ ] 5. Similarly, [ angle CAM = frac{1}{2} angle CAB = frac{60^circ}{2} = 30^circ ] 6. So, (angle BAC = angle BAN + angle CAM = 30^circ + 30^circ = 60^circ). 7. Next, consider (angle BN). By the exterior angle theorem in triangle (BAN), we know: [ angle ANB = 180^circ - (angle BAN + angle ABN) = 180^circ - (30^circ + 30^circ) = 120^circ ] 8.

We can write: [ 81 = 7^2 + 2 cdot 4^2 ] Here, ( x = 7 ) and ( y = 4 ). Notice that: - ( x = 7 ) is odd. - ( y = 4 ) is even. - ( gcd(7, 4) = 1 ). 2. **Prime Factorization**: - ( x^2 = 49 ) has an even number of prime factors (since ( 49 = 7^2 )). - ( 2y^2 = 2 cdot 16 = 32 ) has an odd number of prime factors (since ( 32 = 2^5 )). 3. **Constructing Larger Good Numbers**: Using Lagrange's identity for sums of squares: [ (a^2 + mb^2)(c^2 + md^2) = (ac - mbd)^2 + m(bc + ad)^2 ] Set ( m = 2 ), ( c = a ), and ( d = b ): [ (a^2 + 2b^2)^2 = (a^2 - 2b^2)^2 + 2(2ab)^2 ] Assume ( a^2 + 2b^2 = n_1^4 ), where ( n_1 ) is the largest known number of the form ( a^4 ) that is good. Then: [ n_1^8 = (a^2 - 2b^2)^2 + 2(2ab)^2 ] Here, ( a^2 - 2b^2 ) and ( 2ab ) are coprime. 4. **Inductive Step**: Starting from ( 3^4 = 81 ), we can construct: [ 9^4 = (7^2 - 2 cdot 4^2)^2 + 2(2 cdot 7 cdot 4)^2 = 1^2 + 2 cdot 56^2 ] Similarly, we can construct ( 81^4 ), and so on. 5. **Conclusion**: By repeatedly applying the construction, we can generate an infinite sequence of numbers ( n ) such that ( n^4 ) is a good number.

To find the length of the longer train, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to m/s by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 hour): Relative speed in m/s = 6 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) = (6 * 1000) / 3600 = 6000 / 3600 = 1.6667 m/s The trains take 210 seconds to cross each other. During this time, they cover a distance equal to the sum of their lengths. Let's denote the length of the longer train as L meters.

However, this angle is not necessarily one of the triangle's internal angles, meaning that while the condition for the dot product being less than zero can be met, it does not guarantee that triangle ABC must be obtuse.

He gave rides to three groups, earning an additional 5 for each ride, so: 3 rides * 5/ride = 15 Now, let's calculate the total amount he spent on gas and will be reimbursed for. He put 17 gallons of gas in the limo at 3 per gallon, so: 17 gallons * 3/gallon = 51 Adding the hourly wage, the amount from the rides, and the gas reimbursement gives us: 120 (hourly wage) + 15 (rides) + 51 (gas) = 186 Hayden was owed 226 for his work today, and we've accounted for 186 of that.

The segment (BK) intersects side (CD) at point (L), and the ray (OL) intersects the circle again at point (M). We need to prove that (KM) is the angle bisector of (angle BKC). 1. **Triangle Properties:** Since (OA = OB = OK) and (angle BOA = 90^circ), the triangles (ABO) and (BOK) are right isosceles triangles. Hence, we have: [ angle BAK = angle BKA = 45^circ ] 2. **Parallelogram Properties:** Using the properties of the parallelogram, we know that (angle KBC = angle CDK = 45^circ). Thus, quadrilateral (BCKD) is cyclic (inscribed in a circle).

Since (angle BOD = 90^circ), quadrilateral (BLDO) is cyclic as well. Consequently: [ angle BDC = angle BOM ] 4. **Inscribed Angle:** Notice that (angle BOM) is the central angle subtended by arc (BM), while (angle BKM) is the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.

Then: operatorname{tg} alpha = frac{8}{15} and: operatorname{tg} beta = 4 2. **Use the tangent double-angle formula:** Write the formula for operatorname{tg} 2beta: operatorname{tg} 2beta = frac{2 operatorname{tg} beta}{1 - operatorname{tg}^2 beta} Substitute operatorname{tg} beta = 4: operatorname{tg} 2beta = frac{2 cdot 4}{1 - 4^2} = frac{8}{1 - 16} = frac{8}{-15} = -frac{8}{15} = -operatorname{tg} alpha 3. **Relate it to the original problem:** Since -operatorname{tg} alpha = operatorname{tg}(pi - alpha) and knowing the interval (0 < alpha, beta < frac{pi}{2}): 2beta = pi - alpha Rightarrow 2 cdot operatorname{arctg} 4 = pi - operatorname{arctg} frac{8}{15} 4. **Substitute in the given expression:** We see that: 2 cdot operatorname{arctg} 4 = pi - operatorname{arctg} frac{8}{15} So: frac{pi - operatorname{arctg} frac{8}{15}}{pi - operatorname{arctg} frac{8}{15}} = 1 # Conclusion: The value of the given expression is boxed{1}."},{"prompt":"A right cylinder with a base radius of 4 units is inscribed in a sphere of radius 7 units.

So, Gibi scored boxed{59} percent in the exam."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},M={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],I={key:0},W={key:1};function E(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",M,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
