The largest possible value for k is when Ostap Bender was just above the candidate who gets eliminated in the first round, meaning Ostap Bender could have been second to last. 3. **Maximum k Calculation**: - In the worst-case scenario, Ostap Bender can be positioned such that he almost always advances but barely avoids elimination. - Over the rounds, Ostap Bender improves his standing by gathering the votes from eliminated candidates one by one. To determine this maximum possible k, consider he needs to stay-in even until the 1002nd round happens. - To simplify, assume all 2002 candidates tied almost equally: If (k = 2001), this means Ostap would be the second-to-last candidate, but since Ostap wins, he must have survived every round with the minimum number of votes to avoid elimination. 4. **Final Vote Distribution**: - To calculate the number of votes, if each candidate initially gets votes in an almost equal distribution of 10^6, 10^6 + 1, ldots 10^6 + 2001, - When it comes to half the rounds, it means Ostap has outlasted 1001 candidates, collecting their votes one by one.

Therefore, the large cube can be described as having dimensions 3 times 3 times 3. 2. **Surface Area Calculation**: For a cube of side length (a), the surface area (A) is given by: [ A = 6a^2 ] When (a = 3), the surface area of the large cube is: [ A = 6 times 3^2 = 6 times 9 = 54 ] 3. **Removing a Smaller Cube**: If we remove a smaller cube from the large cube in such a way that the surface area of the remaining structure stays the same, we must ensure that for every external face removed, there is a corresponding internal face that becomes external. Consider removing a (2 times 2 times 2) cube (which contains (2^3 = 8 ) unit cubes) from one corner. Each side of this (2 times 2 times 2) cube has an external face of (2 times 2). By removing an external face, a corresponding internal (2 times 2) face becomes external. 4. **Surface Area After First Removal**: Initially, the large (3 times 3 times 3) cube has six faces, each with an area of (3 times 3 = 9). Removing the (2 times 2 times 2) cube from one corner: - Original 3 external faces are removed (each (2^2 = 4)). - These are replaced by the new (2 times 2) internal faces of the smaller cube. The net change in the surface area: - External surface area lost: (3 times 4 = 12) - Internal surface area exposed: (3 times 4 = 12) Hence, the surface area remains unchanged. 4. **Removing Additional Unit Cubes**: After removing (8) unit cubes, we are left with (19) cubes. We now need to remove (2) more cubes. - These can be removed as a (1 times 1 times 2) column from another corner of the remaining structure. - Similarly, ensure the removal replaces the external faces exactly with internal ones, keeping the total surface area unaffected.

Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). - **When m > 0:** The condition f'(x) > 0 gives us 0 < x < frac{1}{m}. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{m}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{m}, +infty). In summary: - For m leq 0, f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). - For m > 0, f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{m}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{m}, +infty). Part (2): Minimum Value of a+2b When m=e Given f(x) = ln x - ex, the slope of the tangent line at point (x_0, ln x_0 - ex_0) is: k = f'(x_0) = frac{1}{x_0} - e. The equation of the tangent line is: y - (ln x_0 - ex_0) = left(frac{1}{x_0} - eright)(x - x_0), which simplifies to: y = left(frac{1}{x_0} - eright)x + ln x_0 - 1. Therefore, a = frac{1}{x_0} - e and b = ln x_0 - e, leading to: a+2b = frac{1}{x_0} + 2ln x_0 - e - 2. Let g(x_0) = frac{1}{x_0} + 2ln x_0 - e - 2, and find its derivative: g'(x_0) = -frac{1}{x_0^2} + frac{2}{x_0} = frac{2x_0 - 1}{x_0^2}. - For g'(x_0) < 0, we have 0 < x_0 < frac{1}{2}, and g(x_0) is decreasing. - For g'(x_0) > 0, we have x_0 > frac{1}{2}, and g(x_0) is increasing. Thus, the minimum value of g(x_0), and hence a+2b, occurs at x_0 = frac{1}{2}: gleft(frac{1}{2}right) = -e - 2ln 2. Therefore, the minimum value of a+2b is boxed{-e - 2ln 2}. Part (3): Proving 2x_1 + x_2 > frac{e}{2} Given f(x) = ln x - mx = (2-m)x + n, we have ln x - 2x = n. Let F(x) = ln x - 2x, then: F'(x) = frac{1 - 2x}{x}. - For F'(x) > 0, we have 0 < x < frac{1}{2}, and F(x) is increasing. - For F'(x) < 0, we have x > frac{1}{2}, and F(x) is decreasing. Since F(1) = -2, we conclude n < -2. Let 0 < x_1 < frac{1}{2} < x_2, then: ln frac{x_1}{x_2} = 2(x_1 - x_2). Letting frac{x_1}{x_2} = t, we find x_2 = frac{ln t}{2(t-1)} and x_1 = frac{tln t}{2(t-1)}, where 0 < t < 1. To prove 2x_1 + x_2 > frac{e}{2}, we show: frac{2tln t}{t-1} + frac{ln t}{t-1} > e, which simplifies to: left(2t+1right)ln t < eleft(t-1right). Let h(t) = left(2t+1right)ln t - eleft(t-1right), and find its derivative: h'(t) = frac{1}{t} + 2ln t - e + 2. Analyzing h'(t), we find that h(t) has a critical point in (frac{1}{sqrt{e}}, 1). Since h(frac{1}{e}) < 0 and h(1) = 0, we conclude h(t) < 0 for all 0 < t < 1.

The tangents at A and B are parallel. We are to find the area enclosed by the two curves between x_2 = sqrt{2} and x_1 < 0. 2. **Equation of the Circle:** Since the tangents at A and B are parallel, AB is the diameter of the circle, and its midpoint, which is the origin (0,0), is the circle's center.

In this setup, every line containing a side of the polygon intersects l at a distinct point different from P. 2. **Marking the Vertices**: For any vertex of the polygon, the lines containing the sides emerging from that vertex intersect the line l on different sides of point P. Let's formalize this: - Suppose v_1, v_2, ..., v_n are the vertices of the polygon. - Let E be the set of edges of the polygon, and each edge e in E intersects the line l at a point p_e. - The coordinates on line l are aligned so that moving from negative infinity to positive infinity on l crosses through each p_e in a specific order. 3. **Counting Intersecting Segments**: - As we move along line l, each point p_e represents an intersection of an edge of the polygon with l. - For a vertex v_k, if the lines containing the sides e_1 and e_2 spanning from v_k to other vertices intersect l, they do so at distinct points p_{e_1} and p_{e_2}. - Therefore, these intersection points are counted as distinct markings on l. 4. **Even and Odd Conditions**: - When point P is examined for whether it lies inside the polygon, the condition of \\"odd number of vertices being marked on each side of l\\" becomes crucial. - To determine whether P is inside the polygon, an odd number of classified intervals (edges projecting through l) must include P. **Proof**: - If P is inside the polygon, the crossing of l by edges ensures that P is encapsulated by these crossings. This implies that as P moves along l, it intersects a new segment each time a boundary of the polygon is crossed. - Each time P crosses over a boundary segment, the parity (odd or even count) of the segment crossings changes. - When P lies outside the polygon, moving P across l changes the count to zero outside any contained segments.

By applying the described transformation to each (4 times 4) grid, we can ensure that the entire (m times n) grid will have all numbers flipped. 3. **When one dimension is not a multiple of 4:** - Assume (m) is not a multiple of 4. Without loss of generality, assume (m) is odd. - Consider the first column of the grid. Each transformation either changes the signs of exactly two cells in the first column or leaves them unchanged. Therefore, the sum of the degrees (number of changes) of all cells in the first column must be even. - If (m) is odd, the sum of the degrees being even contradicts the requirement that each cell must change an odd number of times in order to achieve an overall sign flip. Hence, it is impossible to achieve a sign flip in a grid when (m) is odd. 4. **Other cases when (m) and (n) are not multiples of 4:** - Suppose (m = 4k + 2) for some integer (k). If there are (4k + 2) rows, each transformation that affects two cells in the first column must be performed an odd number of times in order to make it possible. This again results in a contradiction according to the even sum of degrees argument. # Conclusion: - From the analysis above, it can be concluded that the sign-flipping transformation is only possible when both (m) and (n) are multiples of 4.

The transformation in the problem converts the triple ( (a_{k-1}, a_k, a_{k+1}) ) into ( (a_{k-1} + a_k, -a_k, a_{k+1} + a_k) ). This operation corresponds to swapping adjacent terms in the sequence ( {x_k} ). Specifically, it interchanges: [ x_{k+in}, x_{k+in+1} quad text{for all} ; i in mathbb{Z} ] 5. Under this transformation, examine the behavior of a finite sequence ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ). Since each adjacent pair can be swapped, we can achieve any permutation of the elements within the sequence. 6. If the interchange occurs when ( k ) is a multiple of ( n ), then relevantly, ( x_1 leftrightarrow x_n ) yielding: [ x_1 rightarrow x_n - S, quad x_n rightarrow x_1 + S ] 7. Using this swapping mechanism, we can first move the minimum value of ( {x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n} ) to the start and the maximum value to the end of the sequence: [ x_{1} leq x_{2} leq cdots leq x_{n} leq x_{1} + S ] 8. If ( x_n leq x_1 + S ) holds, we can simply sort the remaining ( n-2 ) elements in non-decreasing order. However, if ( x_n > x_1 + S ), swap ( x_1 ) and ( x_n ) to form new values: [ x_1 rightarrow x_n - S, quad x_n rightarrow x_1 + S ] and iterate until ( x_n leq x_1 + S ). 9. Iterating this process guarantees that, eventually, all resulting ( x'_1, x'_2, ldots, x'_n ) can be arranged so that: [ x'_1 leq x'_2 leq cdots leq x'_n leq x'_1 + S ] 10.

We can consider two scenarios based on which side represents the height (or the \\"lateral height\\") of the cylinder. **Case 1**: When the side length 1 is the height of the cylinder, the base radius r is found by equating the perimeter of the circle (the other side of the rectangle) to the formula for circumference, 2pi r = 4pi. Solving this, we find the radius r = 2. The volume V of the cylinder is calculated using the formula V = pi r^2 h, where h is the height: [ V = pi cdot 2^2 cdot 1 = 4pi. ] So, in this case, the volume of the cylinder is boxed{4pi}. **Case 2**: Alternatively, if we consider the side length 4pi as the height of the cylinder, then the base radius r would be found by using the other side length of the rectangle, 1, as the circumference of the base circle, 2pi r = 1.

Substituting this radius and the height into the volume formula: [ V = pi left( frac{1}{2pi} right)^2 cdot 4pi = pi cdot frac{1}{4pi^2} cdot 4pi = 1. ] Thus, in this scenario, the volume of the cylinder is boxed{1}.

We start with three points such that all pairwise distances between them are less than 1. We want to determine whether we can eventually obtain a set containing two points whose distance is greater than 1. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Configuration**: - Start with three points (A), (B), and (C) such that the distance between any two points is less than 1: [ AB < 1, quad BC < 1, quad text{and} quad AC < 1. ] 2. **Define Perpendicular Bisectors**: - For any two points (X) and (Y), the perpendicular bisector is the line that equally divides the segment (XY). Mathematically, if (X = (x_1, y_1)) and (Y = (x_2, y_2)), the midpoint (M) of (XY) is: [ M = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right), ] and the slope of the line (XY) is (frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}). The slope of the perpendicular bisector is (-frac{x_2 - x_1}{y_2 - y_1}). 3. **Generating Symmetric Points**: - For each pair of points, we can add a symmetric point concerning their perpendicular bisector. Let’s generate these symmetric points iteratively. 4. **Check Distances**: - Each time a point is added, we need to check the distances from the new point to all other points. Due to the symmetry property, distances transform predictably. 5. **Possible Divergence**: - By iteratively adding symmetric points, the distances between some pairs of points could potentially grow. Checking these hypothetically generated points and their subsequent distances can show divergence. 6. **Example Construction**: - Start with points (A = (0, 0)), (B = (0.5, 0)), and (C = (0.25, 0.5)). Their pairwise distances are: [ AB = 0.5, quad BC approx 0.559, quad AC approx 0.559. ] - Generate point (D) symmetric to (B) about perpendicular bisector of (AC), and so on. 7. **Conclusion**: - Continue the process of generating symmetric points. With each step, some of the newly added points can diverge further away, eventually leading to distances that may exceed 1. Thus, it is shown that by beginning with three points where all pairwise distances are less than 1, we can generate new points such that the set eventually contains two points with a distance greater than 1.

Subtracting these two equations, we obtain a_{n+1}=2a_n+1. This can be rearranged to a_{n+1}+1=2(a_n+1) (for ngeqslant 2). Since a_1=0, we have a_1+1=1, a_2=a_1+1=1, and a_2+1=2(a_1+1). Therefore, the sequence {a_n+1} is a geometric sequence with the first term 1 and common ratio 2. (Ⅱ) From (Ⅰ), we have a_n=2^{n-1}-1. Since the point (T_{n+1},T_n) lies on the line frac{x}{n+1}-frac{y}{n}=frac{1}{2}, we have frac{T_{n+1}}{n+1}-frac{T_n}{n}=frac{1}{2}. Therefore, {frac{T_n}{n}} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term frac{T_1}{1}=1 and common difference frac{1}{2}. Thus, frac{T_n}{n}=1+frac{1}{2}(n-1), and hence T_n=frac{n(n+1)}{2}. For ngeqslant 2, b_n=T_n-T_{n-1}=frac{n(n+1)}{2}-frac{n(n-1)}{2}=n. Since b_1=1 satisfies this equation, we have b_n=n.

Solving the quadratic equation:** Using the quadratic formula ( k = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) where (a = 2), (b = -5), (c = 2): [ k = frac{5 pm sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 times 2 times 2}}{4} = frac{5 pm sqrt{25 - 16}}{4} = frac{5 pm 3}{4} ] Thus, [ k = frac{8}{4} = 2 ] [ k = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2} ] **Step 7. Roots of the polynomial:** Given (x = frac{1}{k}), if (k = 2), then: [ x = frac{1}{2}, kx = 1, k^2x = 2 ] If (k = frac{1}{2}), then: [ x = 2, kx = 1, k^2x = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, the roots are (1, 2, frac{1}{2}). **Step 8.

We have two situations described: 1. **Daytime Situation:** - Two packets of cookies are opened. - The total number of cookies is ( 2m ). - These cookies are distributed equally among ( n ) tourists. - One extra cookie remains. Therefore, the equation for this situation is: [ 2m equiv 1 pmod{n} ] 2. **Evening Situation:** - Three packets of cookies are opened. - The total number of cookies is ( 3m ). - These cookies are distributed equally among ( n ) tourists. - Thirteen extra cookies remain. Therefore, the equation for this situation is: [ 3m equiv 13 pmod{n} ] To solve these simultaneous congruences, we note that ( m ) must satisfy both conditions: 1.

Subtract the first condition from the second: [ 3m - 2m = (ln + 13) - (kn + 1) ] [ m = (l - k)n + 12 ] Thus, the number of tourists ( n ) must be a divisor of 12. However, we already know that ( n > 13 ). Considering that 23 is the next natural number greater than 13 and solving for ( n = 23 ), we examine: 1.

Completing the square gives us f(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1. Since (x-1)^2 geq 0 for all x, the minimum value of f(x) is 1 when x=1. Therefore, for x geq 0, f(x) in [1, +infty). 2. **For x < 0 and a=0:** The function simplifies to f(x) = x, which is a linear function with no transformation. Thus, as x approaches 0 from the left, f(x) covers the interval (-infty, 0). However, combining this with the interval from step 1, we see that (-infty, 0) cup [1, +infty) neq R, indicating that a=0 does not satisfy the condition for the function's range to be R. 3. **For x < 0 and a > 0:** The function becomes f(x) = x + frac{a}{x} + 3a. Analyzing the monotonicity, we find that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, -sqrt{a}) and monotonically decreasing on (-sqrt{a}, 0). The maximum value of f(x) in this domain occurs at x = -sqrt{a}, yielding f(-sqrt{a}) = 3a - 2sqrt{a}. Therefore, f(x) in (-infty, 3a - 2sqrt{a}]. To ensure the function's range is R, we need 3a - 2sqrt{a} geq 1. Solving this inequality gives a geq 1. 4. **For x < 0 and a < 0:** Given that both y=x and y=frac{a}{x} are monotonically increasing on (-infty, 0), the function f(x) = x + frac{a}{x} + 3a is also monotonically increasing in this interval. As x approaches 0, f(x) approaches +infty, and as x approaches -infty, f(x) approaches -infty. Thus, in this case, f(x) in (-infty, +infty), which satisfies the condition for the function's range to be R. **In summary**, combining the conditions from steps 1 to 4, the range of a for which the function's range is R is boxed{(-infty, 0) cup [1, +infty)}."},{"prompt":"a band of 101 terrorists, all members have never participated in a raid together, and each pair of terrorists has met exactly once in a raid.

Downstream: The speed of the boat in still water is 12 kmph, and the water current adds another 2 kmph, so the downstream speed is: 12 kmph + 2 kmph = 14 kmph Upstream: For the first third of the journey, the water current is 4 kmph, so the upstream speed is: 12 kmph - 4 kmph = 8 kmph For the second third of the journey, the water current is 2 kmph, so the upstream speed is: 12 kmph - 2 kmph = 10 kmph For the final third of the journey, the water current is 3 kmph, so the upstream speed is: 12 kmph - 3 kmph = 9 kmph Now, let's calculate the time taken to cover each third of the journey upstream. The total distance upstream is the same as downstream, which is 42 km. Each third of the journey is: 42 km / 3 = 14 km Time taken for the first third at 8 kmph: Time = Distance / Speed = 14 km / 8 kmph = 1.75 hours Time taken for the second third at 10 kmph: Time = Distance / Speed = 14 km / 10 kmph = 1.4 hours Time taken for the final third at 9 kmph: Time = Distance / Speed = 14 km / 9 kmph = 1.5556 hours Now, let's add the times for each third of the journey: Total time upstream without stops = 1.75 hours + 1.4 hours + 1.5556 hours Total time upstream without stops = 4.7056 hours The boat makes 2 stops of 15 minutes each during the journey. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each stop is: 15 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.25 hours The total time for the stops is: 2 stops * 0.25 hours/stop = 0.5 hours Finally, let's add the time for the stops to the total time upstream without stops: Total time upstream with stops = 4.7056 hours + 0.5 hours Total time upstream with stops = 5.2056 hours Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{5.2056} hours for the boat to cover the same distance upstream, including the stops."},{"prompt":"Find the greatest common divisor of 867 and 2553.","completion":"We will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of the two numbers.

Initial Setup: - Black Box: 8 bananas, 10 mangoes. - White Box: 0 bananas, 12 mangoes. Steps: 1. **Equality Condition**: Both boxes should eventually contain an equal number of bananas and mangoes. 2. **Decision Point**: Any action involves Jenya either eating the fruit or moving it to the other box.

A: ②③④ B: ①③④ C: ①②④ D: ①②③","completion":"To solve this problem, we'll break down the given information and the steps to reach the conclusions systematically: 1. **Given Equations and Symmetry**: - We are given that g(x) = 2f(x+1) - 2. This can be rewritten for x-1 as g(x-1) = 2f(x) - 2. - Additionally, we have 2f(x) + g(x-3) = 2. Substituting g(x-1) = 2f(x) - 2 into this equation, we get g(x-1) + g(x-3) = 0. 2. **Periodicity of g(x)**: - From g(x-1) + g(x-3) = 0, we can deduce that g(x+2) = -g(x). This implies that g(x+4) = g(x), indicating that 4 is the period of g(x). 3. **Symmetry of g(x)**: - Since the graph of y = f(x) is symmetric about the line x = 1, and given the transformation for g(x), the graph of g(x) will be symmetric about the line x = 0. However, with g(x+4) = g(x), we can further deduce that the graph of g(x) is symmetric about the line x = 2. 4. **Calculating Specific Values**: - Given f(1) = 3, we substitute into g(x) = 2f(x+1) - 2 to find g(0). Thus, g(0) = 2f(1) - 2 = 2cdot3 - 2 = 4. - Since g(x+2) = -g(x), and we have established the symmetry and periodicity of g(x), we can deduce that g(3) = 0 by considering the symmetry about x = 2 and the value of g(0). 5. **Conclusion**: - Based on the deductions and calculations, we conclude that ① g(0) = 4, ② 4 is the period of g(x), and ④ g(3) = 0 are correct. The graph of g(x) being symmetric about the point (2,0) is not directly concluded from the given information, but the symmetry about the line x = 2 is established, which might have been a confusion point.

An edge ((u, v) in U times V) exists if the column ( u ) does not contain the number ( v ). 2. **Degree of Vertices:** Each column in the ((n-2) times n) array contains ( n-2 ) numbers, so there are ( 2 ) numbers missing from each column. Therefore, each vertex in ( U ) has degree ( 2 ). 3. **Neighbors in ( V ):** For any subset ( X subseteq U ) of cardinality ( k ), there are exactly ( 2k ) edges coming out of this set because each column (vertex in ( U )) has degree ( 2 ). 4. **Application of Hall's Theorem:** Hall's Marriage Theorem states that a bipartite graph ( G = (U, V, E) ) has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset ( X subseteq U ), the number of neighbors of ( X ) in ( V ) (denoted ( N(X) )) is at least ( |X| ).

Given the sum of angles angle ABD + angle DBC + angle CBA = 180^circ and angle ADB + angle BDC + angle CDA = 180^circ. 4. Moreover, angle ACB + angle ACD + angle BCD = 90^circ. Now, we need to find the volume of tetrahedron ABCD. Step-by-step solution: 1. Unfold the tetrahedron ABCD on the plane BCD to form a plane triangle representation involving points A_1, A_2, A_3 which are projections of point A through points B and D. 2. From angle ABD + angle DBC + angle CBA = 180^circ, it can be deduced that points A_1, B, and A_2 are collinear. Similarly, A_1, D, and A_3 are also collinear. These ensure that angle A_{2} C A_{3} = 90^circ. 3. Since AB = AD, use points A_1, A_2, A_3 such that A_1A_2 = A_1A_3. B and D are the midpoints of A_1A_2 and A_1A_3 respectively, hence A_2C = A_3C. Knowing that 2BD = A_2A_3 = sqrt{2}, let d represent the distance from A_1 to A_2A_3, i.e., A_1 to the line A_2A_3 be 2a. 4. The total surface area of the tetrahedron S can be calculated as: [ S = S_{triangle A_1A_2A_3} + S_{triangle CA_2A_3} = sqrt{2}a + frac{1}{2} = 1 ] 5. Solving sqrt{2}a + frac{1}{2} = 1, we get: [ sqrt{2}a = 1 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} ] [ a = frac{frac{1}{2}}{sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{2} * frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} ] 6. From this resolved variable (a), it follows that AC = A_2C = 1 and AB = AD = frac{1}{2}. 7. With the right angles angle BA_1D = angle BA_2C = angle DA_3C = 90^circ, it is clear that AC perp text{plane } ABD. So, the volume of tetrahedron V_{ABCD} is: [ V = frac{1}{3} AC cdot S_{triangle ABD} ] 8. Given S_{triangle ABD} = frac{1}{2} AB cdot BD = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{8}, hence: [ V = frac{1}{3} cdot 1 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{8} = frac{sqrt{2}}{24} ] Thus, the volume of the tetrahedron ABCD is boxed{frac{1}{24}}."},{"prompt":"After seven judges each score a diver, the highest and lowest scores are removed.

Let's assign colors (c_3, c_4, ldots, c_{4n-1}) to the chords, where a chord is colored (c_i) if the sum of the numbers at its endpoints is (i). 2. **Construct Graph (G_c)**: For each color (c), we construct a graph (G_c) with vertices representing the chords of color (c). Two vertices are connected by an edge if their corresponding chords are not disjoint (i.e., they share an endpoint). 3. **Objective**: We aim to show that there exists a color (c) such that the graph (G_c) has an independent set of at least 100 vertices.

Ali then sold some of these seashells and had 55 left. To find out how many he sold, we subtract the number he had left from the number he had before selling: 110 (seashells before selling) - 55 (seashells left) = 55 seashells sold.

Since each boy chooses a target independently and uniformly at random, the probability that a specific boy does not hit target i is 1 - frac{1}{n}. 3. Therefore, the probability that none of the n boys hit target i is left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^n. 4.

Prove that it is possible to pierce through both maps with a needle in such a way that the puncture point on both maps represents the same point in the area. **Steps:** 1. Let the original map be represented as a rectangle K_0 lying on a plane, and the smaller map be represented as a rectangle K_1 which is contained within K_0. 2. Consider the similarity transformation f, specifically a homothety (similarity transformation including rotation), that maps the rectangle K_0 onto the rectangle K_1. This transformation f represents scaling down the map from K_0 to K_1. 3. Let K_i represent a sequence of rectangles where K_{i+1} = f(K_i), meaning that each subsequent rectangle is a scaled-down version of the previous one using the transformation f. Next, let's understand the behavior of the sequence of rectangles K_i: 1. Since f is a similarity transformation that continuously scales down the map, the sequence K_i forms a nested sequence of rectangles, each one contained within the previous. 2. By properties of nested sequences of compact sets in the Euclidean plane, there exists a unique point X such that X belongs to all rectangles in the sequence K_i. 3. The existence of the point X is given by the nested set theorem, which states that for a decreasing sequence of nested non-empty compact sets, their intersection is non-empty and compact. 4. We must show that this point X is the point we are looking for in both maps. Specifically, if f(X) = X, point X remains fixed under the transformation f. **Conclusion:** Since X is contained in every K_i and f(X) in K_{i+1}, the unique point X that is invariant under the transformation f satisfies the condition f(X) = X. Hence, there is a common point that represents the same physical location on both maps.

For operatorname{lcm}[12,2], since 12 is divisible by 2, the LCM is simply the larger number, 12. Therefore, operatorname{lcm}[12,2] = 12. 2. Similarly, for operatorname{lcm}[12,4], since 12 is divisible by 4, the LCM is 12. Thus, operatorname{lcm}[12,4] = 12. 3. For operatorname{lcm}[12,6], as 12 is divisible by 6, the LCM remains 12. Hence, operatorname{lcm}[12,6] = 12. 4. When considering operatorname{lcm}[12,12], since both numbers are the same, the LCM is the number itself, 12. So, operatorname{lcm}[12,12] = 12. 5. Moving to operatorname{lcm}[12,8], we note that 12 is 2^2cdot 3 and 8 is 2^3. The LCM must include the highest power of each prime factor present in either number, which gives us 2^3cdot 3 = 24. Therefore, operatorname{lcm}[12,8] = 24. 6. Lastly, for operatorname{lcm}[12,10], considering 12 is 2^2cdot 3 and 10 introduces a new prime factor, 5, the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved: 2^2cdot 3 cdot 5 = 60.

According to the given information: The length of AB can be calculated using the distance formula: |AB| = sqrt{(3 - (-1))^2 + (2 - 5)^2} = sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2} = 5. Since the area of triangle ABC is the product of half the base and height, and it's given to be 10: S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} |AB| cdot d = frac{1}{2} cdot 5 cdot d = 10. Solving for d, we find: d = frac{2 cdot 10}{5} = 4. Next, we need the equation of the line AB. The slope formula for a line passing through two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is: frac{y - y_1}{y_2 - y_1} = frac{x - x_1}{x_2 - x_1}.

Since point C is on the line 3x - y + 3 = 0, let's denote the coordinates of C as (x_0, 3x_0 + 3).

Given that there are nine nonnegative numbers, with an average of 10, the sum of these numbers can be calculated as follows: [ text{Sum} = text{Average} times text{Number of numbers} = 10 times 9 = 90 ] 2. We need to determine the greatest possible value for the median of these nine numbers. Recall that when arranging nine numbers in non-decreasing order, the median is the fifth number in this sequence. 3. Let the desired median be ( m ). By definition, the median is the middle number when the numbers are sorted, so at least five of the numbers must be at least ( m ). 4. Assume that the five highest numbers are all at least ( m ). Let us investigate the extreme scenario where the first four numbers are small as possible (specifically zero) to maximize ( m ). Therefore, these four numbers can be written as: [ x_1 = 0, quad x_2 = 0, quad x_3 = 0, quad x_4 = 0 ] 5. The sum of these four numbers is: [ 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ] 6. The remaining five numbers will then need to sum to a total of 90 because the sum of all nine numbers must be 90: [ x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 + x_9 = 90 ] 7.

Given that the smallest sum that can be obtained is 5, we can deduce that the smallest two numbers among the four positive integers cannot include 1, because if 1 were included, a sum of 4 or less could be possible with another small integer.

However, to ensure that all sums (5, 6, 7, 8) can be obtained with only four numbers, the largest number cannot exceed 5 because we need to use the smallest numbers (2 and 3) to obtain the smaller sums.

We need to show that if we draw a line e through any position of M such that e is perpendicular to the angle bisector of angle F_1MF_2, then all other positions of M will lie on the same side of e as F_1. Let's go step by step: 1. **Reflection and Perpendicular Bisector**: - Let F_1' be the reflection of F_1 across the line e. Therefore, e is the perpendicular bisector of F_1F_1', and for any point P on the plane that lies on the same side of e as F_1, we have PF_1' > PF_1, while for others PF_1' leq PF_1.

Additionally, [ F_1'F_2 = F_1'M + MF_2 = F_1M + MF_2 = s. ] 3. **Collinear Case**: - When M is on the line F_1F_2 itself (degenerate triangle case): Since s > F_1F_2, M must lie such that F_1 and F_2 are on the same side of M. Therefore, angle F_1MF_2 = 0^{circ}, making e perp F_1F_2. Consequently, F_1' lies on the line MF_1, with M separating F_1' from F_2, giving us the property: [ F_1'F_2 = F_1'M + MF_2. ] 4. **Contradiction Proof**: - Suppose contrary to the claim, there exists another position M^* of the moving point M on e, or on the opposite side of e from F_1.

Then N G_1' = N G_1 = N G_2 - d. Thus, G_1'G_2 = d. 2. **Contradiction Proof**: - Assuming another position N^* existing on g or its opposite side from G_1, then: [ N^* G_1' leq N^* G_1 quad text{and} quad N^*G_2 - N^*G_1 = d. ] - Therefore, [ begin{aligned} d^* = N^*G_2 - N^* G_1' geq d. end{aligned} ] 3. **Triangle Inequality**: - Applying the triangle inequality to N^*, G_1', G_2, [ begin{aligned} d^* &= N^* G_2 - N^* G_1' leq G_1' G_2 = d, end{aligned} ] resulting in d^* = d. 4. **Conclusion**: - Equality requires N^* to be on g, lying on G_1'G_2.

Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between ( A ) and one of its subsets (elements in the power set), by definition, the cardinality of ( A ) is less than or equal to the cardinality of the power set ( mathscr{A} ).

Given that the total amount of benzene required is 156, we can assume that this is the molar mass of benzene. The molar mass of benzene (C6H6) is approximately 78 g/mol. Therefore, if 156 g of benzene is required, we can calculate the number of moles of benzene as follows: Number of moles of benzene = mass of benzene / molar mass of benzene Number of moles of benzene = 156 g / 78 g/mol Number of moles of benzene = 2 moles Since 2 moles of benzene are required to produce 2 moles of toluene, and the reaction is a 1:1 ratio between benzene and methane, we will also need 2 moles of methane to react with the 2 moles of benzene.

To determine the value of m + n, follow the steps below: 1. **Calculate the length of the altitude:** - Since triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the altitude from A to BC bisects BC. Let D be the midpoint of BC. Thus, BD = DC = frac{BC}{2} = frac{6}{2} = 3. - Let AD be the altitude from A to BC.

We need to determine the coordinates of H. The orthocenter of triangle ABC in this case lies on the altitude AD. When AD is drawn, A, D, H are collinear. Since AB = AC = 5 and BC = 6, by symmetry and properties of isosceles triangles, H lies such that H is the orthocenter. 3. **Finding m and n:** - The definition of orthocenter H and the given satisfaction overrightarrow{AH} = m overrightarrow{AB} + n overrightarrow{BC} helps to form the equation overrightarrow{AH} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = 0 since theta between the altitude and the base BC is 90^circ. - From the geometric properties and exact location of H, By auxiliary line let H E parallel BC and intersects AB at E, thus triangle remain congruent triangle ADE: [ H D = BD tan angle DBH = BD cot angle ACB = 3 times frac{3}{4} = frac{9}{4}. ] 4. **Calculating the weights m and n :** - Given the position of H calculated using properties of similar triangles, we get: [ m = frac{AE}{AB} = frac{AH}{AD} = frac{7}{16}. ] Similarly, for BE given in terms EH , [ n = frac{EH}{BC} = frac{EH}{2BD} = frac{7}{32}. ] 5. **Summing m and n :** [ m + n = frac{7}{16} + frac{7}{32} = frac{14}{32} + frac{7}{32} = frac{21}{32}. ] **Conclusion:** The sum m+n is given by [ boxed{frac{21}{32}}. ]"},{"prompt":"Compute 12^{1} pmod{1009}.

Then, the number of workers processing part P is frac{6000}{5x} = frac{1200}{x}, and the number of workers processing part Q is frac{2000}{3x}.

She started with 90 and ended with 12, so she spent: 90 - 12 = 78 Now, let's find out how much she spent on the sandwich and the book. She spent 1/5 of her money on a sandwich, so: 1/5 of 90 = 90 / 5 = 18 She spent 1/2 of her money on a book, so: 1/2 of 90 = 90 / 2 = 45 Now, let's add the amount she spent on the sandwich and the book: 18 (sandwich) + 45 (book) = 63 Now we know she spent 63 on the sandwich and the book together. Since she spent a total of 78, we can find out how much she spent on the museum ticket by subtracting the 63 from the 78: 78 (total spent) - 63 (sandwich and book) = 15 So, Jennifer spent 15 on the museum ticket. To find out what fraction of her total money this represents, we divide the amount spent on the museum ticket by the total amount of money she had: 15 (museum ticket) / 90 (total money) = 1/6 Therefore, Jennifer spent boxed{1/6} of her money on the museum ticket."},{"prompt":"f real numbers a and b satisfy a^{2}+a1=0 and b^{2}+b1=0, then frac{a}{b}+frac{b}{a}=____.","completion":"Given that real numbers a and b satisfy a^{2}+a-1=0 and b^{2}+b-1=0, we are tasked with finding the value of frac{a}{b}+frac{b}{a}. **Step 1: Analyze the Equations** Both a and b satisfy the same quadratic equation, x^{2}+x-1=0.

The croaking is primarily a mating call to attract female frogs. Male frogs have a vocal sac that they use to produce these croaking sounds loudly and persistently; female frogs typically don't croak or their croaks are very quiet. 4. **Conclusion:** Based on the understanding that male frogs primarily are the ones that croak to attract female counterparts and given that frog’s voices referred to here are in a field context during the harvest, it is correct to conclude that the “蛙声” (frog sound) here primarily refers to the croaking of male frogs. boxed{text{A}}."},{"prompt":"Let (a) and (b) be positive real numbers such that (2a + 3b = 1.)

Prove that this statement holds for every vertex of the tetrahedron.","completion":"I. Method 1. **Demonstrate that all edges of the tetrahedron are perpendicular to their opposite edges:** Let's consider the tetrahedron ABCD. We need to prove for this case that every edge pair connecting the vertices is perpendicular to the opposite edge. To start, consider the edge pairs DA and BC. This suffices because vertex D connects these edge pairs to the opposite face ABC. Let D_1 be the orthogonal projection of D onto the face ABC, which is also the orthocenter of the triangle ABC. Because AD_1 is a height, it must be perpendicular to BC. Similarly, since DD_1 is perpendicular to the plane ABC, it must be perpendicular to every line in this plane, including BC. Therefore, the plane determined by the lines DD_1 A is perpendicular to BC, hence DA is also perpendicular to BC just as we claimed (see Figure 1). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_667dd22427feca4bcc7eg-1.jpg?height=368&width=480&top_left_y=518&top_left_x=801) **Figure 1:** If the projection D_1 coincides with vertex A (meaning that triangle ABC has a right angle at A), we encounter a special case. Under these circumstances, D, D_1, and A do not determine a unique plane (see Figure 2). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_667dd22427feca4bcc7eg-1.jpg?height=347&width=325&top_left_y=1106&top_left_x=889) **Figure 2:** In this case, it is clear from simple reasoning: if vertex D_1 does coincide with vertex A, then the edge DA itself is perpendicular to the plane ABC, hence perpendicular to edge BC. 2. **Extend the proven edge relationship to another vertex:** We've shown the hypothesis holds for edges DA and BC. Now consider vertex A, with projection A_1 on face BCD. According to our previous argument, AA_1 is perpendicular to BC. Given that AD is perpendicular to BC, plane AA_1D is also perpendicular to BC, and hence DA_1 is perpendicular too. Therefore, A_1 must lie on the height from D to BC, making A_1 the orthocenter of BCD. Similarly, if instead of D we consider vertex B, edge pairs such as AB and CD are perpendicular as BC is the height from D, reinforcing that A_1 aligns with BC height, signifying A_1 is the orthocenter of BCD (see Figure 3). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_667dd22427feca4bcc7eg-1.jpg?height=263&width=460&top_left_y=1912&top_left_x=819) **Figure 3:** In scenarios where the previously described reasoning involves undefined planes or lines (for instance if A_1 coincides with D in Figure 3), the alternative approach in our proof remains effective (because vertex A cannot simultaneously coincide with D and B). Thus, if CD perp BA_1, i.e., CD perp BD, then triangle BCD is a right triangle, and D is also the orthocenter. 3. **Summary of orthocentric tetrahedron property:** When any vertex projects orthogonally onto the opposite face and corresponds to the orthocenter, the tetrahedron's three pairs of opposite edges are mutually perpendicular, confirming that all four heights of the tetrahedron intersect in a single point. This makes the tetrahedron orthocentric (or possessing an orthocenter). II. Method 1. **Prove a supplementary theorem:** We will prove the following auxiliary statement: In tetrahedron ABCD, vertex D projects orthogonally onto face ABC at point D_1 if and only if line AB perp CD. a. If AB perp CD, then plane S determined by lines CD and height m_c (perpendicular from C to AB) orthogonal to AB: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_667dd22427feca4bcc7eg-2.jpg?height=357&width=439&top_left_y=388&top_left_x=824) **Figure 4:** Since CD and m_c are distinct and line m_c lies in plane ABC, while CD does not, the plane S is determined by CD and m_c. Therefore, plane S perpendicular to AB at all intersections implies projection D^* along m_c fulfills DD^* perp AB. Thus, DD^* is perpendicular to m_c and plane ABC which ensures D_{1} lies on line m_c. b. Conversely, if D_1 lies on height m_c of ABC, the plane S' determined by DD_1 aligns perpendicularly to m_c since D_1 forms the height intersection point of ABC, leading AB to be perpendicular to any intersection points, particularly opposite CD. 2. **Completion of the proof:** Assuming a vertex's projection relates to the orthocenter on the face, it holds for all vertices by our auxiliary theorem implies AB perp CD and likewise for all edge pairs. Thus, the orthocentric property follows for any vertex: the projection aligns with the orthocenter proving that any vertex projects into the orthocenter on opposing faces. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The curve y = cos x cuts the line whose equation is y = cos 50^circ into segments having the successive ratios [dots p : q : p : q dots] with p < q.

According to the problem, 1/2 of the students are first-year students. So, the number of first-year students is (1/2)T. The rest of the students are second-year students, so the number of second-year students is also (1/2)T because the rest means the other half. Now, 4/5 of the first-year students have not declared a major. So, the number of first-year students who have not declared a major is (4/5)(1/2)T = (4/10)T = (2/5)T. This means that 1/5 of the first-year students have declared a major because 1 - 4/5 = 1/5. The fraction of second-year students who have declared a major is 1/3 times the fraction of first-year students who have declared a major. Since 1/5 of the first-year students have declared a major, the fraction of second-year students who have declared a major is (1/3)(1/5) = 1/15. Therefore, the fraction of second-year students who have not declared a major is 1 - 1/15 = 14/15. Since the number of second-year students is (1/2)T, the fraction of all the students in the dormitory who are second-year students who have not declared a major is (14/15)(1/2)T = (14/30)T = (7/15)T.

According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have: [ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ] We will use the properties of even and odd numbers to demonstrate that if the sides are integers with not all of them being even, then the hypotenuse must be an odd number, and one of the legs must be even while the other must be odd. **Step 1: Analyzing the Squares of Even and Odd Integers** 1. The square of an even integer is even. 2. The square of an odd integer is odd. **Step 2: Considering Various Cases** Given the equation (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we analyze the cases where (a), (b), and (c) can be even or odd: 1. **Case 1: Both (a) and (b) are even** If both (a) and (b) are even, then: [ a = 2m quad text{and} quad b = 2n ] where (m) and (n) are integers. Then: [ a^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2 quad text{and} quad b^2 = (2n)^2 = 4n^2 ] [ a^2 + b^2 = 4m^2 + 4n^2 = 4(m^2 + n^2) ] which means (a^2 + b^2) is even, confirming that (c^2) is even and thus (c) is also even. However, this case does not apply here as it requires all three sides to be even, contrary to our assumption that not all sides are even. 2. **Case 2: Both (a) and (b) are odd** If both (a) and (b) are odd, then: [ a = 2m + 1 quad text{and} quad b = 2n + 1 ] where (m) and (n) are integers. Then: [ a^2 = (2m + 1)^2 = 4m^2 + 4m + 1 quad text{and} quad b^2 = (2n + 1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 ] [ a^2 + b^2 = (4m^2 + 4m + 1) + (4n^2 + 4n + 1) = 4(m^2 + m + n^2 + n) + 2 ] Since (a^2 + b^2) in this case ends with 2, a number that is always even, it means (c^2 = 4k + 2), which is never a perfect square. Hence, this case is impossible within our given integer lengths. 3. **Case 3: One of (a) and (b) is even, the other is odd** Without loss of generality, suppose (a) is even ((a = 2m)) and (b) is odd ((b = 2n + 1)). Then: [ a^2 = (2m)^2 = 4m^2 quad text{and} quad b^2 = (2n + 1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 ] [ a^2 + b^2 = 4m^2 + 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 4(m^2 + n^2 + n) + 1 ] This implies: [ c^2 = 4(m^2 + n^2 + n) + 1 ] Clearly, (c^2 - 1) is divisible by 4, and thus (c^2) is of the form (4k + 1), indicative of an odd integer. Therefore, (c) must be odd. **Conclusion:** If in a right triangle with integer sides not all sides are even, then: 1. The hypotenuse (c) is always odd. 2. One leg (either (a) or (b)) is even, and the other leg is odd. Therefore, in an integer-sided right triangle, not all sides can be odd.

We seek the number of permutations where exactly 3 balls do not match their corresponding box numbers, which implies that the remaining 7 balls must be placed in the correctly numbered boxes. Let's define an arrangement where m specific balls do not match their corresponding box numbers as an \\"m-derangement.\\" The total number of ways that all 10 balls can be arranged is 10! (10 factorial), and the number of ways that 7 specific balls can be arranged correctly is 7!. However, we're only interested in arrangements where any 3 specific balls don't match. These are 3-derangements, which we'll denote as d(3). However, we don't want these 3 specific balls to be in the correct boxes in any order. Since we don't have a single ball in the correct box, the first incorrect ball has 9 options (since it can't go in its own box), the second one then has 8 options, and the third one has 7 options, but we need to account for rotations among the three incorrect placements: [ d(3) = frac{9 times 8 times 7}{3!} = 84. ] Now, in our actual arrangement, any 3 out of the 10 balls can be the ones that do not match. Therefore, we must choose which 3 balls will be deranged. There are binom{10}{3} ways to choose these 3 balls. The final count of arrangements where exactly 3 balls don't match their box numbers is then: [ binom{10}{3} cdot d(3) = binom{10}{3} cdot 84 = frac{10!}{3!7!} cdot 84 = frac{10 times 9 times 8}{3 times 2 times 1} times 84 = 120 times 7 = 840. ] However, this count includes some cases where more than 3 balls don't match. In other words, in the arrangement of the 3 specific balls that are not in their correct box, if there happens to be a box involved that also doesn't match the ball which is supposed to be there, that would mistakenly add to our count for the misplacements. To correct for this, notice that the solutions with more than three mismatches are counted multiple times in our calculations. Specifically, arrangements where exactly 4 balls are mismatched are counted binom{4}{3} times and should not be counted at all. Finding the number of 4-mismatches is similar to finding 3-derangements: [ d(4) = frac{9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{4!} = 126 ] Thus, we subtract binom{10}{4} times the 4-derangement count: [ binom{10}{4} cdot d(4) = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} times 126 = 210 times 126 = 26460. ] Every arrangement with exactly 4 mismatches has been counted binom{4}{3} = 4 times in the first calculation, so we divide this result by 4 to correct the count: [ frac{26460}{4} = 6615. ] Subtracting this from our original count: [ 840 - 6615 = boxed{-5775}. ] The negative result signifies that our initial approach of direct counting and subtracting the overcount is incorrect. This stems from the misunderstanding of the Inclusion-Exclusion principle in this specific context. An alternative approach is to recognize that the number of ways to correctly arrange the 7 other balls that are not part of the derangement is 1, because they must all go in their respective boxes. Finally, we recalculate considering only the 3 deranged balls and the 7 correctly placed ones: [ text{Correct arrangements} = binom{10}{3} cdot d(3) = frac{10 times 9 times 8}{3 times 2 times 1} times 84 = 120 times 84 = boxed{10080}. ] However, this is not one of the options given in the problem. Suspecting a misstep, let's revisit the concept of a derangement. The actual definition of a \\"derangement\\" of n objects is a permutation where none of the objects are in their original position. We found d(3) incorrectly before.

This implies that cosalpha < 0 because cosine is negative in the second quadrant. We can calculate cosalpha using the Pythagorean identity cos^2alpha = 1 - sin^2alpha: cosalpha = -sqrt{1-sin^{2}alpha} = -sqrt{1-left(frac{4}{5}right)^2} = -sqrt{1-frac{16}{25}} = -sqrt{frac{9}{25}} = -frac{3}{5}. Then, we find tanalpha using the definition tanalpha = frac{sinalpha}{cosalpha}: tanalpha = frac{sinalpha}{cosalpha} = frac{frac{4}{5}}{-frac{3}{5}} = -frac{4}{3}. To find tan(alpha-frac{pi}{4}), we use the tangent subtraction formula: tan(alpha-frac{pi}{4}) = frac{tanalpha - tanfrac{pi}{4}}{1 + tanalphatanfrac{pi}{4}} = frac{-frac{4}{3} - 1}{1 + (-frac{4}{3}cdot1)} = frac{-frac{4}{3} - frac{3}{3}}{1 - frac{4}{3}} = frac{-frac{7}{3}}{-frac{1}{3}} = 7.

We calculate sin(alpha-beta) using the Pythagorean identity sin^2(alpha-beta) = 1 - cos^2(alpha-beta): sin(alpha-beta) = sqrt{1-cos^{2}(alpha-beta)} = sqrt{1-left(frac{sqrt{10}}{10}right)^2} = sqrt{1-frac{10}{100}} = sqrt{frac{90}{100}} = frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}. To find sin beta, we use the sine subtraction formula sin beta = sin [alpha - (alpha - beta)]: sin beta = sin alpha cos (alpha - beta) - cos alpha sin (alpha - beta) = frac{4}{5} times frac{sqrt{10}}{10} - left(-frac{3}{5}right) times frac{3sqrt{10}}{10} = frac{4sqrt{10}}{50} + frac{9sqrt{10}}{50} = frac{13sqrt{10}}{50}.

First, let's convert the speeds from km/h to m/s: - Speed of the first train: 72 km/h = 72 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 20 m/s - Speed of the second train: 36 km/h = 36 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 10 m/s Since the trains are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the second train from the speed of the first train to get the relative speed: Relative speed = Speed of first train - Speed of second train Relative speed = 20 m/s - 10 m/s = 10 m/s Now, we know the time it takes for the first train to completely pass the second train is 63.99488040956724 seconds. During this time, the first train covers the distance equal to the length of the first train (L1) plus the length of the second train (L2).

A corner can be represented by an L-shaped figure, which typically occupies three squares in the grid. 4. **Strategically Position the Corners:** To ensure that every corner has exactly one star, we need to rotate and place these L-shaped corners strategically over the grid such that: - No corner must overlap with another. - Each star must be contained within one unique corner. 5. **Execute the Placement:** Let's consider a possible configuration as shown in the reference solution. Place and rotate L-shaped corners at different spots on the grid. - Place the first L-shaped corner at the top-left, covering one of the stars. - Place the second L-shaped corner rotated 90 degrees clockwise adjacent to the first, ensuring it covers another star. - Continue this pattern until all corners are placed and each star is uniquely covered without any overlaps. 6. **Check for Correctness and Adjust:** After placing the corners, verify that each one contains exactly one star and no two stars share the same corner.

Note that angles ( angle ADB ) and ( angle BEC ) are right angles. This implies that points ( D ) and ( E ) lie on the circle with diameter ( AC ) (denoted as (Omega)). The reason for this is that a diameter subtends a right angle to any point on the circle. - ( angle ADB = 90^circ implies DB text{ is a diameter of } Omega ) - ( angle BEC = 90^circ implies EC text{ is a diameter of } Omega ) 3.

However, we are not given the total distance, but we can use a variable to represent it and then calculate the average speed. Let's assume the total distance of the trip is D kilometers. Since the car travels each third of the distance at different speeds, we can divide the distance into three equal parts, each being D/3 kilometers. For the first third of the distance at 80 km/h: Time taken = Distance / Speed = (D/3) / 80 = D / (3 * 80) = D / 240 hours For the second third of the distance at 18 km/h: Time taken = Distance / Speed = (D/3) / 18 = D / (3 * 18) = D / 54 hours For the last third of the distance at 48 km/h: Time taken = Distance / Speed = (D/3) / 48 = D / (3 * 48) = D / 144 hours Now, we add up all the times to get the total time taken for the trip: Total time = D/240 + D/54 + D/144 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 240, 54, and 144 is 4320.

Consider the given circles odot O_1 and odot O_2 with radii R_1 and R_2 respectively. The circles intersect externally at a point Q. 2. Let AB be a common external tangent to odot O_1 and odot O_2, with A on odot O_1 and B on odot O_2. 3. Consider point P on the internal common tangent to odot O_1 and odot O_2 and not on the line segment AB. Let PA and PB intersect odot O_1 and odot O_2 at C and D respectively. 4. We need to show that the circle passing through points P, C, and D (denoted as odot O) intersects both odot O_1 and odot O_2 and find the radius of this circle. Proof: 1. Given that PQ is the internal common tangent segment to circles odot O_1 and odot O_2, we denote PQ = d and AB = a. Let E be the point where the internal tangent intersects AB. 2. Consider the configuration where P can be on various sections relative to EQ and QE. Without loss of generality, examine where P lies on the extension of EQ. 3. We use the power of a point (tangential segments): [ PA cdot PC = PQ^2 = PB cdot PD ] Hence, points A, C, D, and B are concyclic (i.e., they lie on a common circle). 4. From the concyclic property, we have: [ angle PCD = angle PBA ] 5. Construct line SDT cutting odot O_2 at points S and T. Since SD is a chord through point D and angle SDB = angle ABD, and also: [ angle SDB = angle PDT ] it follows that: [ angle PCD = angle PDT ] Therefore, the circle passing through points P, C, and D intersects odot O_2 at point D. 6. Similarly, odot O intersects odot O_1 at point C. 7. This proves that odot O intersects both odot O_1 and odot O_2. 8. Now, let R be the radius of the circle odot O determined by points P, C, D. By the sine rule in the triangle Delta PDC: [ 2R = frac{PC}{sin angle PDC} ] where sin angle PA B = sin angle PDC. 9. From the power of a point theorem: [ PA cdot PC = PQ^2 = d^2 implies PC = frac{d^2}{PA} ] 10. Thus, [ 2R = frac{frac{d^2}{PA}}{sin angle PAB} = frac{d^2}{PA sin angle PAB} = frac{d^2}{PE sin angle PEA} ] 11.

The function sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right) has a period of pi, which means the minimum positive period of f(x) is also pi. Thus, **A is correct**. - **B:** The graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point left(-frac{pi}{12}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right). When x = -frac{pi}{12}, sinleft(2left(-frac{pi}{12}right) + frac{pi}{6}right) = sin(0) = 0, so fleft(-frac{pi}{12}right) = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. This indicates symmetry about the point left(-frac{pi}{12}, -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right). Thus, **B is correct**. - **C:** The function |f(x)| is an even function. We find that |f(frac{pi}{12})| neq |f(-frac{pi}{12})|, which means |f(x)| is not an even function.

The condition f(x_8)+f(x_9)+f(x_{10})+f(x_{11})=0 implies that the sum of the function values at four consecutive terms of the sequence is zero. Due to the property of odd functions and the fact that the sequence has a common difference of 2, we can infer that x_8 and x_9 are symmetric about the origin with x_{10} and x_{11}, respectively. This means x_8 = -x_{11} and x_9 = -x_{10}. Given the arithmetic nature of the sequence, the middle point between x_8 and x_{11}, and between x_9 and x_{10}, is the origin. Therefore, x_9 and x_{10} are consecutive terms of the sequence that are on opposite sides of the origin, with x_9 being negative and x_{10} being positive, and their absolute values are equal due to the symmetry.

Since the grid is symmetric, any move by player 1 can be countered by a corresponding move by player 2. - Assume an X is placed at a position S by player 1. 2. **Defining Player 2’s strategy:** - Player 2 (I) will adopt a symmetry strategy. Specifically, I will make a move in the box S' which is the image of S under a 180^circ rotation about the center of the board. - The center of the 8 times 8 grid is at the intersection of the lines at the middle of the rows and columns, approximately around the coordinates (4.5, 4.5). The 180^circ rotation about this center is applied. 3. **Ensuring moves remain valid:** - The symmetry ensures that if S is an empty box, S' will also be empty at the beginning of any turn. - Since we start with an even-sized grid (64 boxes), applying the symmetry strategy ensures that a move in S always has a corresponding empty S'. - This means that S and S' are never the same boxes nor adjacent because they are symmetrically opposed on the grid. 4. **Winning the game:** - Because I can always respond to your move with another valid move (due to symmetry), I, playing as player 2, can always ensure that the board remains centrally symmetric after each of my turns. - The game proceeds until the grid is completely filled, which means the last move will ultimately fall to me, as player 2, providing I follow the symmetric strategy accurately. 5. **Analyzing the first move:** - Given this strategy, player 1 (you) cannot force a win because each of your moves can be mirrored, and player 2 will always have a legal move available. - Consequently, there are no moves that allow player 1 to guarantee a win, as the symmetry strategy ensures player 2 will never run out of moves first. # Conclusion: Based on the strategy outlined, the number of choices you have for a first move that will enable you to guarantee a win no matter how I play is: [ boxed{0} ]"},{"prompt":"Given ( frac{log{a}}{p}=frac{log{b}}{q}=frac{log{(c^d)}}{r}=log{x} ), all logarithms to the same base and ( x neq 1 ).

This means (A)'s list possibly includes the highest number of players compared to other participants' lists. 3. **Proof by Contradiction**: We aim to show that (A)'s list contains all the participants' names except (A)'s own. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there is a participant (B) with (B neq A) whose name does not appear on (A)'s list. 4. **Analysis of the Contradiction**: - Since (B) is not on (A)'s list, it implies that (B) must have defeated (A). Consequently, (A) would appear on (B)'s list. - Additionally, (B)'s list must contain all the players (A) has defeated. This is because, by defeating (A), (B) establishes a transitive chain of victories over all the players (A) has defeated. 5. **Transitive Victories**: Consider a player (C) who was defeated by a player (D) (where (D) was defeated by (A)). If (D) had also defeated (B), then (A) should have (B) on the list, which leads to a contradiction. 6. **Conclusion from D's Defeat by B**: - Since (D) did not defeat (B), we conclude that (B) must have defeated (D), which means (C) appears on (B)'s list. - This argument generalizes to show that anyone defeated by someone defeated by (A) must also be on (B)'s list. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, (B)'s list contains the name of (A) and all the names on (A)'s list plus possibly more names, making (B)'s list strictly longer than (A)'s list. This contradicts our initial assumption that (A)'s list is as long as possible. 8. **Final Statement**: Hence, our assumption that (B) was not on (A)'s list leads to a contradiction.

Let's first calculate the maximum number of helicopters we can make: 250 toys / 3 toys per sheet = 83.33 sheets Since we can't use a fraction of a sheet, we would use 83 sheets to make helicopters, which would give us: 83 sheets * 3 helicopters per sheet = 249 helicopters This leaves us with 1 toy to reach 250, and we can make this either a boat or a plane. Since we want to minimize the number of sheets for boats, we'll make a plane. This requires 1/5 of a sheet. So, we have used 83 sheets for helicopters and 1/5 of a sheet for a plane. Since we can't use less than a full sheet for a boat, we would need at least 1 more sheet to make boats. Therefore, the minimum number of sheets needed to make paper boats is boxed{1} sheet, assuming we use the other sheets to make helicopters and planes to reach the total of 250 paper toys."},{"prompt":"the triangular pyramid PABC, PAbot base ABC, AB=2, AC=AP, BCbot CA.

Additionally, because BC is also perpendicular to CA, and the intersection of CA and PA is at point A, it follows that BC is perpendicular to the plane PAC. Given that PB is the common hypotenuse of the right triangles PBC and PBA, it serves as the diameter of the circumscribed sphere of the pyramid.

Assume the side of the flag is 1 unit, making the area of the flag 1^2 = 1 square unit. 2. Given that the entire cross occupies 49% of the flag's area, this area is 0.49 square units. 3. If we dissect the flag like in the original problem, we can assume each quarter of the flag will have a similar arrangement, with part of the cross and part of the orange center. 4. To simplify, assume that each arm of the green cross plus the orange center forms a smaller square within the large square flag. As in the earlier problem, let's assume the side of each smaller square is k. Then, the area of one smaller square is k^2. 5. Since the cross occupies 49% of the total area, the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares (which form the cross when rearranged) should equal 0.49 square units. 6. Assuming symmetry and equal division, each smaller square would then occupy half of this area, i.e., 0.245 square units. 7. If we now consider the orange square (center of the cross) to be at a new scaled size within this setup, assume it is a square of side t. Immediately, we know that it must be smaller, so let's set it as t = 0.1k. 8. Thus, the area of the orange square is (0.1k)^2 = 0.01k^2. 9. As we established that one smaller green and orange square together occupy 0.245 square units, and assuming the cross arms and the orange square are proportionally adjusted to maintain the 49% total occupation, then the orange square in the center could be adjusted to maintain a visual and area balance. 10. The most straightforward assumption is that the orange square's area is exactly 10% of each smaller green and orange square's area, which is 0.0245 square units. 11.

The solutions to this inequality are xleq 0 or xgeq 3. Therefore, we can express set B as B={x|xleq 0 text{ or } xgeq 3}. For set A, we have the inequality 0<x-m<2, which can be rewritten as m<x<m+2. Thus, set A is expressed as A={x|m<x<m+2}. (1) To satisfy the condition Acap B=emptyset, there should be no overlap between sets A and B. This leads us to the following system of inequalities: begin{cases} m geq 3, m+2 leq 0. end{cases} However, these two inequalities are mutually exclusive and cannot be satisfied simultaneously. We need to revise this to consider the correct conditions for disjoint sets. To ensure A and B are disjoint, A should be entirely to the right of B on the number line. Thus, we have to position set A such that m+2leq 0 or to position A entirely to the right of 3, which would mean mgeq 3. Since m+2leq 0 leads to mleq -2, we combine these to get mleq -2 or m geq 3. Step by step, we re-analyze this: 1. A must not intersect with the portion of B where xleq 0. So, m+2leq 0 or mleq -2. 2. A must also not intersect with the portion of B where xgeq 3. So, mgeq 3. The final range for m which ensures Acap B=emptyset is: mleq -2 text{ or } mgeq 3. We represent the final answer as: boxed{mleq -2 text{ or } mgeq 3} (2) To satisfy the condition Acup B=B, set A must be a subset of B; in other words, every element of A must also be an element of B. This occurs when the set A is either completely to the left of B or contained within the right side of B: 1. If A is completely to the left of B, this would mean m+2leq 0 or mleq -2. 2. If A is contained within the right side of B, this would mean mgeq 3. Therefore, the range for m which satisfies Acup B=B is: mleq -2 text{ or } mgeq 3.

Since we are arranging all 6 fans, n = r = 6, so the total number of arrangements is n = A_6^6 = frac{6!}{(6-6)!} = 6! = 720. 2. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange male and female fans alternately**: There are two scenarios for alternate arrangements: starting with a male or starting with a female. For each scenario, we arrange the 3 male fans and the 3 female fans in their respective positions. The number of ways to arrange the 3 male fans is A_3^3 = 3! = 6, and similarly, the number of ways to arrange the 3 female fans is A_3^3 = 3! = 6. Therefore, for one scenario (either starting with male or female), the number of arrangements is A_3^3 times A_3^3 = 6 times 6 = 36. Since there are two scenarios, we multiply by 2, giving us m = 2 times A_3^3 times A_3^3 = 2 times 36 = 72. 3. **Calculate the probability of arranging male and female fans alternately**: The probability is the ratio of the number of alternate arrangements to the total number of arrangements, which is P = frac{m}{n} = frac{72}{720} = frac{1}{10}.

Hence, [ x = frac{d + frac{k}{d}}{2} ] is not an integer. Therefore, there are no integer solutions. 3. **Case 3: ( 4 mid k ).** Here, both ( d ) and ( frac{k}{d} ) must be even. For this, the power of 2 in each divisor of ( k ), denoted ( beta_1 ), ranges between [ 1 leq beta_1 leq alpha_1 - 1 ] The other prime factors can freely contribute any value of their exponent, and each different divisor corresponds to a unique pair ( (x, y) ). Therefore, the count of solutions is: [ 2 (alpha_1 - 1)(alpha_2 + 1) cdots (alpha_m + 1) ] Now applying this to our given values of ( n ): - For ( n = 1992 ): [ k = 1992^2 = (2^3 cdot 3 cdot 83)^2 = 2^6 cdot 3^2 cdot 83^2 ] This fits Case 3 since ( 4 mid k ). Hence, the number of solutions is: [ 2 cdot 5 cdot 3 cdot 3 = 90 ] - For ( n = 1993 ): [ k = 1993^2 ] Since 1993 is odd, this fits Case 1. Thus, [ 2 cdot 1 cdot 1 = 2 ] But in this case, we need ( 2 cdot 3 ) for extra pairs involving signs. Thus, [ 2 cdot 3 = 6 ] - For ( n = 1994 ): [ k = 1994^2 = (2 cdot 997)^2 = 2^2 cdot 997^2 ] This fits Case 3, so the number of solutions is: [ 2 cdot 1 cdot 3 = 6 ] **Conclusion:** For ( n = 1992 ), the number of integer solutions is ( 90 ). For ( n = 1993 ), the number of integer solutions is ( 6 ). For ( n = 1994 ), the number of integer solutions is ( 6 ).

We need to find the probability that after some time, there will be no organisms left. 2. ***Classifying the problem:*** This is a classic problem of random walk, particularly a special case often referred to as a gambler’s ruin problem, which can be described as follows: - Each time period (we assume each second for simplicity), the number of organisms can either increase by one (with probability (p = 0.6)) or decrease by one (with probability (q = 0.4)). 3. ***Defining the states:*** Let (v_k) be the probability that the population eventually becomes extinct starting from (k) organisms. We are interested in finding (v_1), the probability that starting with one organism, the population eventually becomes extinct. 4. ***Writing the balance equations:*** Consider the following scenarios: - With probability (p = 0.6), the population increases to (k+1). - With probability (q = 0.4), the population decreases to (k-1). Using these possibilities, we set up the equation for (v_k): [ v_k = p v_{k+1} + q v_{k-1} ] where (v_0 = 1) since if there are 0 organisms, the population is certainly extinct. 5. ***Solving the equation:*** For (v_1), consider the starting population of one organism.

Generally, such equations are solved by looking for a fixed point or via direct methods for small systems. Here, given that reducing the population eventually must lead to extinction, (v_k) approaches the probability as a geometric series' solution. 8. ***Boundary conditions and solution:*** From boundary considerations: As (k) increases, (v_k) approaches a finite limit due to the population extinction condition. The solution cab be deduced using constraints over limits or equating linear iterations. [ v_1 = frac{q}{p} ] Given (p = 0.6) and (q = 0.4): [ v_1 = frac{0.4}{0.6} = frac{2}{3} ] 9. ***Conclusion:*** The probability that the population eventually becomes extinct, starting with one organism, is: [ boxed{frac{2}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"We colored four points with four different colors: red, blue, green, and yellow.

These points are colored with four different colors: red, blue, green, and yellow. 2. **Coloring of Line Segments**: Each line segment connecting two points gets the color of either endpoint. Since we are required to use all four colors again when coloring these segments, it implies that each point must be connected by segments of at least two different colors. 3. **Initial Assumption**: Consider the points ( P_1 ) (Red), ( P_2 ) (Blue), and ( P_3 ) (Green). We will analyze the segments determined by these three points first. 4. **Checking Specific Coloring Conditions**: - If the three segments ( P_1P_2 ), ( P_2P_3 ), and ( P_3P_1 ) are colored red, blue, and green respectively, then point ( P_4 ) (Yellow) satisfies condition (b), as these segments use each of red, blue, and green exactly once. 5. **Exploring Other Cases**: - Suppose condition (b) does not hold for point ( P_4 ). This implies that within the segments ( P_1P_2 ), ( P_2P_3 ), or ( P_3P_1 ), at least two segments share the same color. - Without loss of generality, assume two segments are colored red and one segment is colored blue. Let's say ( P_1P_2 ) and ( P_1P_3 ) are red, and ( P_2P_3 ) is blue. 6. **Condition with Green Point**: - Since each point must have a segment in its own color due to the requirement to use all four colors again, consider point ( P_3 ) (Green). - ( P_3 ) must have a green segment connected to one of the other points. Hence, suppose ( P_3P_4 ) is green. 7. **Conclusion on Condition (a)**: - Given the connections, point ( P_3 ) now has one red segment (( P_1P_3 )), one blue segment (( P_2P_3 )), and one green segment (( P_3P_4 )). - Thus, condition (a) is met for point ( P_3 ), as three segments meeting at ( P_3 ) are of three different colors (red, blue, and green). 8. **Validity of the Assumptions**: - The above logic can be repeated for any permutation of the colors red, blue, green, and yellow. - The conditions and the need to re-use all four colors ensure that if ( b) ) isn't satisfied for any of the points other than yellow, ( a) ) will hold true for one of the colored points excluding yellow.

The total cost of the mixture should be: ( 45 text{ pounds} times 6.00/text{pound} = 270.00 ) Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the mixture: ( 120.00 + 30x = 270.00 ) To find ( x ), we solve for it: ( 30x = 270.00 - 120.00 ) ( 30x = 150.00 ) ( x = 150.00 / 30 ) ( x = 5.00 ) So, the cost per pound of the second type of candy is boxed{5.00} ."},{"prompt":"A certain clothing company's job advertisement promises that skilled workers will earn at least 3000 yuan per month. They work 8 hours a day for 25 days a month. The monthly base salary is 800 yuan, with additional piecework wages.

It was found that a skilled worker takes 4 hours to process 1 A type clothing item and 2 B type clothing items, and 7 hours to process 3 A type clothing items and 1 B type clothing item.

If a skilled worker processes a A type clothing items per month, and the total wage is W yuan. Please use the knowledge you have learned to determine whether the company has violated the advertising promise after implementing this rule?","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Let's denote the number of hours a skilled worker takes to process 1 A type clothing item as x, and the number of hours to process 1 B type clothing item as y. Given the information, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. For processing 1 A type and 2 B type clothing items in 4 hours: x + 2y = 4 2. For processing 3 A type and 1 B type clothing items in 7 hours: 3x + y = 7 Solving this system of equations, we start with the first equation: x + 2y = 4 From the second equation: 3x + y = 7 Multiplying the first equation by 3 and subtracting the second equation from it, we get: 3(x + 2y) - (3x + y) = 3(4) - 7 This simplifies to: 3x + 6y - 3x - y = 12 - 7 Which further simplifies to: 5y = 5 Therefore, y = 1. Substituting y = 1 into the first equation: x + 2(1) = 4 This simplifies to: x + 2 = 4 Therefore, x = 2. So, it takes boxed{2 text{ hours}} for a skilled worker to process 1 A type clothing item, and boxed{1 text{ hour}} to process 1 B type clothing item. Part 2: Given that a skilled worker processes a A type clothing items in a month, they can process (25 times 8 - 2a) B type clothing items, considering the time constraints and the processing times found in part 1. The total wage W can be calculated as: W = 16a + 12(25 times 8 - 2a) + 800 Simplifying this, we get: W = 16a + 12(200 - 2a) + 800 W = 16a + 2400 - 24a + 800 W = -8a + 3200 Given the constraint that a geq frac{1}{2}(25 times 8 - 2a), solving for a gives: a geq 50 Since the coefficient of a in the wage equation is negative (-8 < 0), it means that as a increases, W decreases. Therefore, when a = 50, W reaches its maximum possible value under the given constraints, which can be calculated as: W = -8(50) + 3200 = 2800 Since 2800 < 3000, we conclude that the clothing company violates the advertising promise after implementing the rule, as the maximum possible wage is less than the promised 3000 yuan.

Prove that all of its coefficients are rational.","completion":"To prove the given assertion, we use mathematical induction with respect to ( n ). Induction Hypothesis: Assume that any polynomial of degree ( n ) that takes rational values at ( n+1 ) rational points must have all its coefficients rational. Base Case: Consider a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree 0, which is a constant polynomial. - A constant polynomial that takes rational values at any point is itself a rational number. - Therefore, the polynomial is of the form ( P(x) = c ) where ( c in mathbb{Q} ), i.e., ( c ) is rational. - This satisfies the condition as all (in this case, the only) coefficients are rational, making our base case valid. Induction Step: Assume the hypothesis is true for a polynomial of degree ( n-1 ). **Objective**: Prove it for a polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( n ). Given: - ( P(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ), - ( P(x) ) takes rational values at ( n+1 ) distinct rational points ( x_0, x_1, ldots, x_n ). Using the fact that ( P(x) ) takes rational values at these points: [ P(x_i) = r_i quad text{where} quad r_i in mathbb{Q}, quad text{for} quad i=0,1,ldots,n. ] By the properties of polynomials: [ P(x) - P(x_0) = (x - x_0)Q(x) ] where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n-1 ). Now, evaluating ( Q(x) ) at ( x = x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ), [ P(x_i) - P(x_0) = (x_i - x_0)Q(x_i) ] [ Q(x_i) = frac{P(x_i) - P(x_0)}{x_i - x_0} ] where both ( P(x_i) ) and ( P(x_0) ) are rational numbers and ( x_i - x_0 neq 0 ) since ( x_i ) and ( x_0 ) are distinct rational points. Since the numerator ( P(x_i) - P(x_0) ) and denominator ( x_i - x_0 ) are rational, their ratio ( Q(x_i) ) is also rational for ( i=1,2,ldots, n ). By the induction hypothesis, since ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n-1 ) taking rational values at ( n ) rational points, all coefficients of ( Q(x) ) must be rational. Then, rewriting ( P(x) ) in terms of ( Q(x) ): [ P(x) = (x - x_0)Q(x) + P(x_0) ] Expressing this polynomial: - ( (x - x_0)Q(x) ) results in a degree ( n ) polynomial where the coefficients of ( (x - x_0) ) and ( Q(x) ) are rational. - Therefore, the product maintains rational coefficients. - As ( P(x_0) ) is a rational number, it adds a rational constant term to the polynomial. Hence, ( P(x) ), a polynomial of degree ( n ), must have rational coefficients since all its terms are rational. By the principle of mathematical induction, the assertion holds true for all ( n ).

It is given that lines passing through the endpoints of one of the bases and parallel to the opposite sides intersect on the circumcircle of the trapezoid. We need to find the ratio of the lengths of the two bases. 2. **Prove the Lines Cannot Pass Through Both Ends of the Larger Base**: Suppose the lines pass through points (A) and (D) of the larger base (AD) and intersect at point (M) on the circumcircle of the trapezoid. Given the line (AM) is parallel to (CD), we get: [ angle MAD = angle BAD = 75^circ ] Similarly, [ angle MAD = 75^circ ] The internal angle of triangle (AMD) at (M) can be calculated as: [ angle AMD = 180^circ - 2 times 75^circ = 30^circ ] Since points (M) and (B) lie on opposite sides of chord (AD): [ angle ABD = 180^circ - angle AMD = 150^circ ] This is impossible because the angle (ABD) is part of (angle ABC) which equals (105^circ). 3. **Consider Lines Passing Through Ends of the Smaller Base**: Next, suppose the lines pass through points (B) and (C) (the ends of the smaller base) and intersect at (M) on the circumcircle of trapezoid (ABCD). The angle (angle BMC) can be calculated by subtracting the angles at (B) and (C): [ angle BMC = 180^circ - (angle MBC + angle MCB) = 180^circ - (angle ADC + angle BAD) = 180^circ - 150^circ = 30^circ ] Since points (M) and (A) are on the same side of chord (BD): [ angle BMD = angle BAD = 75^circ ] Therefore, [ angle AMB = angle CMD = angle BMD - angle BMC = 75^circ - 30^circ = 45^circ ] The angle (angle AMD) would be: [ angle AMD = angle AMB + angle BMC + angle CMD = 30^circ + 45^circ + 45^circ = 120^circ ] 4. **Calculate the Ratio of the Bases**: Let (R) be the radius of the circumcircle.

The prime factorization of 16 is 2^4. The GCD of 20 and 16 is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors, which in this case is 2^2 = 4. So, 20 * 16 = 4. Now, we are given that the GCD of (20 * 16) and (18 * b) is 2. We already know that 20 * 16 = 4, so we are looking for the GCD of 4 and (18 * b). The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. Since the GCD of 4 and (18 * b) is 2, it means that the only prime factor they have in common is 2, and it's to the first power because the GCD is 2. Therefore, b must not have 2 as a prime factor because if it did, the GCD would be greater than 2 (since 18 already has a factor of 2). Also, b must not have 3 as a prime factor because if it did, the GCD would include a factor of 3 due to the 3^2 in 18, which would make the GCD greater than 2. Thus, b must be a number whose prime factors do not include 2 or 3. The smallest such number is 1, but since we are looking for a GCD of 2, b must contribute a factor of 2 to the GCD. Since 18 already has a factor of 2, b must not contribute any factors of 2 or 3 to keep the GCD at 2. Therefore, b can be any number that is not divisible by 2 or 3. The simplest such number is 1.

Each tuna weighs 200 pounds, so 10% reserved for his family is: 10% of 200 pounds = 0.10 * 200 = 20 pounds This means he can sell: 200 pounds - 20 pounds = 180 pounds of each tuna Since he has 10 tuna, the total amount of tuna he can sell is: 180 pounds/tuna * 10 tuna = 1800 pounds Now, let's see how he can accommodate the customers with specific weight preferences. For the 10 customers who want exactly 30-pound pieces, he needs: 10 customers * 30 pounds/customer = 300 pounds For the 15 customers who want exactly 20-pound pieces, he needs: 15 customers * 20 pounds/customer = 300 pounds So, the total weight reserved for customers with specific preferences is: 300 pounds + 300 pounds = 600 pounds Subtracting this from the total sellable weight, we get: 1800 pounds - 600 pounds = 1200 pounds available for other customers. Each of the remaining customers wants 25 pounds of tuna. The number of 25-pound portions Mr. Ray can provide from the 1200 pounds is: 1200 pounds / 25 pounds/portion = 48 portions So, 48 customers can be served with 25-pound portions.

So, (A) is not the spy. Since (B) confirms (A)'s truth, (B) is a liar. This makes (C) the knight. - If (A) is the spy, he told the truth. Since (B) confirms (A)'s truth, (B) is the knight. Therefore, (C) must be the liar. 2.

Since (B), who is the spy, confirms (A)'s truth, (C) must be the liar. - If (A) is the spy, he lied, thus actually the spy. This occasions (B) to be the liar, and (C) should be the knight. 2. Thus, the assignments are: - **2a: (A) (knight), (B) (spy), (C) (liar)** - **2b: (A) (spy), (B) (liar), (C) (knight)** Case 3: (A) said \\"yes\\" to being the spy and (B) said \\"no\\" 1. **(A) must be (liar or spy)**: - If (A) is a liar, his lie about being the spy means he is not the spy. Since (B) claims (A) lied, (B) is telling the truth and must be the knight. (C) then must be the spy. - If (A) is the spy, (B) denying the truth makes (B) the liar. Therefore, (C) is the knight. 2.

We consider any two points and connect them with a line; since there are three points, these lines will form the sides of a triangle. Thus, there are ( binom{3}{2} = 3 ) lines connecting these points, which coincides with our requirement of having ( n = 3 ) different lines. The base case holds. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume the proposition holds for ( n - 1 ) points, i.e., any ( n - 1 ) points that do not lie on the same line have at least ( n - 1 ) distinct lines connecting some pairs of these points. 3. **Induction Step**: We need to show that the proposition holds for ( n ) points. Suppose ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) are ( n ) points such that no three of them are collinear. - Consider removing one point from the ( n ) points; without loss of generality, let us remove ( A_n ). By the induction hypothesis, the remaining ( n - 1 ) points, ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n-1} ), are connected by at least ( n - 1 ) distinct lines. - Now, consider adding back the point ( A_n ). We need to form lines connecting ( A_n ) to the ( n - 1 ) points. Let ( A_n ) be joined with each of ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n-1} ), which creates ( n - 1 ) additional lines. - Each new line ( A_nA_i ) where ( i in {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ) is distinct because the initial points are not collinear, ensuring the new lines are distinct from those formed among the initial ( n - 1 ) points. - Thus, the total number must be at least ( n-1 ) (from the induction hypothesis) plus ( n-1 ) more new distinct lines. However, since the new lines connect only once with past lines and those initially, they form ( n ) lines now counted as combining. 4. **Conclusion**: Since, ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) points form at least ( n ) distinct lines joining these points, our initial hypothesis holds for ( n ) points based on the induction steps above. boxed{n}"},{"prompt":"Given that x frac{1}{x} = 5, what is x^4 frac{1}{x^4}?","completion":"To find x^4 - frac{1}{x^4}, we start by finding {(x - frac{1}{x})}^2: [ {x}^2 - 2x(frac{1}{x}) + frac{1}{x^2} = (x - frac{1}{x})^2 = 5^2 = 25 ] This can be rewritten as: [ x^2 + frac{1}{x^2} = 25 + 2 = 27 ] Next, to find x^4 + frac{1}{x^4}, we use (x^2 + frac{1}{x^2})^2: [ (x^2 + frac{1}{x^2})^2 = x^4 + 2 + frac{1}{x^4} = 27^2 = 729 ] Thus: [ x^4 + frac{1}{x^4} = 729 - 2 = 727 ] Finally, for x^4 - frac{1}{x^4}, the expression becomes: [ (x^2 + frac{1}{x^2})^2 - 4(x^2 cdot frac{1}{x^2}) = 727 - 4 = 723 ] Therefore: [ x^4 - frac{1}{x^4} = boxed{723} ]"},{"prompt":"Let (z= frac{1i}{1+i}+2i ), then (left|zright|= ) A: (0) B: (frac{1}{2} ) C: (1) D: (sqrt{2} )","completion":"**Analysis** This question tests the student's ability to perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers, which is relatively easy. **Solution** (z= frac{1-i}{1+i}+2i =frac{(1-i)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)}= frac{-2i}{2}=-i ;) (left|zright|= sqrt{(0^2+1^2)}=1 ), Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"Given a+b=7 and ab=6, find:<br/>① the value of a^{2}+b^{2};<br/>② the value of a^{3}b2a^{2}b^{2}+ab^{3}.","completion":"To solve the given problem, we proceed as follows: **For ①, finding the value of a^{2}+b^{2}:** Given a+b=7 and ab=6, we can express a^{2}+b^{2} in terms of these equations.

Using the Law of Sines, we get: [ frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} ] Substituting the known values: [ frac{8}{sin A} = frac{7}{sin 60^circ} ] Knowing that sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we obtain: [ frac{8}{sin A} = frac{7}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{14}{sqrt{3}} ] Solving for sin A: [ sin A = frac{8 cdot sqrt{3}}{14} = frac{4 sqrt{3}}{7} ] 3. Next, we find cos A using the identity sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1: [ cos^2 A = 1 - sin^2 A = 1 - left(frac{4sqrt{3}}{7}right)^2 = 1 - frac{48}{49} = frac{1}{49} ] Thus: [ cos A = pm sqrt{frac{1}{49}} = pm frac{1}{7} ] 4. To find cos C, we use the identity for the cosine of the sum of angles. Since C = 180^circ - (A + 60^circ) and cos(180^circ - theta) = -cos(theta), we have: [ cos C = cos(A + 60^circ) ] 5. Using the cosine addition formula: [ cos(A + 60^circ) = cos A cos 60^circ - sin A sin 60^circ ] Substituting the values: [ cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2} quad text{and} quad sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] We get: [ cos(A + 60^circ) = left(pm frac{1}{7}right) left(frac{1}{2}right) - left(frac{4sqrt{3}}{7}right) left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) ] 6. Simplifying further: [ cos(A + 60^circ) = pm frac{1}{14} - frac{12}{14} = pm frac{1}{14} - frac{6}{7} ] 7. Obtaining the two possible values: [ cos(A + 60^circ) = frac{1}{14} - frac{12}{14} = -frac{11}{14} ] Or: [ cos(A + 60^circ) = -frac{1}{14} - frac{12}{14} = -frac{13}{14} ] # Conclusion: The possible values of cos C are: [ boxed{-frac{11}{14} text{ or } -frac{13}{14}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let (a, b, c, d, e) be distinct real numbers.

(2) For any four castles, if there are roads between any two of them, then for any one castle among them, the roads from it toward the other three castles cannot all have three guards.

Each pair of castles can have at most one road between them, and each road can have up to four guards. We need to prove that the total number of guards on all roads is at most ( N^2 ). 2. **Introduce Zykov Symmetrization:** Zykov symmetrization is a technique used in extremal graph theory. It involves replacing vertices in a graph to maintain or increase certain properties while simplifying the structure. Let ( f(v) ) denote the number of guards on some edge adjacent to a vertex ( v ). If ( f(v) > f(w) ) where ( v ) and ( w ) are not adjacent, we can delete ( w ) and replace it with a copy ( v' ) of ( v ) (with the same number of guards on edges). 3. **Preserve properties using Zykov Symmetrization:** This operation preserves the desired properties of the graph. If some edge ( overline{uv'} ) is part of a ( K_3 ) (triangle), then ( overline{uv} ) was part of an isomorphic ( K_3 ) pre-replacement. The same holds if ( overline{uv'} ) is part of a ( K_4 ) (complete graph on four vertices). Hence, copying the number of guards on ( overline{uv} ) works and increases the total number of guards. 4. **Consider a graph ( G ) with a maximal number of guards:** We claim that ( G ) is a complete multipartite graph. If we have vertices ( u, v, w ) such that ( u ) is not adjacent to ( v ) or ( w ), but ( overline{vw} ) is an edge, we can delete both ( v ) and ( w ) and replace them with copies of ( u ). Since any optimal graph will have at least two guards on every edge, the number of guards on ( overline{vw} ) pre-replacement is double-counted in ( f(v) + f(w) ), hence the total number of guards will increase with this operation. Thus, in an optimal graph, anti-adjacency is transitive, implying the desired claim. 5. **Analyze different cases:** - **Case 1: ( G ) is bipartite.** A bipartite graph has at most ( frac{N^2}{4} ) edges, and hence at most ( N^2 ) guards. - **Case 2: ( G ) is 3-partite.** A 3-partite graph has at most ( frac{N^2}{3} ) edges. Since every edge is part of a triangle, it has at most ( N^2 ) guards. - **Case 3: ( G ) is ( k )-partite, where ( k geq 4 ).** Every edge is part of a ( K_4 ). For any vertex ( v ), there are at most two ( k )-partite \\"independent sets\\" such that there exists an edge from ( v ) to these independent sets having 3 guards—all the others must have 2 guards. Take the largest independent set, which contains ( i ) vertices, and pick a vertex from it. This vertex has ( N-i ) edges connected to it, and at most ( 2i ) of them can have 3 guards. Hence, [ f(v) leq 3(2i) + 2(N - 3i) = 2N, ] with equality only holding if the two other independent sets we pick are also maximal. If there exists some ( f(v) leq 2N - 1 ) (where ( v ) is in a maximal independent set), we can delete it and apply the inductive hypothesis to the remaining graph. Otherwise, if equality holds for every vertex, then no vertex ( w ) in a non-maximal independent set can be in an edge with 3 guards, so there are at most ( 2(N-1) ) guards on the edges of ( w ). We can delete it and induct down as well. If there are no non-maximal independent sets, i.e., every independent set has size ( i ), summing ( f(v) leq 2N ) over every vertex yields the desired result. 6. **Conclusion:** Combining these cases, we conclude that the total number of guards on roads in Kingdom Wierdo is at most ( N^2 ).

This step is essential as it simplifies subsequent analyses into smaller, more manageable parts. 3. **Understanding the Unit Cells and Triangled Halves:** On the dotted grid formed, our polygonal chain intersects some of the quarter squares creating fragments, specifically half squares and triangular halves. 4. **Counting the Contribution of Each Cell Type:** - **Full Squares:** Since the original chessboard coloring ensures that each 1 times 1 cell contains equal areas of black and white. - **Triangles along diagonal cuts:** If a cell is split diagonally by the path, the two resulting triangles are of equal area, where one side of the triangle will be white and the other black due to the uniformity of the original coloring of the chessboard. 5. **Ensuring Equal Areas in Subdivided Regions:** At each intersection of the path and the dotted grid, the regions created still hold the property where each subdivided unit square or triangular half contains equal areas of both black and white segments. 6. **Summing Up the Areas:** Observing the configuration: - Each full unit cell split by the chain contributes equally to both black and white color areas. - Each triangle results from splitting retains balanced areas due to uniform cuts through color switches. 7. **Final Conclusion:** By combining the equal color areas in all individual segments and integrating them over the broken line's enclosed region, it follows mathematically that the total enclosed black area equals the total enclosed white area. Thus, we prove: [ text{The total area of black segments equals the total area of white segments within the enclosed region formed by the polygonal chain.} ] This equal area allocation is regardless of the path specifics or the detailed layout inside the enclosed region. Therefore, the conclusion is: (boxed{text{The total area of black segments is equal to the total area of white segments.}})"},{"prompt":"Solve [frac{x}{x^2 + x 6} ge 0.] Enter your answer using interval notation.","completion":"First, factorize the denominator: [x^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3).] The critical points (where the expression changes sign or is undefined) are (x = -3) and (x = 2).

What was the train's average speed when traveling from point y to point z?","completion":"Let's denote the distance from point x to point y as 2d and the distance from point y to point z as d. This is because the distance from x to y is twice the distance from y to z. The train's average speed from x to y is 300 mph, so the time it takes to travel from x to y is ( frac{2d}{300} ) hours. We don't know the train's average speed from y to z, so let's call it v. The time it takes to travel from y to z is ( frac{d}{v} ) hours. The total distance from x to z is 2d + d = 3d. The train's average speed from x to z is given as 180 mph, so the total time it takes to travel from x to z is ( frac{3d}{180} ) hours. Now, we can set up an equation for the total time based on the two segments: [ frac{2d}{300} + frac{d}{v} = frac{3d}{180} ] To solve for v, we can multiply through by the common denominator, which is 900v: [ 6vd + 900d = 15vd ] Now, we can subtract 6vd from both sides: [ 900d = 9vd ] Divide both sides by 9d: [ 100 = v ] So, the train's average speed when traveling from point y to point z was boxed{100} miles per hour."},{"prompt":"A quart of paint covers 60 square feet. It costs 32 to paint the outside of a cube 10 feet on each edge. How much does a quart of paint cost?","completion":"First, we need to calculate the total surface area of the cube that needs to be painted. A cube has 6 faces, and each face is a square with an area equal to the length of one side squared. The area of one face of the cube is: 10 feet * 10 feet = 100 square feet Since there are 6 faces on a cube, the total surface area to be painted is: 6 * 100 square feet = 600 square feet We know that a quart of paint covers 60 square feet. To find out how many quarts are needed to cover 600 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage of one quart: 600 square feet / 60 square feet per quart = 10 quarts The cost to paint the cube is 32, and this cost is for the 10 quarts of paint needed. To find the cost of one quart, we divide the total cost by the number of quarts: 32 / 10 quarts = 3.20 per quart Therefore, a quart of paint costs boxed{3.20} ."},{"prompt":"Caleb, Andy and Billy went on a picnic with their father.

When their father bought a packet of 36 candies, he gave 8 to Billy and 11 to Caleb. So, the number of candies left for Andy from the packet is: 36 (total candies) - 8 (Billy's candies) - 11 (Caleb's candies) = 36 - 8 - 11 = 17 candies. Now, Andy has 17 candies from the packet plus the A candies he took with him, which equals A + 17. We are told that Andy now has 4 more candies than Caleb. Caleb originally took 11 candies and received another 11 from the packet, so he has a total of 11 + 11 = 22 candies.

In the Cartesian plane, a cyclic polygon ( P ) with area ( S ) is chosen. All its vertices have integral coordinates, and the squares of its side lengths are all divisible by ( n ).

Additionally, the squares of its side lengths are divisible by n. We need to show that 2S is an integer divisible by n. 2. **Using Shoelace Formula**: By the Shoelace Formula, the area of any polygon with integral coordinates is a half-integer. Hence, 2S is an integer. 3. **Base Case**: Let's start with the simplest case when the polygon is a triangle (k = 3). Let the side lengths of P be sqrt{na}, sqrt{nb}, sqrt{nc} where a, b, c are positive integers. According to Heron's Formula, [ 16S^2 = n^2 left( 2ab + 2bc + 2ca - a^2 - b^2 - c^2 right). ] This shows that 16S^2 is divisible by n^2 and since n is odd, it follows that 2S is divisible by n. 4. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume the statement is true for polygons with k geq 4 sides. Specifically, assume that for any such polygon whose side squares are divisible by n, 2S is an integer divisible by n. 5. **Consider Diagonals**: If the square of the length of one of the diagonals is divisible by n, then that diagonal divides P into two smaller polygons, to which the induction hypothesis applies. 6. **Claim**: Suppose none of the squares of the diagonal lengths in P is divisible by n.

If ( a_2 ) and ( b_2 ) do not overlap with ( d ), they prove the statement for ( P ). 7. **Ensure Equal Sides**: - If both ( b_1 ) in ( P_1 ) and ( b_2 ) in ( P_2 ) overlap with ( d ), then ( a_1 ) in ( P_1 ) and ( a_2 ) in ( P_2 ) are both different sides of ( P ) but each is equal to ( d ): [ text{If } a_1 = d text{ and } a_2 = d, text{ then } a_1 text{ and } a_2 text{ are equal sides in } P. ] 8. **Conclusion**: - This completes the proof by induction that any convex polygon divided into isosceles triangles by non-intersecting diagonals must have at least two sides that are equal.

B: There exists a real number m such that line l and circle C have no common points. C: If circle C has exactly three common tangent lines with the curve x^2 + y^2 2x + 8y + a = 0, then a=8. D: When m=1, the equation of the circle symmetric to circle C with respect to line l is x^2 + (y2)^2 = 4.","completion":"To analyze the given problem, we proceed step by step, closely following the provided solution. **Step 1: Analyzing Option A** Given circle C: (x+2)^2 + y^2 = 4, we identify its center as (-2, 0) and its radius r = 2. For m=0, line l becomes l: x + 2y - 1 = 0. The distance d from the center of the circle to this line is calculated using the formula d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}, where (x_0, y_0) is the center of the circle, and Ax + By + C = 0 is the equation of the line. Substituting the values, we get: [d = frac{|-2 - 1|}{sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = frac{3}{sqrt{5}} = frac{3sqrt{5}}{5}] Since the distance from the center to the line is frac{3sqrt{5}}{5}, and the radius of the circle is 2, the difference 2 - frac{3sqrt{5}}{5} does not equal 1. Therefore, there cannot be exactly three points on circle C that are at a distance of 1 from line l. Hence, option A is incorrect. **Step 2: Analyzing Option B** For any value of m, the line l can be rewritten in a form that does not depend on m for the purpose of finding a point it passes through. Solving the system left{begin{array}{l}{x+1=0}{x+2y-1=0}end{array}right. yields left{begin{array}{l}{x=-1}{y=1}end{array}right., indicating that line l passes through point (-1, 1), which is inside circle C. Thus, line l always intersects circle C at two points, making option B incorrect. **Step 3: Analyzing Option C** Given the condition for exactly three common tangent lines, we infer that the circles are externally tangent. The given curve can be rewritten as a circle: left(x-1right)^2 + left(y+4right)^2 = 17-a. The distance between the centers of the two circles is sqrt{(-2-1)^2+(0+4)^2} = 5. For the circles to be externally tangent, their radii's sum must equal the distance between their centers: [sqrt{17-a} + 2 = 5] Solving for a, we find a = 8. Therefore, option C is correct. **Step 4: Analyzing Option D** When m=1, line l becomes l: x + y = 0. The center of circle C is (-2, 0), and the symmetric point of the center with respect to line l is (0, 2). Thus, the equation of the circle symmetric to circle C with respect to line l is x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 4, making option D correct. **Conclusion** The correct options are C and D, encapsulated as boxed{C text{ and } D}. **Analysis** This problem required understanding the relationships between lines and circles, including distances, intersections, and symmetry, at a medium level of difficulty."},{"prompt":"A supermarket has 6 checkout lanes, each with two checkout points numbered 1 and 2.

Let's transform the equation using the properties of sine and the behavior of sums of sine functions at multiples of an angle: 3. We start by examining the sum: [ sin x+sin left(x+frac{2 pi}{7}right)+ldots+sin left(x+6 cdot frac{2 pi}{7}right)=0 ] This can be recognized as the sum of sines of angles distributed uniformly around the unit circle, spaced at intervals of (frac{2pi}{7}). 4.

A line l passing through point P intersects the circle at points A and B. The point C is chosen on segment AB such that PA cdot PB = PC^2. Points M and N are the midpoints of the two arcs into which chord AB divides the circle Omega. We need to prove that the measure of the angle angle MCN does not depend on the choice of line l. 1. **Tangent Segments from Point P:** Draw the tangent segments PK and PL from point P to the circle Omega (where K and L are the points of tangency). By the Power of a Point Theorem, we know: [ PK^2 = PL^2 = PA cdot PB = PC^2 ] Hence: [ PK = PL = PC ] This implies that points K, L, and C lie on a circle centered at P with radius PK (or PL). 2. **Location of Points M and N:** Note that M and N are defined as the midpoints of the arcs AB that do not include AB. Therefore, they are the points where the internal tangents to Omega intersect with AB. By definition, M and N are equidistant from A and B. 3. **Bisection of Angles and Arcs:** The line passing through K and C intersects the circle Omega again at M' (other than K). Since P is outside, the angle angle PKA is defined as alpha and angle PCK = angle PKC = beta. Therefore: [ angle AKP = alpha ] [ angle AKC = beta - alpha ] Similarly: [ angle BKC = beta - alpha ] This means line KC bisects angle BKA, and thus intersects the arc AB at its midpoint M. Similarly, line LC intersects the arc AB at midpoint N. 4. **Calculation of Angle angle MCN:** Since M and N are the midpoints of the arcs AB, the angle angle MKN subtended by them at the center of the circle Omega is half the circumference minus the angle angle KPL. Hence: [ angle MKN = frac{1}{2}(360^circ - angle KPL) ] Thus, the measure of the angle angle MCN is determined solely by the circle's constants and the configuration of P, A, B, and does not depend on the specific choice of the line l.

The slope of the first line is a, and the slope of the second line is frac{1}{a}. For lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal, which gives us the equation a = frac{1}{a}. Solving this equation yields a^2 = 1, so a = pm 1. When a=1, the lines become x-y+1=0 and x-y-2=0, which are indeed parallel. When a=-1, the lines become x+y+1=0 and x+y-2=0, which are also parallel. Therefore, \\"a=1\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the lines to be parallel, making statement A incorrect. For statement B: To find the range of the slope of line l that passes through P(1,0) and intersects the line segment AB, we calculate the slopes of PA and PB. The slope of PA is k_{PA} = frac{1-0}{2-1} = 1, which corresponds to an angle of frac{pi}{4}. The slope of PB is k_{PB} = frac{2sqrt{3}-0}{-1-1} = -sqrt{3}, which corresponds to an angle of frac{2pi}{3}. Therefore, the range of the slope of line l is [frac{pi}{4},frac{2pi}{3}], making statement B correct. For statement C: Circle C_{1} can be rewritten as (x+1)^{2}+y^{2}=1, with center (-1,0) and radius 1. Circle C_{2} can be rewritten as (x-2)^{2}+(y-4)^{2}=20-m, with center (2,4). The distance between the centers |C_{1}C_{2}| is sqrt{(-1-2)^2+(0-4)^2} = sqrt{9+16} = 5. For the circles to have exactly four common tangents, they must be externally tangent, which implies 5 > 1 + sqrt{20-m}. Solving this inequality gives 4 < m < 20, making statement C correct. For statement D: The circle x^{2}+y^{2}=2 has center (0,0) and radius sqrt{2}. The distance from the center to the line x-y+1=0 is given by frac{|0-0+1|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. This distance equals the radius minus frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, implying that there are points on the circle exactly at this distance from the line. However, the correct interpretation should lead to the realization that there are not exactly two such points, making statement D incorrect.

Since the sine function sin y = sin z if and only if y = z + 2kpi or y = pi - z + 2kpi, for some integer k, we can consider the expression in terms of S(x) = sin x - x. Since sin x approximates as x when x is near 0, and considering the limit of sin x as x approaches pi/2 is 1, we expect S(x) to be close to 0 near x = 0 and near x = pi/2. Analyzing the change, for x in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], sin x is strictly increasing, but at a rate slower than linear due to the concavity of cosine. Therefore, S(x) is decreasing. Calculate S(x) for the limit of the interval: [ S(sin^{-1} 0.9) = sin(sin^{-1} 0.9) - sin^{-1} 0.9 = 0.9 - sin^{-1} 0.9 ] Estimate sin^{-1} 0.9 approx 1.119, thus S(sin^{-1} 0.9) approx 0.9 - 1.119 = -0.219. The key question is how many times does sin x = x within the interval 0 to sin^{-1} 0.9. As sin x > x for 0 < x < sin^{-1} 0.9, there is only one point where sin x = x, which is x = 0.

We can calculate the cost per unit for each type of truck: - For a Type A truck, the cost per unit is 400 yuan / 20 units = 20 yuan per unit. - For a Type B truck, the cost per unit is 300 yuan / 10 units = 30 yuan per unit. Since the cost per unit is lower for Type A trucks, we should use all four Type A trucks first. Each Type A truck can carry 20 units, so the four trucks together can carry 4 trucks × 20 units/truck = 80 units. After using the Type A trucks, we still need to transport 100 units - 80 units = 20 units. To transport these remaining units, we need to use Type B trucks. Since each Type B truck carries 10 units, and we have 20 units left to transport, we will need 20 units / 10 units/truck = 2 Type B trucks.

We need to show that there always exists at least one line (row or column) in the grid that does not cross through any domino. 2. **Count of Squares and Dominoes**: A 6 times 6 grid consists of 36 squares. Since each domino covers 2 squares, placing 18 dominoes will cover exactly 18 cdot 2 = 36 squares. Hence, the grid is entirely covered by the dominoes. 3. **Grid Lines and Domino Crossings**: In a 6 times 6 grid, there are 6 rows and 6 columns, resulting in a total of 6 + 6 = 12 possible grid lines that run from one side of the grid to the other. 4. **Domino Coverage and Grid Line Crossings**: Each domino can be placed either horizontally or vertically, and each will \\"cross\\" one grid line (either a row or a column, but not both). Thus, for 18 dominoes, there would be 18 grid line crossings. 5. **Minimum Crossings Calculation**: Consider each grid line. If a line divides the squares into two parts, each part contains an odd number of squares since 6 is even. Thus, any such line must pass through at least one domino to maintain the coverage. 6. **Lines and Required Crossings**: If each of the 12 grid lines (6 rows and 6 columns) crossed at least one domino, then there would need to be at least 12 dominoes being crossed by a line at least once. 7. **Contradiction in Count**: However, if each domino is crossed by a line, then a minimum of 20 domino crossings are required since each line must cross two squares (1 line * 2 parts = 2 crossings per line). But we only have 18 dominoes, indicating there cannot be enough crossings. 8. **Logical Conclusion**: Since we run into a contradiction with the counting (as only 18 dominoes cannot fulfill 20 crossings), it implies the initial assumption that each grid line crosses at least one domino must be false. Consequently, there will always be at least one grid line (row or column) that does not cross any domino. Conclusively, no matter how the 18 dominoes are placed within the 6 times 6 grid, there will always be at least one line that does not cross any domino, proving the existence of a \\"crack\\" in the grid. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"a high school chemistry test, the average score of 50 students in a class was 82, with a variance of 8.2.

( ) A: 60 B: 70 C: 80 D: 100","completion":"To approach this problem, we start by understanding the meaning of average and variance. The average score is 82, which means that the sum of all scores divided by the number of students, which is 50, results in 82. The variance is a measure of how spread out the scores are from the average. A variance of 8.2 suggests that the scores are distributed around the average with a certain amount of variability. Now, to determine which of the provided scores could not possibly be one of the chemistry scores, we need to look at the likely range of scores given the variance. Each individual score contributes to the variance, and extremely high or low scores would affect the variance more significantly. If a number is very far away from the mean, it becomes less likely to happen given a small variance. Given the options provided, let's consider each one: A: 60 - This score is 22 points below the average. B: 70 - This score is 12 points below the average. C: 80 - This score is 2 points below the average. D: 100 - This score is 18 points above the average. While it is theoretically possible for the score to be more than 22 points away from the average, it is unlikely given the small variance of 8.2. Scores closer to the mean are more likely to occur because they contribute less to the variance. Thus, a score of 60 is the least likely to occur and may not be a possible score in this set given the low variance.

Our task is to show that ( H = S ). 2. **Initial Observation**: Clearly, ( K subseteq H ). Additionally, due to the construction, ( H ) is symmetric with respect to each line containing the sides of ( K ). 3. **Symmetry Consideration**: Let ( mathcal{E} ) be the set of reflection axes of ( H ). If ( t_1, t_2 in mathcal{E} ) and ( t_1^prime ) is the reflection of ( t_1 ) across ( t_2 ), then ( t_1^prime in mathcal{E} ). Consequently, ( H ) is symmetric with respect to any line that can be obtained by reflecting a symmetry axis of ( H ) about another symmetry axis of ( H ). 4. **Reflection Property**: Since ( K subseteq H ), any image ( K^{prime} ) of ( K ) obtained by a sequence of reflections across lines in ( mathcal{E} ) is also in ( H ).

A circular sector reflected across one of its bounding radius lines remains in ( H ), since ( H ) is symmetric. Repeated reflections of a circular sector generated in this way also remain in ( H ). 7. **Union Construction**: Consider the union ( K^* ) consisting of ( K ), circles of radius ( R ) centered at the vertices of ( K ), and all images of ( K ) obtained by reflections across lines containing the sides of ( K ). Choose ( r > 0 ) such that ( K^r subseteq K^* ).

Define the distance between two vertices of a cube as the minimum number of edges that must be traversed to get from one vertex to another. It is evident that this distance is at most 3 for any two vertices: - The maximum distance is 3 edges since you can travel from one corner of a cube to the opposite corner in at most 3 edges. 3. Now, let's consider the specific path from vertex labeled 1 to vertex labeled 8. We can travel from vertex 1 to vertex 8 using a sequence of at most 3 edges. 4. We need to check if there is an edge between two vertices such that the difference in their labels is at least 3. 5. Assume, without loss of generality, that the vertices labeled (a) and (b) are connected by an edge. - We aim to prove that (|a - b| geq 3). 6. Note that a cube has 12 edges, and if we move from one vertex to an adjacent vertex (connected by an edge) the movement changes the number by 1 or 2 in the worst case scenario since vertices distance doesn't create cyclomatic complexity like a complete graph. 7. However, because the path from 1 to 8 must cover multiple edges, considering the nodes at either end of an edge will show a greater difference by the necessity implied by the max edge traversal: - Consider this traversal: 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and continuing until 8. The difference between highest and lowest (1 and 8) is 7. Now, any movement in such sequences consistent between sets of 3 will create a min. difference of 3. Setting labels appropriately implies any edge must validate that criteria because total sum-difference rule contained within valid numeric label operations per node constraints. 8. Since moving within 3 edges in any permissible cube arrangement ensures label difference consistent coverage, resulting: - When labeling each edge validation through interconnecting nodes sequential difference ≥3 inherently holds truth. 9. This configuration thus ensures it guaranteed from necessary constraints evaluating without fail on edge configuration throughout cube: - Hence proved, among edges connecting vertices always existing edge differences not ≤3 minimum difference this cube labeling scheme supports. Conclusion: There is always an edge in the cube whose vertices have labels that differ by at least 3. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Three fair, sixsided dice are rolled.

Based on the given information about the chords, we have two equations from the perpendicular bisector theorem (the distance from the center to the chord is equal to the radius): For the chord of length 4 on the x-axis, the midpoint of the chord lies at (2,0), so the distance to the center should equal the radius of the circle. Thus, R^2 = (a - 2)^2 + (2a - 0)^2. For the chord of length 8 on the y-axis, the midpoint of the chord is (0,4), so we also have R^2 = (a - 0)^2 + (2a - 4)^2. Solving the first equation for R^2, we get R^2 = a^2 - 4a + 4 + 4a^2 = 5a^2 - 4a + 4. Solving the second equation for R^2, we get R^2 = a^2 + 4a^2 - 16a + 16 = 5a^2 - 16a + 16. Since both expressions are equal to R^2, we set them equal to each other: 5a^2 - 4a + 4 = 5a^2 - 16a + 16. Simplifying this, we obtain -4a + 4 = -16a + 16. Solving for a, we get 12a = 12, which gives a = 1. Now, knowing a = 1, we can calculate the radius using either equation for R^2. We'll use the first one: R^2 = (1 - 2)^2 + (2 cdot 1 - 0)^2. R^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2. R^2 = 1 + 4. R^2 = 5. Therefore, the radius of the circle R is sqrt{5}. Since the center is at (1, 2a) or (1, 2), the equation of the circle is: (x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 5.

However, the correct equation does not involve adding the distances together but equating the distance covered by the good horse to the total distance covered by the slow horse (including its head start).

For x neq 0, prove by mathematical induction: (i) When m=1, the original inequality holds; When m=2, the left side equals 1+2x+x^2, the right side equals 1+2x, Since x^2 geq 0, the left side is greater than or equal to the right side, so the original inequality holds; (ii) Assume when m=k, the inequality holds, i.e., (1+x)^k geq 1+kx, Then when m=k+1, since x > -1, Therefore 1+x > 0, multiplying both sides of the inequality (1+x)^k geq 1+kx by 1+x yields (1+x)^k cdot (1+x) geq (1+kx)(1+x) = 1+(k+1)x+kx^2 geq 1+(k+1)x, Thus, (1+x)^{k+1} geq 1+(k+1)x. Hence, when m=k+1, the inequality also holds. Combining (i) and (ii), we know that the inequality holds for all positive integers m. (II) Proof: When n geq 6, m leq n, from (I) we have (1- frac {1}{n+3})^{m} geq 1- frac {m}{n+3} > 0, Thus, (1- frac {m}{n+3})^{n} leq (1- frac {1}{n+3})^{nm} = [(1- frac {1}{n+3})^{n}]^{m} < (frac {1}{2})^{m}, for m=1,2,ldots,n.

In conclusion, the only n that satisfies the equation are boxed{n=2,3}. Solution 2: (I) Proof: When x=0 or m=1, the equality in the original inequality obviously holds.

(i) When m=2, the left side equals 1+2x+x^2, the right side equals 1+2x, since x neq 0, x^2 > 0, thus the left side is greater than the right side, and inequality holds; (ii) Assume when m=k(k geq 2), the inequality holds, i.e., (1+x)^k > 1+kx, then when m=k+1, since x > -1, 1+x > 0. Also, since x neq 0, k geq 2, kx^2 > 0. Thus, multiplying both sides of the inequality (1+x)^k > 1+kx by 1+x yields (1+x)^k cdot (1+x) > (1+kx)(1+x) = 1+(k+1)x+kx^2 > 1+(k+1)x, Therefore, (1+x)^{k+1} > 1+(k+1)x. Hence, when m=k+1, the inequality also holds. In conclusion, the proven inequality holds. (II) Proof: When n geq 6, m leq n, since (1- frac {1}{n+3})^{n} < frac {1}{2}, Therefore, [(1- frac {1}{n+3})^{m}]^{n} < (frac {1}{2})^{m}, And from (I), (1- frac {1}{n+3})^{m} geq 1- frac {m}{n+3} > 0, Therefore, (1- frac {m}{n+3})^{n} leq [(1- frac {1}{n+3})^{m}]^{n} < (frac {1}{2})^{m}. (III) Solution: Assume there exists a positive integer n_0 geq 6 such that the equation 3^{n_0}+4^{n_0}+ldots+(n_0+2)^{n_0}=(n_0+3)^{n_0} holds, That is, (frac {3}{n_0+3})^{n_0}+(frac {4}{n_0+3})^{n_0}+ldots+(frac {n_0+2}{n_0+3})^{n_0}=1.

We are given that for every pair ((xi, eta)) of integers, not both divisible by ( p ), the values ( l_k(xi, eta) ) for ( 1 leq k leq p^2 ) represent every residue class modulo ( p ) exactly ( p ) times. We need to prove that the set of pairs ({(a_k, b_k) : 1 leq k leq p^2}) is identical modulo ( p ) with the set ({(m, n) : 0 leq m, n leq p-1}). 2. **Establish the uniformity condition:** The uniformity of representations implies that for every ((xi, eta) notequiv (0, 0) pmod{p}), we have: [ sum_{k=1}^{p^2} e^{frac{2 pi i}{p}(a_k xi + b_k eta)} = 0. ] 3. **Multiply by an exponential factor:** Multiply both sides by ( e^{frac{2 pi i}{p} (u xi + v eta)} ) to get: [ sum_{k=1}^{p^2} e^{frac{2 pi i}{p}((a_k - u) xi + (b_k - v) eta)} = 0, ] for ((xi, eta) notequiv (0, 0) pmod{p}). 4. **Consider the case (xi equiv eta equiv 0 pmod{p}):** For (xi equiv eta equiv 0 pmod{p}), the same sum obviously gives ( p^2 ).

To achieve this transformation, consider each pair of different letters ((I, M), (I, O), (M, O)).

Initially, all ( I )'s precede all ( O )'s in ( A ), but in ( B ), all ( O )'s must precede all ( I )'s. Therefore, each ( I ) needs to swap with each ( O ) at least once. Since there are ( n ) ( I )'s and ( n ) ( O )'s, this constitutes ( n^2 ) swaps. - For each pair ((I, M)) and ((M, O)), the same logic applies: each identical letter needs to be swapped individually with every other letter of the particular pair.

Hence, the inequality transforms into: [ frac{2 sqrt{x}}{1 - x} + frac{2 sqrt{y}}{1 - y} + frac{2 sqrt{z}}{1 - z} geq 3 sqrt{3} ] 6.

Then, at the point x = 1, we have f'(1) = frac{2 - 0}{4} = frac{1}{2}, and f(1) = frac{ln 1}{1 + 1} = 0. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at the point (1, f(1)) is y - 0 = frac{1}{2}(x - 1), which simplifies to y = frac{1}{2}x - frac{1}{2}. Thus, the equation of the tangent line is x - 2y - 1 = 0. (2) (i) We are given the condition f(x) - frac{t}{x} > frac{ln x}{x - 1}. Rearranging, we have frac{ln x}{x + 1} - frac{ln x}{x - 1} - frac{t}{x} > 0. Define a function g(x) = frac{ln x}{x + 1} - frac{ln x}{x - 1} - frac{t}{x}. Differentiating g(x) with respect to x, we get g'(x) = frac{1}{1 - x^2}[2ln x + frac{t(x^2 - 1)}{x}]. Next, let h(x) = 2ln x + frac{t(x^2 - 1)}{x} and differentiate it to obtain h'(x) = frac{2}{x} + tleft(1 + frac{1}{x^2}right) = frac{tx^2 + 2x + t}{x^2}. When t geq 0, h'(x) > 0 for all x > 0, which implies that h(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). Since h(1) = 0, for x in (0, 1), h(x) < 0. However, because frac{1}{1 - x^2} > 0, this means g(x) < 0 does not satisfy the given condition. When t < 0, consider the function phi(x) = tx^2 + 2x + t. Analyzing the discriminant, we have: ① If Delta = 4 - 4t^2 leq 0, i.e., t leq -1, then phi(x) leq 0 for all x, meaning that h'(x) leq 0 for (0, +infty). This indicates h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty), and since h(1) = 0, for x in (1, +infty), we have g(x) > 0, which satisfies the condition. ② If Delta = 4 - 4t^2 > 0, meaning -1 < t < 0, the axis of symmetry for phi(x) is at x = -frac{1}{t} > 1. Therefore, phi(x) is increasing on (1, -frac{1}{t}). Thus, for x in (1, -frac{1}{t}), we have phi(x) > phi(1) = 2 + 2t > 0, hence h'(x) > 0 and h(x) increases on (1, -frac{1}{t}). Consequently, h(x) > h(1) = 0 for this interval, but since frac{1}{1 - x^2} < 0, we get g(x) < 0 in (1, -frac{1}{t}), which does not satisfy the given condition. Combining all cases, we conclude that the maximum value of t is t leq -1. Thus, the maximum value of t is boxed{-1}. (ii) Since we have established t = -1, consider the following: frac{ln x}{x + 1} - frac{ln x}{x - 1} + frac{1}{x} > 0. For x > 1, this can be rewritten as: 2ln x < x - frac{1}{x}. Letting x = frac{k}{k - 1} gives: 2ln frac{k}{k - 1} < frac{k}{k - 1} - frac{k - 1}{k} = frac{1}{k} + frac{1}{k - 1}. Summing from k = 2 to k = n yields: 2ln n < 1 + sum_{i=2}^{n}left(frac{1}{i} + frac{1}{i - 1}right), which simplifies to: 2ln n < 1 + 2left(frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{n - 1}right) + frac{1}{n}.

These circles are of equal radius and each touches two adjacent sides of the quadrilateral ( ABCD ). 2. **Connecting the geometry:** The points ( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 ) are the centers of the circles with common radius ( r ) that are inscribed within the quadrilateral. Since the circles touch the sides of the quadrilateral, this configuration creates a smaller quadrilateral ( A_1B_1C_1D_1 ) within ( ABCD ) whose sides are parallel to the respective sides of ( ABCD ). 3. **Examining angles:** As ( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 ) are the centers of the circles, ( A_1B_1C_1D_1 ) forms an inscribed quadrilateral. This means the angles of quadrilateral ( A_1B_1C_1D_1 ) are related via parallelism to the angles of quadrilateral ( ABCD ).

Let's proceed step by step. 1. **Hall's Marriage Theorem:** - This theorem states that a bipartite graph G = (A, B, E) (where E denotes edges) has a perfect matching if and only if for every subset A_1 subseteq A, the cardinality |A_1| leq |N(A_1)|. Here, N(A_1) denotes the set of all neighbors of A_1 in B. The theorem guarantees a matching that covers all vertices in A. 2. **Graph Construction:** - Suppose we have a group of scouts forming a bipartite graph G = (A, B, E), where vertices A and B each represent scouts. An edge (u, v) exists between u in A and v in B if scout u knows scout v. - Each scout knows between 50 and 100 other scouts, so every vertex in G has a degree between 50 and 100. 3. **Auxiliary Lemma:** - Let k leq n leq m be positive integers. Given a graph G where every vertex degree is no less than n and no more than m, one can remove some edges to form a new graph wherein every vertex degree is no less than n-k and no more than m-k. The proof for this lemma proceeds by iterative removal of troublesome edges and is illustrated as follows: - If two vertices share a maximum degree m, remove one of their connecting edges. Repeat this process until no such degree-sharing vertices exist. - Let A be the set of vertices of degree m, and B the set of all other vertices. Consider the subgraph with edges only between A and B. By Hall's Theorem, a perfect matching exists that pairs all vertices in A uniquely to vertices in B. - Remove the edges in this matching, reducing the degrees of all vertices in A by 1 but still keeping them between n-1 and m-1. 4. **Application for the Given Problem:** - With k = 30, n = 50, and m = 100, applying the auxiliary lemma results in a graph H where every vertex degree ranges from 20 to 70. - In H, every vertex is initially colored red. For any vertex x, there exist 20 neighboring vertices, forming N(x). We connect all pairs in N(x) with green edges. 5. **Vertex Coloring with 1331 Colors:** - Consider a collection of vertices sum_{x in H} N(x) with a graph H' formed solely by green edges. Each vertex in H' has a degree of no more than 70 cdot 19 = 1330 because each vertex connects to at most 70 neighbors, each connected to 19 others. - By using at most 1331 different colors, we can color H' such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 6. **Final Coloring Scheme:** - Color the vertices in G setminus H' (vertices not in H') with any of the 1331 colors since they are not adjacent. This ensures that each vertex has at least 20 uniquely colored adjacent vertices. Therefore, it is possible to assign each scout a hat of one of many different colors, with the total number of colors not exceeding 1331, such that for every scout, at least 20 of the people they know (adjacent vertices) have uniquely different colored hats.

Since b > c and B = 60^circ, it follows that C < B, meaning that C is an acute angle, and thus C = 30^circ. Given that the angles in a triangle add up to 180^circ, we have A = 180^circ - B - C = 90^circ. Using the Pythagorean theorem, a = sqrt{b^2 + c^2} = 2. Therefore, we have: boxed{a = 2, B = 60^circ, C = 30^circ}.

The value sin C = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} corresponds to C = 60^circ or C = 120^circ, since the sine function has two positive results in the range of 0^circ to 180^circ.

The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. In our case, the point is the center of the circle (0,2) and the line equation is mx - y - 3m - 1 = 0.

Notice that the term m + frac{1}{m}, which is part of the above expression when expanded, is subject to the inequality m^2 + frac{1}{m^2} geq 2, by the AM-GM inequality.

The standard equation of a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.

Speed of the train = 60 km/hour 1 kilometer = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, to convert 60 km/h to m/s: 60 km/h * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 60 * 1000 / 3600 m/s = 60000 / 3600 m/s = 16.67 m/s (approximately) Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 1200 meters / 16.67 m/s Time ≈ 71.98 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{72} seconds for the train to pass the bridge."},{"prompt":"The expression (frac{a^{2}}{a^{5}} times frac{4 a}{left(2^{1} aright)^{3}}) where (a neq 0), is equal to: (a) (frac{a^{3}}{2}) (b) (frac{2}{a^{3}}) (c) (frac{1}{2 a^{3}}) (d) (frac{a^{5}}{2}) (e) (frac{2}{a^{5}})","completion":"Given the expression: [ frac{a^{-2}}{a^{5}} times frac{4 a}{left(2^{-1} aright)^{-3}} ] 1.

Since 20% of the votes polled were invalid, the remaining 80% were valid. Total valid votes = 80% of 5720 = 0.80 * 5720 = 4576 We know that candidate B got 1859 valid votes. To find out how many valid votes candidate A got, we subtract B's valid votes from the total valid votes: Valid votes for A = Total valid votes - Valid votes for B = 4576 - 1859 = 2717 Now, we need to find the percentage by which A's valid votes exceeded B's valid votes. To do this, we calculate the difference between A's and B's votes and then divide by B's votes and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Percentage by which A's votes exceeded B's = [(Valid votes for A - Valid votes for B) / Valid votes for B] * 100 = [(2717 - 1859) / 1859] * 100 = (858 / 1859) * 100 ≈ 46.15% Therefore, A's valid votes exceeded B's valid votes by approximately boxed{46.15%} ."},{"prompt":"Prove that the expression (x^{5} 4x^{4}y 5y^{2}x^{3} + 20y^{3}x^{2} + 4y^{4}x 16y^{5} ) is not equal to 77 for any integer values of (x) and (y).","completion":"The given expression is: [ P(x, y) = x^5 - 4 x^4 y - 5 y^2 x^3 + 20 y^3 x^2 + 4 y^4 x - 16 y^5 ] We need to prove that this expression is never equal to 77 for any integer values of (x) and (y). 1. **Factor the Expression:** The expression can be factored as follows: [ P(x, y) = x^4(x - 4y) - 5 x^2 y^2 (x - 4y) + 4 y^4 (x - 4y) ] Notice that ( (x - 4y) ) is a common factor: [ P(x, y) = (x - 4y) left( x^4 - 5 x^2 y^2 + 4 y^4 right) ] Now, factorize ( x^4 - 5 x^2 y^2 + 4 y^4 ): [ x^4 - 5 x^2 y^2 + 4 y^4 = (x^2 - y^2)(x^2 - 4 y^2) = (x - y)(x + y)(x - 2y)(x + 2y) ] So, the expression (P(x, y)) becomes: [ P(x, y) = (x - 4y)(x - y)(x + y)(x - 2y)(x + 2y) ] 2. **Set Up the Product:** The expression (P(x, y) = (x - 4y)(x - y)(x + y)(x - 2y)(x + 2y)) must be checked if it ever equals 77. Since 77 can be factored into products of integers, let's check the possible products. 3. **Prime Factorization of 77:** [ 77 = 7 times 11 ] Additionally, 77 can be represented as the product of up to 5 integers, allowing non-strict factors like (1 cdot (-1) cdot 7 cdot (-11)). 4. **Checking Integer Factors:** Each factor ( (x - 4y), (x - y), (x + y), (x - 2y), (x + 2y) ) must be an integer. Now we need to check if these can be product combinations of integer factors of 77. 5. **Analysis of Distinctness:** The factors must all be distinct integers because (x) and (y) are integers. Specifically, for instance: [ (x - 4y), (x - y), (x + y), (x - 2y), (x + 2y) ] These terms must satisfy the relations proposed. For distinct integer solutions, choose (y = 0): [ P(x, 0) = x^5 ] And (x^5 = 77). However, for any integer (x), (x^5) is either much larger than or less than 77 for values except (x). Thus, ( x^{5} neq 77 ) for any integer (x) or (y). # Conclusion Since the product of the distinct integers ( (x - 4y), (x - y), (x + y), (x - 2y), (x + 2y) ) cannot equate to 77, we thus conclude that [ boxed{P(x, y) neq 77 text{ for all integer values of } x text{ and } y}. ]"},{"prompt":"w many different fourletter arrangements can be formed using the six letters A, B, C, D, E and F, if the first letter must be C, one of the other letters must be B, and no letter can be used more than once in the arrangement?","completion":"To solve this problem, we follow a step-by-step approach based on the conditions given: 1. **First Letter Condition**: The first letter of the arrangement must be C.

Each of the 50 cities is connected to 5 other cities. Therefore, the total number of connections (or edges, in graph theory) is ( 50 cdot 5 ). 2. Each connection involves two cities, so we must divide the product by 2 to avoid double-counting. Hence, [ text{Total number of airlines} = frac{50 times 5}{2} = 125 ] **Part (c)**: Determine if a country with exactly 46 airline routes can exist. 1. Assume there are ( n ) cities, each connecting to exactly 5 other cities. So, the total number of airline routes should be (frac{5n}{2}). 2. We set up the equation: [ frac{5n}{2} = 46 ] 3. Solving for ( n ): [ 5n = 92 n = frac{92}{5} n = 18.4 ] Since the number of cities ( n ) must be an integer, and (frac{92}{5}) is not an integer, it is impossible to have a country with exactly 46 airline routes where each city is connected to exactly 5 other cities. **Conclusion**: - **Part (b)** yields ( boxed{125} ) airline connections. - **Part (c)** confirms that a country with exactly 46 airline routes cannot exist ( boxed{text{cannot exist}} )."},{"prompt":"the sequence {a_n}, a_1=1, a_n= frac {n^{2}}{n^{2}1}a_{n1}(ngeqslant 2,ninmathbb{N}^{*}), then the sum of the first n terms of the sequence { frac {a_n}{n^{2}}} is T_n= ______.","completion":"Given the sequence {a_n} with a_1=1 and a_n= frac {n^{2}}{n^{2}-1}a_{n-1}(ngeqslant 2,ninmathbb{N}^{*}), we can derive that frac{a_n}{n} = frac{n}{n+1} cdot frac{a_{n-1}}{n-1}.

Since ( h(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial, it can take at most 3 distinct values (as a quadratic polynomial can have at most 2 distinct roots, and thus can map at most 2 different ( x )-values to the same ( y )-value). 4. **Cardinality of (mathcal{S})**: Since ( f(g(x)) ) is a quadratic polynomial, it can have at most 4 distinct roots. Therefore, ( |mathcal{S}| leq 4 ). 5. **Possible values of ( h(x) )**: Since ( h(x) ) is quadratic, it can map at most 2 different ( x )-values to the same ( y )-value.

For example, we can assume: [ h(1) = h(8), quad h(2) = h(7), quad h(3) = h(6), quad h(4) = h(5) ] 6. **Values of ( g(h(x)) )**: Since ( f(x) ) is quadratic, ( g(h(x)) ) must also take at most 2 distinct values.

Let's start by calculating how many 4\\" pieces we can fit along one side of the 100\\" cake: 100\\" / 4\\" = 25 pieces Since the cake is square, we can fit 25 pieces along both the length and the width, giving us: 25 pieces * 25 pieces = 625 pieces However, we need to ensure that after each cut, the remaining piece has even dimensions.

However, the solution assumes the equation of line l is x - 2y + lambda = 0, which is incorrect based on the slope discussion. The correct approach is to assume the slope of line l is frac{1}{2}, leading to an equation of the form y - frac{1}{2}x = lambda. Substituting point P(3,4) to find lambda is the correct step, but the initial assumption about the equation form was mistaken. Given the correct approach, let's correct the process: Assuming line l has a slope of frac{1}{2}, its equation can be written as y = frac{1}{2}x + b. Substituting P(3,4) into this equation to find b: [ 4 = frac{1}{2}(3) + b b = 4 - frac{3}{2} b = frac{8 - 3}{2} b = frac{5}{2} ] Thus, the correct equation of line l should be y = frac{1}{2}x + frac{5}{2}, or after rearranging, 2y - x = 5. Part 2: Finding the Equation of Line l with Equal Coordinate Axes Intercepts 1. **When Line l Passes Through the Origin** The equation of line l is given as y = frac{4}{3}x, which can also be written as 4x - 3y = 0. 2. **When Line l Does Not Pass Through the Origin** Assuming the equation of line l is frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{a} = 1, and substituting point P(3,4) into it, we get: [ frac{3}{a} + frac{4}{a} = 1 frac{7}{a} = 1 a = 7 ] Therefore, the equation of line l is frac{x}{7} + frac{y}{7} = 1, which simplifies to x + y - 7 = 0.
