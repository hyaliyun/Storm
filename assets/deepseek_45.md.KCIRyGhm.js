Therefore, the total number of intersection points (vertices (V)) can be calculated by choosing 2 circles from (n) and noting that each pair provides 2 vertices. Thus: [ V = binom{n}{2} times 2 = n(n-1) ] 3. **Counting Edges (E)**: Each vertex is where two circles intersect, and each such intersection contributes 2 edges (the intersecting circles split each other into arcs). Thus, given each vertex is of degree 4 (each intersection splits into 4 edges under proper consideration), the total number of edges (E) can simply be considered as: [ E = 2V = 2n(n-1) ] 4. **Calculating Faces (F)**: By Euler's formula mentioned above: [ F = E - V + 2 ] Substituting the expressions we derived for (E) and (V): [ F = 2n(n-1) - n(n-1) + 2 ] Simplifying the expression: [ F = n(n-1) + 2 ] Therefore, the number of regions the (n) great circles divide the sphere into is: [ F = n^2 - n + 2 ] 5. **Verification for Base Case (n = 1)**: Consider a single great circle (when ( n = 1 )): - It clearly divides the sphere into (2) regions. - Checking the formula: [ F = 1^2 - 1 + 2 = 2 ] Thus, the formula holds true. 6. **Conclusion**: The number of regions that (n) great circles divide the sphere into is indeed: [ boxed{n^2 - n + 2} ]"},{"prompt":"Let b be a real number randomly selected from the interval [20,20].

Denote by S the locus of points P in the interior of NIMO such that angle MPO cong angle NPO . Find the greatest integer not exceeding the perimeter of S . *Proposed by Evan Chen*","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a rhombus (NIMO) with (MN = 150sqrt{3}) and (angle MON = 60^circ). We need to find the locus of points (P) inside the rhombus such that (angle MPO = angle NPO). 2. **Using the Law of Sines:** By the Law of Sines in (triangle MOP) and (triangle NOP), we have: [ frac{OP}{sin angle PMO} = frac{MO}{sin angle MPO} = frac{NO}{sin angle NPO} = frac{OP}{sin angle PNO} ] This implies: [ sin angle PNO = sin angle PMO ] Therefore, (angle PNO) and (angle PMO) are either congruent or supplementary. 3. **Case 1: Congruent Angles:** If (angle PNO = angle PMO), then by AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) congruence, (triangle MOP cong triangle NOP). This implies that (P) lies on the angle bisector of (angle MON), which is the line (OI) where (I) is the intersection of the diagonals of the rhombus. 4. **Case 2: Supplementary Angles:** If (angle PNO + angle PMO = 180^circ), then (MONP) is a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, (P) lies on the minor arc (MN) of the circumcircle of (triangle MON). 5. **Combining the Loci:** The locus (S) of points (P) is the union of the line segment (OI) and the minor arc (MN) of the circumcircle of (triangle MON). 6. **Calculating the Perimeter:** - The length of the line segment (OI) is the distance between (O) and the midpoint of (MN). Since (MN = 150sqrt{3}) and (angle MON = 60^circ), the diagonals of the rhombus bisect each other at right angles. The length of each diagonal is (MN) and (MO), where (MO = NO = 150sqrt{3}). - The minor arc (MN) is part of the circumcircle of (triangle MON). The radius (R) of this circumcircle can be found using the formula for the circumradius of a triangle: [ R = frac{a}{2sin A} = frac{150sqrt{3}}{2sin 60^circ} = frac{150sqrt{3}}{2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = 150 ] - The length of the minor arc (MN) is (frac{1}{3}) of the circumference of the circle with radius 150: [ text{Arc length} = frac{1}{3} times 2pi times 150 = 100pi ] 7. **Summing the Perimeter:** The total perimeter of (S) is the sum of the length of (OI) and the minor arc (MN): [ text{Perimeter} = 150 + 100pi ] 8. **Greatest Integer Not Exceeding the Perimeter:** We need to find the greatest integer not exceeding (150 + 100pi).

In this triangle: - Side (AC'=AC') remains the same. - Side (AB'' = AB') because it is the length of the segment rotated. - The angle between (AC') and (AB'') is more than 60 degrees since the angle (C'A B') is more than 120 degrees by the given condition. 3.

Now, multiply the entire sum by 2: 2T_n = 2^2 + 2 cdot 2^3 + 3 cdot 2^4 + ldots + (n-1) cdot 2^n + n cdot 2^{n+1}. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: -T_n = 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ldots + 2^n - n cdot 2^{n+1}. This is a geometric series that can be summed: -T_n = 2 times frac{1-2^n}{1-2} - n times 2^{n+1} = 2^{n+1} - 2 - n times 2^{n+1}. Hence, T_n = (n-1) cdot 2^{n+1} + 2. So we can express the final answer as: boxed{T_n = (n-1) cdot 2^{n+1} + 2}"},{"prompt":"An automobile assembly plant performs the following 8 tasks on each car that is produced: install the engine, add axles, add wheels to the axles, install the windshield, install the instrument panel, install the steering wheel, mount the doors, and install the interior seating.

We aim to determine the minimum number of weighings, ( k ), required to identify the two false coins. 1. **Label the Coins:** Let the coins be labeled as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{2022} ). 2. **Define the Weighing Process:** Define ( W_n ) as the weighing process of a set of coins from coin ( a_n ) to ( a_{n+673} ). This means each weighing process ( W_n ) involves 674 coins. 3. **Analyze the Parity:** We need to prove that no matter the placement of the false coins, there are always ( W_i ) and ( W_j ) where ( i neq j ) and both have different parities. Assume otherwise, that all ( W_n ) have the same parity. 4. **Contradiction Argument:** If all ( W_n ) have the same parity, then for ( 1 leq n leq 674 ), the coins ( a_n, a_{n+674}, ) and ( a_{n+1348} ) must have the same parity.

A quarter is the same as 1/4, and a fifth is the same as 1/5. To find out how many fifths are in a quarter, we can set up a proportion: 1/5 : 4 hours = 1/4 : x hours To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: (1/5) * x = (1/4) * 4 x = (1/4) * 4 / (1/5) x = (1 * 4) / (1/4 * 5) x = 4 / (1/20) x = 4 * 20 x = 80 So, it would take the crow 80 hours to eat a quarter of the nuts if it eats at the same rate as it does for a fifth of the nuts. However, this calculation seems to be incorrect because it implies that eating a smaller portion (a quarter) would take much longer than eating a larger portion (a fifth). Let's correct this. To find the correct proportion, we should compare the fractions directly: 1/5 of the nuts is eaten in 4 hours. 1/4 of the nuts is the goal. Since 1/4 is larger than 1/5, it should take less time to eat 1/4 than it does to eat 1/5. We can find the common denominator to compare these two fractions: The common denominator of 4 and 5 is 20. So we convert the fractions: 1/5 = 4/20 1/4 = 5/20 Now we can see that 1/4 is just one more twentieth than 1/5. Since it takes 4 hours to eat 1/5 (or 4/20), it will take 1/5 of 4 hours to eat one more twentieth to make it 1/4 (or 5/20). 1/5 of 4 hours is: 4 hours / 5 = 0.8 hours So, to eat a quarter of the nuts, the crow will take 4 hours plus 0.8 hours, which is: 4 + 0.8 = 4.8 hours Therefore, it will take the crow boxed{4.8} hours in total to finish a quarter of the nuts."},{"prompt":"the sequence left{a_{n}right}, a_{1}=1.

Divide the second equation by the first equation: [ frac{a'b' + b'c' + c'a'}{a'b'c'} = frac{ab + bc + ca}{frac{1}{2}abc} ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ frac{a'b' + b'c' + c'a'}{a'b'c'} = frac{2(ab + bc + ca)}{abc} ] [ sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a'} = 2 sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a} ] 6. Since we are reducing the dimensions, we have (a ge a'), (b ge b'), and (c ge c'). This implies: [ sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a} le sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a'} ] 7. Combining the inequalities, we get: [ sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a} le sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a'} = 2 sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a} ] This implies: [ sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a} le 2 sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a} ] 8. The only way this inequality holds is if: [ sum_{text{cyc}} frac{1}{a} = 0 ] However, since (a, b, c) are positive dimensions, this is impossible. Therefore, our assumption that we can reduce the dimensions to get half the volume and half the surface area leads to a contradiction.

Hence, the final result is boxed{f(x) = x^3 - 3x}. (2) Setting f'(x) = 0, we find that 3x^2 - 3 = 0, which gives x = pm 1. When x in (-infty, -1), f'(x) > 0; the function f(x) is increasing on this interval. When x in (-1, 1), f'(x) < 0; the function f(x) is decreasing on this interval. Since f(-1) = 2 and f(1) = -2, For x in [-2, 2], we have max f(x) = 2 and min f(x) = -2. Hence, for any x_1, x_2 in [-2, 2], |f(x_1) - f(x_2)| leq |f_{max} - f_{min}| = 4. Thus, c geq 4.

The equation of the tangent line then is 3x_0^2 - 3 = frac{y_0 - m}{x_0 - 2} = frac{x_0^3 - 3x_0 - m}{x_0 - 2} Rearranging, we obtain 2x_0^3 - 6x_0^2 + 6 + m = 0. Since there are three tangent lines through M(2,m), the above equation must have three distinct real roots. Let g(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 6 + m. The derivative g'(x) = 6x^2 - 12x.

For our function f(x) = x^2 + 2(a-1)x + 3, the coefficient b is 2(a-1). Plugging this into the vertex formula gives us: x = -frac{2(a-1)}{2} = 1-a. Since the parabola opens upwards and we want the function to be increasing from x=1 onwards, the vertex must be located to the left of or at x=1. Therefore, 1-a leq 1. Solving this inequality for a gives: -a leq 0, a geq 0. Thus, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval [1, +infty) when a is greater than or equal to 0.

Part (a): On the plane We'll first consider the problem when the points are situated in a plane. **Lemma**: In a triangle, if two sides are larger than 2, and the angle between them is larger than 105^circ, then the length of the third side is greater than 3. **Proof of the Lemma**: - By the Law of Cosines, for a triangle with sides a, b, and c, and angle theta between sides a and b, the third side c can be determined by: [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cdot cos(theta). ] - Let a = b = 2 and theta > 105^circ. - Knowing cos(105^circ) = -cos(75^circ) and the cosine of 75^circ is: [ cos(75^circ) = cos(45^circ + 30^circ) = cos(45^circ) cos(30^circ) - sin(45^circ) sin(30^circ) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{1}{2}= frac{sqrt{6}}{4} - frac{sqrt{2}}{4} = frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4} ] - Now, (cos(105^circ) = -cos(75^circ)) and therefore, [ cos(105^circ) = -frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4}. ] - Hence, the side length c can be approximated by: [ c^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 2 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdot cos(105^circ) = 8 + 8 cdot frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4} = 8 + 2 (sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}). ] - Since cos(105^circ) is negative and the multiplication leads to adding additional values, we will find c^2 > 12, ensuring c > 3. Thus, the length of the third side is strictly greater than 3. Using this lemma, let's consider two scenarios: 1. **Scenario 1**: The convex hull of the five points is a pentagon (ABCDE). - At least one of the internal angles of a pentagon must be geq 108^circ. - By the lemma, there is at least one side of the triangle formed, which exceeds (3). Therefore, some distance between the points is greater than (3). 2. **Scenario 2**: Convex hull is a quadrilateral or triangle. - Suppose the convex hull is a quadrilateral or a triangle, and consider a point, say (P), inside this convex hull. - Thereby, we can form triangles each having some angle > 105^circ among the internal points leading to at least one pair having a distance greater than (3) by the lemma. By exhausting all cases, we find a pair with distance (>3). **Conclusion for Part (a)**: It is true that there exists a distance greater than 3 between some two points if these 5 points are located on the plane.

Prove that ( |A| = |B| = |C| ).

Each distinct way to parenthesize the product can be viewed as a way to form nonoverlapping triangles within the hexagon. For example, if we parenthesize as (((a_1 a_2) a_3) (a_4 a_5)), we can divide the hexagon into the following triangles using diagonals: - One triangle is formed using sides corresponding to ( a_1, a_2 ), and a diagonal. - Another triangle is formed using sides corresponding to ( a_1 a_2 ) (combined), ( a_3 ), and a diagonal. - A similar process applies for the other elements. Each combination of parentheses directly translates into a unique division of the hexagon into triangles. Since this mapping is direct and reversible, we have a bijection. Conclusion: ( |A| = |B| ). 2. **Bijection between (A) and (C)**: We transform each element of ( A ) by adding an outermost pair of parentheses. Inside each pair of parentheses, we wipe half the parentheses (left half) and consider the remaining ones (right half). We then map these parentheses to white and black balls respectively. Illustration: - Start with an element: (left(left(a_1 a_2right)a_3right)left(a_4 a_5right) ). - Add outer parentheses: (left(left(left(a_1 a_2right)a_3right)left(a_4 a_5right)right) ). - Remove the left half of each parenthesis: [ ((a_1 a_2) a_3) (a_4 a_5) rightarrow a_1 a_2) a_3) a_4 a_5) ] - In the final arrangement: - Map each parenthesis to a position in a sequence of balls such that - (a_1 = bigcirc, a_2 = 0, a_3 = bigcirc, a_4 = 0, a_5 = 0).

Since sqrt{2} is irrational, the rational and irrational components must be dealt with independently. 3. **Transform the Problem:** To simplify the problem, let’s consider starting from (1, 0) and analyze the movement rules. If we follow the same set of transformations, ensuring the structure of coordinates with the irrational component would separate the problem between rational and irrational parts. - **N**: This transformation from (x, y) to (x, y + 2x) maps (a, c) to (a, c + 2a). - **S**: This transformation from (x, y) to (x, y - 2x) maps (a, c) to (a, c - 2a). - **E**: This transformation from (x, y) to (x + 2y, y) maps (a, c) to (a + 2c, c). - **O**: This transformation from (x, y) to (x - 2y, y) maps (a, c) to (a - 2c, c). 4. **Developing a Sequence Representation:** Any sequence of transformations can be given as: [ a_1 mathrm{N} + a_2 mathrm{E} + a_3 mathrm{N} + cdots ] where a_i in mathbb{Z} setminus {0} (representing either positive counts for mathrm{N}, and mathrm{E} or corresponding negative counts for mathrm{S}, and mathrm{O}). 5. **Analyzing the Effect of Each Transformation:** - A kmathrm{N} transformation would move (a, c) to (a, c + 2ka) if k > 0 or (a, c - 2ka) if k < 0. - A kmathrm{E} transformation would move (a, c) to (a + 2kc, c) if k > 0 or (a - 2kc, c) if k < 0. 6. **Proving by Recurrence:** - Consider the absolute values of a and c. - After a transformation kmathrm{N} where k neq 0, the absolute value of c will always be larger than the absolute value of a or it will gain 2ka. - Conversely, after a transformation kmathrm{E} where k neq 0, the absolute value of a will always be larger than that of c or it will gain 2kc. - Since each step increases the magnitude of the smallest coordinate (by a multiple of 2 times the other), the distance of the point (a, c) from the origin 7. **Conclusion:** Given that the minimal absolute coordinate value always increases, the point cannot return to (1, 0). Similarly, mapped transformations do not allow return to (1, sqrt{2}) starting from (1, sqrt{2}) and following the problem rules.

The common chord (P_iQ_i) of circles (S) and (S_i) is a diameter of (S_i). Hence, the center (O) of circle (S) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (P_iQ_i).

In this scenario, circle (S) has only one unique center (O), making it unique. 6. **Collinear Points Case**: - If points (A), (B), and (C) are collinear, the perpendicular distances yield parallel lines ((l_A), (l_B), (l_C)) because the perpendiculars from (O) to (BC, CA, AB) are all along the same direction.

Each number in the sequence is of the form (n + sqrt{2n+1}) where (n) ranges from 1 to 100. - **Step 1: Check the nature of each root**: Each term (2n+1) is always odd. For it to be a perfect square, (2n+1) must equal (m^2) for some integer (m). As (m^2) is odd, (m) must also be odd. We solve (2n + 1 = m^2) to identify any rational roots. - **Step 2: Determine specific cases for rational roots**: (2n + 1 = 1^2, 3^2, 5^2, dots). Calculating when it reaches beyond 203, the calculations give us squares: (1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 121, 169) (last (m = 15^2 = 225) is too large).

If Jimmy has 45 oranges, how many apples and bananas would he need if 4 bananas also have the same weight as 3 apples, and he wants the combined weight of apples and bananas to equal the weight of his 45 oranges?","completion":"1. First, establish how many apples are needed for 45 oranges based on the ratio of 9 oranges to 6 apples: - For 9 oranges, 6 apples are required. - For 45 oranges, calculate using the scaling: 6 times frac{45}{9} = 30 apples. 2. Now, consider the conversion between apples and bananas where 4 bananas weigh as much as 3 apples. We need the combined count of apples and bananas in terms of apples: - Let a be the number of apples and b be the number of bananas. - Since 4 bananas = 3 apples, then b = frac{3}{4}a. 3. Since we know 30 apples are needed for 45 oranges, we can find the combination of a apples and b bananas such that a + b = 30: - Substitute b = frac{3}{4}a into a + b = 30, - a + frac{3}{4}a = 30, - frac{7}{4}a = 30, - a = frac{4}{7} times 30 = frac{120}{7} approx 17.14 approx 17 apples (rounding down to the nearest whole number), - b = frac{3}{4}a = frac{3}{4} times 17 approx 12.75 approx 13 bananas (rounding to complement apples to 30). Thus, Jimmy would need approximately boxed{17} apples and boxed{13} bananas to balance the weight of his 45 oranges. Conclusion: With 17 apples and 13 bananas, the combined equivalent in apple units is 17 + 13 cdot frac{3}{4} = 17 + 9.75 = 26.75 apple units. While this approach is approximate due to rounding, it aligns closely with the required 30 apple units, showing the solution is reasonable."},{"prompt":"Person A and person B both went to the same gas station to refuel their cars twice last week and this week. Person A refueled 20 liters each time, while person B refueled 200 yuan each time. If the gas prices were different last week and this week, then in these two refuelings, the one with the lower average price is: A: Person A B: Person B C: The same D: Cannot be determined","completion":"To solve this problem, we first need to establish the variables and equations based on the information given. Let's denote the unit prices of gas for the two refuelings as x yuan and y yuan, respectively, with the condition that x neq y to indicate that the prices were different for each refueling. For Person A, who refueled 20 liters each time, the total cost for two refuelings would be based on the sum of the prices per liter, thus 20x + 20y. Since they refueled a total of 40 liters, the average price per liter for Person A can be calculated as: [ frac{20x + 20y}{40} = frac{x + y}{2} ] For Person B, who spent 200 yuan each time, the total amount spent is 400 yuan. To find the average price per liter, we need to consider the total liters they could buy. For the first refueling at price x yuan per liter, they got frac{200}{x} liters, and for the second at price y yuan per liter, they got frac{200}{y} liters. The average price per liter for Person B is then the total spent divided by the total liters, which gives us: [ frac{400}{frac{200}{x} + frac{200}{y}} = frac{2xy}{x + y} ] To determine who had the lower average price, we compare the average prices of Person A and Person B by subtracting the average price of Person B from that of Person A: [ frac{x + y}{2} - frac{2xy}{x + y} = frac{(x + y)^2 - 4xy}{2(x + y)} = frac{(x - y)^2}{2(x + y)} ] Since (x - y)^2 is always non-negative and x neq y, this expression is strictly greater than 0. This means that the average price for Person A is higher than that for Person B, implying that Person B had the lower average price.

Now, let's calculate the total price without any discounts or taxes: Total price = Price of smartphone + Price of personal computer + Price of advanced tablet Total price = 300 + 800 + 1100 Total price = 2200 Next, we apply the 10% discount for buying all three products together: Discount = 10% of 2200 Discount = 0.10 * 2200 Discount = 220 So, the price after the discount is: Price after discount = Total price - Discount Price after discount = 2200 - 220 Price after discount = 1980 Finally, we need to add the 5% sales tax to the price after the discount: Sales tax = 5% of 1980 Sales tax = 0.05 * 1980 Sales tax = 99 Therefore, the final price you have to pay, including the sales tax, is: Final price = Price after discount + Sales tax Final price = 1980 + 99 Final price = 2079 So, you would have to pay boxed{2079} to buy one of each of the three products, including the sales tax."},{"prompt":"Among the following real numbers sqrt{2}, frac{π}{3}, frac{22}{7}, 0.1010010001ldots (with one more zero between adjacent 1s), sqrt[3]{5}, and sqrt{16}, the number of irrational numbers is ( ) A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: 4","completion":"To identify the number of irrational numbers among the given list, we analyze each number individually: 1. sqrt{2} is known to be an irrational number because it cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. 2. frac{pi}{3} is irrational because pi itself is an irrational number, and dividing an irrational number by an integer does not make it rational. 3. frac{22}{7} is a fraction representing a ratio of two integers, hence it is a rational number. 4. 0.1010010001ldots (with one more zero between adjacent 1s) does not terminate or repeat in a regular pattern, which is characteristic of irrational numbers. 5. sqrt[3]{5} is irrational because there is no integer that, when cubed, equals 5. 6. sqrt{16} = 4 is an integer, and all integers are rational numbers because they can be expressed as a fraction where the denominator is 1.

This implies that the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation x^{2}+ax+2b=0 must be less than 0 for there to be no real roots.

Since sin A neq 0 (because A is an angle in an acute triangle and thus cannot be 0^circ), we can divide both sides of the equation by sin A to get sin B = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. 3. Given that triangle ABC is an acute triangle, all angles are less than 90^circ. Therefore, the only value of B that satisfies sin B = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} is B = frac{pi}{3}. Thus, the measure of angle B is boxed{frac{pi}{3}}. Part (Ⅱ): Find the range of values for cos A + cos B + cos C 1. Knowing that B = frac{pi}{3} and triangle ABC is an acute triangle, we can express C as C = frac{2pi}{3} - A. 2. The sum cos A + cos B + cos C can be rewritten using the known values and trigonometric identities as follows: [ cos A + cos frac{pi}{3} + cos (frac{2pi}{3} - A) = cos A + frac{1}{2} + left(-frac{1}{2}cos A + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin Aright) = frac{1}{2}cos A + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin A + frac{1}{2} ] This simplifies to sin (A + frac{pi}{6}) + frac{1}{2} using the sine addition formula. 3. Since triangle ABC is an acute triangle, 0 < A < frac{pi}{2}, and thus frac{pi}{6} < A + frac{pi}{6} < frac{2pi}{3}. 4. This implies frac{sqrt{3}}{2} < sin (A + frac{pi}{6}) leqslant 1. 5. Adding frac{1}{2} to both sides of the inequality, we get frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{1}{2} < sin (A + frac{pi}{6}) + frac{1}{2} leqslant frac{3}{2}. Therefore, the range of values for cos A + cos B + cos C is boxed{left(frac{sqrt{3}+1}{2}, frac{3}{2}right]}."},{"prompt":"Roden went to a pet shop. He bought 15 gold fish and some blue fish.

When Pipe A is filling the tank with the leak, it takes 15 hours to fill the tank. Therefore, the combined rate of Pipe A and the leak is ( frac{1}{15} ) of the tank per hour.

To solve this problem, we must use the well-known fact that an integer is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. We start by verifying that the integer 88,888,888 (with all digits being 8 and having 8 digits) adheres to this criterion. 1. **Checking 88,888,888:** The number 88,888,888 has the following substrings: [ {8, 88, 888, 8888, 88888, 888888, 8888888, 88,888,888} ] Summing up the digits for each of these substrings: - (8 = 8) - (88 = 8 + 8 = 16) - (888 = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24) - (8888 = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 32) - (88888 = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 40) - (888888 = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 48) - (8888888 = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 56) - (88,888,888 = 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 64) None of these sums are multiples of 9. Hence, no substring of 88,888,888 is divisible by 9. 2. **Verification for ( N > 88,888,888 ):** Suppose ( N > 88,888,888 ). If ( N ) has 8 digits and involves digits beyond 8, say a 9, such as 98,888,888 or any other number, it automatically includes a substring divisible by 9 (the digit 9 itself). If ( N ) has more than 8 digits, say ( N = 328,346,785 ) (as provided in the example): - Compute cumulative sums of digits ( s_k ): [ begin{align*} s_0 &= 0 s_1 &= 3 s_2 &= 3 + 2 = 5 s_3 &= 3 + 2 + 8 = 13 s_4 &= 3 + 2 + 8 + 3 = 16 s_5 &= 3 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 4 = 20 s_6 &= 3 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 26 s_7 &= 3 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 33 s_8 &= 3 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 41 s_9 &= 3 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 5 = 46 end{align*} ] - Compute remainders when divided by 9: [ begin{align*} s_0 mod 9 &= 0 s_1 mod 9 &= 3 s_2 mod 9 &= 5 s_3 mod 9 &= 4 s_4 mod 9 &= 7 s_5 mod 9 &= 2 s_6 mod 9 &= 8 s_7 mod 9 &= 6 s_8 mod 9 &= 5 s_9 mod 9 &= 1 end{align*} ] Using the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these remainders must be equal.

Specifically, we need to show that: [ angle ZFE + angle ZYE = 180^circ ] First, note that ( overline{BE} ) and ( overline{CF} ) are altitudes of (triangle ABC), so (E) and (F) are the feet of the perpendiculars from (B) and (C) to (AC) and (AB), respectively. This implies: [ angle BFE = 90^circ quad text{and} quad angle CFE = 90^circ ] Since (D) is the antipodal point of (A) on the circumcircle of (triangle ABC), (AD) is a diameter of the circumcircle.

Now, consider the angles (angle ZFE) and (angle ZYE): [ angle ZFE = angle BFD ] because (F) lies on the circle (odot(BFEC)) and (D) is on the circle (odot(ABC)). Next, we need to find (angle ZYE). Since (Y) and (Z) are points where (DE) and (DF) intersect the circumcircle again, we have: [ angle ZYE = angle C + 90^circ - angle AYZ ] Since (D) is the antipodal point of (A), (angle ADZ = 90^circ).

Construct the line PF, which intersects the circles k_1 and k_2 again at points C and D respectively. 5. We aim to prove that F is the midpoint of segment CD. # Detailed Steps: First Solution: 1. Consider the power of point F with respect to circle k_1: [ F C cdot F P = F A cdot F Q ] 2. Similarly, the power of point F with respect to circle k_2: [ F D cdot F P = F B cdot F Q ] 3. From the symmetry in the setup, since F is the midpoint of AB, we have: [ F A = F B ] 4. This equality implies: [ F A cdot F Q = F B cdot F Q ] 5. Thus, combining the equations from the power of a point we get: [ F C cdot F P = F D cdot F P ] 6. Assuming F P neq 0, we can divide both sides by F P to get: [ F C = F D ] 7. Since C is on k_1 and D is on k_2, they cannot coincide. Therefore, F must be the midpoint: [ F ] 8. If F P = 0, which would mean F = P, then P would lie on AB line and AB would be degenerate to a point. But this contradicts the given condition that AB contains Q as a proper segment. This case leads to contradiction, so F P neq 0 is true. Therefore, F must be the midpoint of CD: [boxed{F}.] Second Solution: 1. Consider using the Inscribed Angle Theorem (Kerületi Szögek Tétele). 2. Observe the angles: [ angle CAQ = angle CPQ = angle DPQ = angle DBQ ] 3. From the setup, since F is the midpoint of AB, and AB contains Q, it follows: [ angle AQC = angle BQD ] 4. By symmetry, in triangles AFC and BFD, since AF = BF: [ angle AFC = angle BFD ] 5. Therefore, triangle AFC cong triangle BFD by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence theorem: [ AF = BF,quad angle AFC = angle BFD, quad angle CAF = angle DBF ] 6.

The total weight of fruit in one bag is the sum of the weight of the apples and the weight of the oranges, which must be less than or equal to 49 ounces (the maximum weight the bag can hold).

Consider an (n)-sided polygon, which is a polygon with (n) vertices. 2. To find the total number of lines (including the sides of the polygon and diagonals) that can be drawn between these (n) vertices, we use the combination formula (C_{n}^{2}), which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 points out of (n) points: [ C_{n}^{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] 3. Since an (n)-sided polygon has (n) sides, the number of diagonals (lines that are not sides) is: [ text{Number of diagonals} = C_{n}^{2} - n = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - n = frac{n(n-3)}{2} ] 4. Let's denote the total number of these diagonals as (m): [ m = frac{n(n-3)}{2} ] 5. We need to find the number of intersection points of the diagonals inside the polygon. Each pair of diagonals can intersect only once at most inside the polygon. The total number of ways to choose 2 diagonals out of (m) diagonals is: [ C_{m}^{2} = frac{m(m-1)}{2} ] 6. However, each vertex of the polygon is a point of intersection for the diagonals forming triangles with other vertices that do not include the original vertex.

These planes divide the sphere into eight regions, each of which is a curvilinear triangle. These triangles are alternately colored black and white, forming a checkerboard pattern on the sphere's surface. We need to prove that exactly half of the sphere's surface is colored black. 2. **Simplifying to Two Dimensions:** Consider a simpler two-dimensional analogy: a circle divided by two perpendicular diameters. This division creates four quadrants, each of which is a sector of the circle. If we color these sectors alternately black and white, it is clear that exactly half of the circle's area is black and the other half is white. 3. **Extending to Three Dimensions:** Now, extend this idea to three dimensions. The three pairwise perpendicular planes divide the sphere into eight regions. Each region is a curvilinear triangle, analogous to the sectors in the two-dimensional case. 4. **Symmetry Argument:** The key to the solution is the symmetry of the sphere and the planes. Each plane divides the sphere into two equal hemispheres. When we consider the three planes together, they divide the sphere into eight regions of equal volume and surface area. 5. **Checkerboard Coloring:** By coloring these regions alternately black and white, we ensure that each black region has a corresponding white region of equal area. This is because the planes are symmetric and the regions are congruent. 6. **Moving the Point:** If we move the initial point perpendicularly to one of the planes, say plane alpha, the plane alpha will move with the point. The areas of the black and white regions on either side of alpha will increase or decrease equally due to the symmetry of the sphere and the planes. This ensures that the total black area and the total white area remain equal. 7. **Conclusion:** Since the sphere is divided into eight regions of equal area and these regions are colored alternately, exactly half of the sphere's surface is colored black.

Therefore, we set up the equation: [ 14 + y + 4z = 21 ] Simplifying, we find: [ y + 4z = 7 ] 4. **Find Number of 25-Cent Coins:** We solve for (z) knowing that all values are integers and (y) and (z) must be non-negative and less than or equal to 15: [ y = 7 - 4z ] Testing possible values, (z = 1) gives (y = 3), and both values are feasible. Therefore, (z = 1). 5. **Conclusion:** Jeremy has 1 25-cent coin.

Each country has (n) mathematicians attending the conference. Every mathematician has interactions with (n+1) other mathematicians who are not from their own country. Step 2: Considering maximum interactions Consider a mathematician who has the maximum number of interactions with mathematicians from a single different country. Assume the maximum number of interactions is (m). Without loss of generality, let this mathematician be (a) from country (A), and that these (m) interactions are with mathematicians from country (B). Step 3: Establishing bounds for (m) Since there are only (n) mathematicians from country (B), it follows that (m leq n). Additionally, since (a) must interact with (n+1) mathematicians not from (A), there must be at least one mathematician from country (C) with whom (a) has interacted. Let this mathematician be (c) from country (C). Step 4: Proof by contradiction Suppose for contradiction that mathematician (c) has had no interactions with any of the (m) mathematicians from (B) who interacted with (a). In this case, (c) can interact with at most (n-m) mathematicians from (B) (since (n) total mathematicians minus the (m) already accounted for interacting with (a)). Therefore, (c) must have interacted with at least: [ n+1 - (n-m) = m+1 ] mathematicians from country (A). Step 5: Contradicting the maximality of (m) This means that (c) has interacted with at least (m+1) mathematicians from (A), which contradicts our initial assumption that (a) has the maximum number of interactions (m) with any set of mathematicians from a different country. Step 6: Conclusion Thus, our assumption that (c) does not interact with any of the (m) mathematicians from (B) must be false. Therefore, there must exist at least one mathematician (b) in (B) who has interacted with both (a) and (c).

The logarithm ( log_2(2^{12}) ) simplifies to 12, because ( 2^{12} ) is the result of raising 2 to the power of 12, and the logarithm base 2 of that is just 12.

We need to prove that no matter how the board is colored, there will always be two horizontal rows and two vertical columns such that the four squares at their intersections are all the same color. 2. **Analyzing the Columns:** Consider any single column of the chessboard. Since there are only 4 rows and 3 colors, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one color must appear at least twice in each column. This is because if each color appeared at most once, we would only use 3 colors, but we have 4 rows. 3. **Counting Configurations:** Let's denote the rows as R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4 and the columns as C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{19}. For each column, we can choose 2 out of the 4 rows to have the same color in binom{4}{2} = 6 ways. Since there are 3 colors, there are 6 times 3 = 18 possible configurations for each column. 4. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:** Since there are 19 columns and only 18 possible configurations for the pairs of rows with the same color, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two columns must have the same configuration. Let's denote these columns as C_i and C_j. 5. **Identifying the Rectangle:** Suppose in columns C_i and C_j, the same two rows, say R_a and R_b, have the same color, say red. This means the squares (R_a, C_i), (R_a, C_j), (R_b, C_i), and (R_b, C_j) are all red. These four squares form a rectangle with vertices at the intersections of rows R_a, R_b and columns C_i, C_j. 6. **Conclusion:** We have found two horizontal rows (R_a and R_b) and two vertical columns (C_i and C_j) such that the four squares at their intersections are all the same color (red in this case).

Denote these vertices by B, C, D, E. The edges were previously identified as AB, AC, AD, AE. 6. By tracing the graph, at least two edges among B, C, D, E must be present due to the sufficient number of total edges, forming needed additional connections. 7. Suppose we have the edges BC and DE.

Next, connect two vertices A, B in M_1 with an additional edge, giving us leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor + 1 total edges. 5.

Our goal is to find the smallest ( m ) such that there are always ( m ) lines passing through the origin in such a way that each polygon in the set intersects with at least one of these lines. 2. **Initial Observation:** By examining the case with 3 polygons, any line through the origin can intersect at most 2 of these polygons. Thus, it is known that ( m geq 2 ). 3. **Considering the General Case:** Given that there is a finite number of polygons, one of these polygons must subtend the smallest angle at the origin.

We will use an argument based on the visibility conditions. 3. **Visibility Argument:** Assume (A_i) can see ( A_{i-1}, A_{j}, A_{k}, A_{i+1} ) (denoted in a clockwise order). Note that (A_{i-1}) and (A_{i+1}) are adjacent vertices to (A_i). 4. **Consideration of Triangular Subdivisions:** Use the polygon’s triangular subdivisions containing the edges ( A_iA_j ) and ( A_iA_k ) to explore visibility: - By Lemma 1, ( A_{i-1} ) can see ( A_j ) and ( A_{i+1} ) can see ( A_k ). 5. **Proof by Contradiction Using Lemma 1 and Lemma 2:** - Lemma 1: Assume ( A_{i-1} ) can see ( A_j ). Let us consider triangular divisions involving ( A_i ). - Lemma 2: If ( A_j ) and ( A_k ) are vertices such that ( A_j ) can see ( A_{j-1} ) and ( A_{k} ) can see ( A_{i+1} ), then ( A_jA_k ) must be an edge. - Verify the structure by visually dividing the polygon and follow edge and internal visibility logic. You'll find that for ( n > 6 ), you would notice contradictions that break the visibility rule requiring each vertex to see exactly four other vertices. 6. **Reduction to ( n = 6 ):** - For ( n = 6 ), construct a hexagon and check polygonal subdivisions to ensure that exactly four vertices are visible from each vertex. Through inspection, determine the relationships between ( A_{i-1}, A_{i+1}, A_{i-2}, A_{i+2} ) at each vertex: - If (A_i ) sees ( A_{i-2} ) and ( A_{i+2} ), then verify if ( angle A_{i-2} A_i A_{i+2} ) does not cause any inconsistencies with previously reached conclusions. - Upon verification, if ( A_i ) cannot be consistently visible to four others, reduce further. 7. **Conclusion for ( n = 5 ):** - With five vertices, form a pentagon and analyze visibility: - Check if every vertex (A_i) can visually access exactly four other vertices. Visually and logically verify by configuring polygonal inner diagonals: - Confirm that with this setup, a stable configuration exists meeting given conditions. Thus the solution reduces to only one feasible integer satisfying the condition uniformly, which is: [ boxed{5} ]"},{"prompt":"A speaker delivered a talk for 90 minutes to a full auditorium.

This means if the original schedule required d days, the new schedule requires d - 4 days. 5. **Equation Setup**: We know the total number of tents to be produced in both scenarios and the daily production rates. For the original plan, the time to produce 7200 tents at a rate of x - 720 tents per day is frac{7200}{x - 720}. For the adjusted plan, producing 7200 times 1.2 tents at a rate of x tents per day takes frac{7200 times 1.2}{x} days. The difference in time between these two plans is 4 days.

According to the definition of a parabola, the locus of points equidistant from a fixed point, called the focus, and a fixed line, called the directrix, is indeed a parabola. In this case, our focus is (-2, 0) and the directrix is x = 2. The standard form of a parabola with a horizontal axis and vertex at the origin is given by y^2 = 4px, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Since the vertex of our parabola will be at the midpoint of the segment joining the directrix and the focus on the x-axis, we can calculate its location. The vertex is at left(frac{2 + (-2)}{2}, 0right) which simplifies to (0, 0). Therefore, the distance p from the vertex to the focus is 2 units, but since the parabola opens to the left (the focus is to the left of the vertex), we have a negative p. The equation of the parabola is then y^2 = -4px. Substituting p = 2, we have the equation y^2 = -8x. This is the equation of the locus that we were seeking. Hence, the equation of the trajectory of points equidistant from the left focus of the ellipse and the line x = 2 is [ boxed{y^2 = -8x}. ]"},{"prompt":"John is writing an article.

Since the train takes 5.999520038396929 seconds to cross the man, and the train is 100 m long, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time For the train to cross the man: 100 m = (Speed of train - Speed of man) * 5.999520038396929 s We already know the speed of the train in m/s, so we can solve for the speed of the man: 100 m = (17.5 m/s - Speed of man) * 5.999520038396929 s Now, let's solve for the speed of the man: 100 m = 17.5 m/s * 5.999520038396929 s - Speed of man * 5.999520038396929 s 100 m = 104.99160067239627 m - Speed of man * 5.999520038396929 s Now, we isolate the speed of the man: Speed of man * 5.999520038396929 s = 104.99160067239627 m - 100 m Speed of man * 5.999520038396929 s = 4.99160067239627 m Speed of man = 4.99160067239627 m / 5.999520038396929 s Speed of man ≈ 0.831946 m/s So, the speed of the man walking is approximately boxed{0.831946} m/s."},{"prompt":"Johns goes to the gym 3 times a week.

Since f(1)=m, the point of tangency (1,m) lies on y=x-1, thus m=0. Hence, f(x)=ln x. At x=e, f(e)=1 and f'(e)=frac{1}{e}. So the tangent line to f(x) at x=e is y-1=frac{1}{e}(x-e), which simplifies to y=frac{1}{e}x. (2) When 1 < x < e^{2}, we have 0 < ln x < 2, which implies 0 < f(x) < 2. We want to prove x < frac{2+f(x)}{2-f(x)}. By cross-multiplication, this is equivalent to proving f(x) > frac{2(x-1)}{x+1}. Let varphi (x)=f(x)-frac{2(x-1)}{x+1}=ln x-frac{2(x-1)}{x+1}. Then, varphi '(x)=frac{1}{x}-frac{2(x+1)-2(x-1)}{(x+1)^{2}}=frac{(x-1)^{2}}{x(x+1)^{2}}. When 1 < x < e^{2}, we have varphi(x) > 0. Therefore, varphi(x) is increasing on (1,e^{2}), and consequently, when 1 < x < e^{2}, we have varphi(x) > varphi(1)=0. This implies f(x) > frac{2(x-1)}{x+1}, and thus x < frac{2+f(x)}{2-f(x)}. (3) Let p(x)=frac{e}{x}-ln x and q(x)=e^{x-1}+a-ln x. Since p'(x)=-frac{e}{x^{2}}-frac{1}{x} < 0, p(x) is decreasing on xin[1,+infty), and p(e)=0. Thus, when 1leqslant xleqslant e, p(x)geqslant 0, and when x > e, p(x) < 0. Since q'(x)=e^{x-1}-frac{1}{x}, and q''(x)=e^{x-1}+frac{1}{x^{2}} > 0, q'(x) is increasing on xin[1,+infty), and q'(1)=0. Hence, when xin[1,+infty), q'(x)geqslant 0, and q(x) is increasing on xin[1,+infty). Therefore, q(x)geqslant q(1)=a+1 > 0. ① When 1leqslant xleqslant e, we have |p(x)|-|q(x)|=p(x)-q(x)=frac{e}{x}-e^{x-1}-a. Let m(x)=frac{e}{x}-e^{x-1}-a. Then, m'(x)=-frac{e}{x^{2}}-e^{x-1} < 0. Since m(x) is decreasing on xin[1,+infty), we have m(x)leqslant m(1)=e-1-a. As ageqslant 2, we get m(x) < 0, and thus |p(x)| < |q(x)|. Therefore, frac{e}{x} is closer to f(x) than e^{x-1}+a. ② When x > e, we have |p(x)|-|q(x)|=-p(x)-q(x)=-frac{e}{x}+2ln x-e^{x-1}-a < 2ln x-e^{x-1}-a. Let n(x)=2ln x-e^{x-1}-a. Then, n'(x)=frac{2}{x}-e^{x-1}, and n''(x)=-frac{2}{x^{2}}-e^{x-1} < 0. Thus, when x > e, n'(x) is decreasing. So n'(x) < n'(e)=frac{2}{e}-e^{e-1} < 0, and n(x) is decreasing when x > e. Therefore, n(x) < n(e)=2-a-e^{e-1} < 0. Consequently, |p(x)| < |q(x)|, and frac{e}{x} is closer to f(x) than e^{x-1}+a.

Let's define the concentration function: [ Q(X ; l)=sup _{x in mathbb{R}} mathrm{P}(x < X leqslant x + l), quad l geqslant 0 ] Part (a): 3. The first part of the problem is to show that if ( X ) and ( Y ) are independent random variables, then the following inequality holds: [ Q(X + Y ; l) leqslant min left(Q(X ; l), Q(Y ; l)right) quad text {for all } l geqslant 0. ] **Proof:** 4. Let ( F_X ) and ( F_Y ) be the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of random variables ( X ) and ( Y ), respectively. 5.

Taking the supremum over ( z in mathbb{R} ): [ Q(X + Y ; l) = sup_{z in mathbb{R}} mathrm{P}(z < X + Y leqslant z + l) ] 7.

Part (b): 10. The second part is to show that there exists some ( x_l^{*} ) such that ( Q(X ; l) = mathrm{P}(x_l^{*} < X leqslant x_l^{*} + l) ). Furthermore, the distribution function of ( X ) is continuous if and only if ( Q(X ; 0) = 0 ). **Proof:** 11. We know the definition: [ Q(X ; 0) = sup _{x in mathbb{R}}[F_X(x) - F_X(x-)] ] 12.

The required equality ( Q(X ; l) = mathrm{P}left(x_l^{*} < X leqslant x_l^{*} + lright) ) for some ( x_l^{*} in mathbb{R} ) follows from the easily verifiable relationship: [ left{omega: x^{*} leqslant X(omega) leqslant x^{*} + lright} supseteq varlimsup_{n}left{omega: x_n < X(omega) leqslant x_n + lright} ] if ( x^{*} = lim_{n} x_n ). 15.

From the basic theory of Markov chains, we have the following equations: [ p_m = frac{binom{n-2m+2}{2}}{binom{n-m+1}{2}} p_{m+1} + ldots ] where the omitted terms come from the possibilities of two blue or one red and one blue bacteria meeting to land us in position ( (n-m, m) ). 6. **Solving the equations:** To solve these equations, we need to consider the additional constraint: [ sum_m p_m = 1 ] This constraint ensures that the total probability is 1. 7. **Conclusion:** The answer in practice is \\"yes\\" for any particular value of ( n ), but it may not work out cleanly in general.

According to the problem statement, we are given that: frac{AF}{FD} = frac{BG}{GE} Hence, it follows that: frac{AF}{AD} = frac{BG}{BE} 2. By the invariance of cross ratios, we have: frac{AF}{FD} cdot frac{ID}{AI} = (A, D ; F, I) = (E, B ; H, G) = frac{EH}{HB} cdot frac{GB}{EG} Given the earlier relation, we can simplify to: frac{ID}{AI} = frac{EH}{HB} Thus, multiplying both sides by frac{AD}{AD}: frac{ID}{AD} = frac{EH}{EB} 3. Let's denote M as the intersection point of ( BE ) and ( AD ). By applying further invariances of cross ratios, we get: frac{HM}{MB} cdot frac{EB}{HE} = (H, B; M, E) = (F, D; M, A) = frac{FM}{MD} cdot frac{AD}{FA} Also, frac{MG}{GB} cdot frac{EB}{ME} = (M, B; G, E) = (M, D; I, A) = frac{MI}{ID} cdot frac{AD}{MA} 4.

Noting that ( ABDE ) is a cyclic quadrilateral because ( angle AEB = angle ADB ), we can apply the chord theorem with respect to M and the circle passing through ( A, B, D, ) and ( E ) to obtain: MA cdot MD = ME cdot MB 6. Finally, combining equations (8) and the resulting product (step 4) with the cyclic nature of ( ABDE ) (step 5), we conclude: HM cdot MG = FM cdot MI Therefore, by the converse of the chord theorem, the points ( H, F, G, ) and ( I ) must lie on a circle.

We can see that our data points 110, 114, 121, 119, 126 can be represented as -8, -4, 3, 1, 8 relative to 114. **Step 3: Calculate the mean** The mean of -8, -4, 3, 1, 8 is bar{x} = frac{-8 + (-4) + 3 + 1 + 8}{5} = 0. **Step 4: Calculate the variance** Now we can calculate the variance: S^2 = frac{1}{5} left[(64 + 16 + 9 + 1 + 64)right] = 30.8.

Therefore, if MH cap FE = H', then MH > MH'. The distance from M to NP is greater than the distance from M to FE, which equals half of the distance from A to BC. 2. **Consider the configuration of points:** We can assume P in AF, N in EC, M in BD (or P in BF, N in EA, M in DC, but this is analogous). Fix triangle ABC, and consider the triangle MNP which minimizes X, and assume X < x/2. This is possible since we are taking M, N, P in closed intervals. 3. **Analyze specific cases:** - If M = D, then the altitude from P to MN is greater than half of the altitude from C to AB. - If M = B, then the altitude from N to MP is greater than or equal to that of E to BA, which is half of the altitude from C to AB. 4. **General case analysis:** Otherwise, we can assume that M, N, P are different from A, B, C, D, E, F. If we start to move N towards E (unless angle N = 90^circ), then X will increase by definition, but the altitude from P to MN decreases and so does the altitude from N to MP. Therefore, the altitude from M to PN must equal X (otherwise, the resulting triangle MN'P will have a smaller X, since the altitude from M to PN' increased but is still smaller than the original X). Similarly, the altitude from N to PM and the altitude from P to MN equal X. Therefore, MNP is equilateral, or right-angled and isosceles. 5. **Equilateral triangle case:** If MNP is equilateral, let h be its altitude. Notice that, WLOG, angle A ge 60^circ, and thus A lies inside the reflection of the circumcircle of MNP across NP.

Now, let's calculate the amount after each 6-month period: First 6 months: A1 = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) A1 = 4000(1 + 0.05)^(1) = 4000 * 1.05 = 4200 Second 6 months: A2 = A1(1 + r/n)^(nt) A2 = 4200(1 + 0.06)^(1) = 4200 * 1.06 = 4452 Third 6 months: A3 = A2(1 + r/n)^(nt) A3 = 4452(1 + 0.07)^(1) = 4452 * 1.07 = 4763.64 Fourth 6 months: A4 = A3(1 + r/n)^(nt) A4 = 4763.64(1 + 0.08)^(1) = 4763.64 * 1.08 = 5144.73 The compound interest (CI) is the final amount (A4) minus the principal (P): CI = A4 - P = 5144.73 - 4000 = 1144.73 Now, we know that the simple interest (SI) on the unknown sum for 3 years at different increasing interest rates is half of this CI: SI = CI / 2 = 1144.73 / 2 = 572.365 Let's denote the unknown sum as S. The SI for each year is calculated as follows: SI for the first year at 8%: SI1 = S * 8% * 1 SI for the second year at 12%: SI2 = S * 12% * 1 SI for the third year at 17% (12% + 5%): SI3 = S * 17% * 1 The total SI for 3 years is the sum of SI1, SI2, and SI3: Total SI = SI1 + SI2 + SI3 572.365 = S * 8% * 1 + S * 12% * 1 + S * 17% * 1 572.365 = S * (8% + 12% + 17%) 572.365 = S * 37% Now, we can solve for S: S = 572.365 / 37% S = 572.365 / 0.37 S = 1546.93 Therefore, the sum placed on simple interest is Rs. boxed{1546.93} ."},{"prompt":"Roadster's Paving Company used 10 tons of cement to pave Lexi's street and some tons of cement to pave Tess's street.

The triangle inequality states that for any triangle with side lengths (x, y, z): 1. (x + y > z) 2. (y + z > x) 3. (z + x > y) Let's apply this to our side lengths (sqrt{a}, sqrt{b}, sqrt{c}): 1. (sqrt{a} + sqrt{b} > sqrt{c}) 2. (sqrt{b} + sqrt{c} > sqrt{a}) 3. (sqrt{c} + sqrt{a} > sqrt{b}) We need to verify these inequalities. Since (a, b, c) are the side lengths of a triangle, they already satisfy the triangle inequality: 1. (a + b > c) 2. (b + c > a) 3. (c + a > b) Now, let's square both sides of the inequalities involving (sqrt{a}, sqrt{b}, sqrt{c}): 1. ((sqrt{a} + sqrt{b})^2 > (sqrt{c})^2) [ a + b + 2sqrt{ab} > c ] Since (a + b > c), adding (2sqrt{ab}) (which is positive) ensures the inequality holds. 2.

We know he had 300 potatoes initially and has 47 left, so: Total given away = Initial amount - Remaining amount Total given away = 300 - 47 Total given away = 253 We already know how many potatoes Gina and Tom received, so we can calculate the number of potatoes given to Anne by subtracting the potatoes given to Gina and Tom from the total given away: Anne's potatoes = Total given away - (Gina's potatoes + Tom's potatoes) Anne's potatoes = 253 - (69 + 138) Anne's potatoes = 253 - 207 Anne's potatoes = 46 Now we have the number of potatoes given to Anne (46) and the number given to Tom (138). To find the ratio of Anne's potatoes to Tom's potatoes, we divide the number of potatoes Anne received by the number Tom received: Ratio (Anne:Tom) = Anne's potatoes / Tom's potatoes Ratio (Anne:Tom) = 46 / 138 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor. In this case, the greatest common divisor is 46: Ratio (Anne:Tom) = (46/46) / (138/46) Ratio (Anne:Tom) = 1 / 3 So the ratio of the number of potatoes given to Anne compared to the number given to Tom is boxed{1:3} ."},{"prompt":"What is the value of displaystylefrac{275^2245^2}{30}?","completion":"Using the difference of squares formula, we rewrite (275^2 - 245^2) as ((275+245)(275-245)). - Compute (275 + 245 = 520) - Compute (275 - 245 = 30) Now substitute these into the expanded formula: [ frac{(275+245)(275-245)}{30} = frac{520 cdot 30}{30} ] The (30) in the numerator and denominator cancel out: [ frac{520 cdot 30}{30} = 520 ] So the answer is (boxed{520})."},{"prompt":"Consider a shaded region made of 13 unit squares, resting along the xaxis and the yaxis.

Also, AB = CD. 2. **Identifying the Plane alpha:** - alpha is the unique plane that is parallel to both skew lines AB and CD. 3. **Direction of Projection:** - We can choose an arbitrary line l that intersects the plane alpha as the direction of projection. 4. **Case 1: Line l is parallel to the edge BC or AC** - If l is parallel to the edge BC or AC, the projection of the tetrahedron onto the plane alpha is a right isosceles triangle. - Explanation: Since l is parallel to an edge of the tetrahedron, all the vertical edges of the tetrahedron will project to a single point on the plane. The remaining edges will project to form a right isosceles triangle. 5. **Case 2: Line l passes through vertex C and the midpoint of edge AB** - In this scenario, the parallel projection of the tetrahedron onto plane alpha is an isosceles triangle with a height equal to the base length. - Explanation: Since l passes through C and the midpoint of AB, the symmetry ensures that the projection forms an isosceles triangle with specific geometric properties. 6. **Case 3: Line l through midpoints of edges AB and CD** - When l passes through the midpoints of edges AB and CD, the parallel projection of the tetrahedron is a square. - Explanation: Midpoints of these edges determine a central symmetric projection, leading to a square. 7. **Case 4: Line l through arbitrary interior points of edges AB and CD** - Here, the parallel projection of the tetrahedron is a quadrilateral with diagonals that are mutually perpendicular. - Explanation: Arbitrary points introduce asymmetry, and the resulting projection is a general quadrilateral, yet the inherent perpendicularity of diagonals stems from the tetrahedron's symmetry. 8. **Case 5: Line l passes through vertex C and any point M on the ray AB (but not on the segment AB)** - The parallel projection of the tetrahedron in this case results in a non-isosceles right triangle. - Explanation: Since l extends beyond AB, the projection stretches asymmetrically leading to a right triangle that is not isosceles. 9. **Other Quadrilaterals:** - The tetrahedron may also project into various quadrilaterals including an isosceles trapezoid. For instance, an isosceles trapezoid ABCD with sides AB and CD being perpendicular. **Conclusion:** The projection of a regular tetrahedron DABC onto the plane alpha can take several forms based on the direction of the projection line l: a right isosceles triangle, an isosceles triangle with height equal to its base, a square, a general quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals, a non-isosceles right triangle, or other quadrilaterals such as an isosceles trapezoid. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Suppose a single bench at the community park can either accommodate 8 adults or 12 children.

Let the two remaining numbers be (a^2) and (b^2). The condition for the second player's victory is: [ a^2 - b^2 equiv 0 pmod{13}. ] 3. **Difference of Squares:** Recall that the difference of squares can be factored: [ a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b). ] For this to be divisible by 13, at least one of the factors, (a + b) or (a - b), must be divisible by 13. 4. **Strategy for the Second Player:** The second player's strategy relies on ensuring that the remaining two numbers form a pair ((a, b)) such that (a + b equiv 0 pmod{13}). For this, we need to look at potential pairs that sum to a multiple of 13. 5. **Specific Pairing:** Notice that: [ 1 + 1000 = 1001 = 13 times 77. ] Therefore, numbers that sum to 1001 will be crucial for the second player's strategy. 6. **Generalizing the Sum:** Generally, if (n) is a number from 1 to 1000, then (1001 - n) will also be within this range (for (n) running from 1 to 500), ensuring that: [ n + (1001 - n) = 1001 equiv 0 pmod{13}. ] 7. **Action Plan:** Given the pattern above, here are the steps the second player should follow: 1.

Among these configurations, focus on the one that minimizes the total sum of the lengths of the segments. 3. **Use Optimal Configuration**: Assume we have found the configuration where the total length of the segments is minimized. We will argue that this configuration must have segments that do not intersect. Suppose, for contradiction, that there are two segments, say overline{AB} and overline{CD}, that intersect one another. 4. **Intersection Implication**: If segments overline{AB} and overline{CD} intersect, we can replace these segments with overline{AC} and overline{BD}. This operation is often called \\"uncrossing\\" the segments. 5. **Apply Triangle Inequality**: By the triangle inequality, the sum of the lengths of the new segments (overline{AC} and overline{BD}) is strictly less than the sum of the lengths of the original intersecting segments (overline{AB} and overline{CD}). Therefore, [ |overline{AC}| + |overline{BD}| < |overline{AB}| + |overline{CD}| ] 6. **Contradiction of Minimal Sum**: The above inequality implies that the total length of the segments can be decreased by uncrossing the segments. However, this contradicts our initial assumption that we started with the configuration that minimizes the total sum of the distances. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, no such configuration minimizing the sum of segment lengths can have intersecting segments.

To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, if the speed is 44 km/h, in m/s it would be: 44 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 44 * (10/36) m/s = 12.22 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge. The train takes 45 seconds to cross the bridge, so the distance covered is: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 12.22 m/s * 45 s = 549.9 meters (approximately) The total distance covered includes the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. To find the length of the train, we subtract the length of the bridge from the total distance: Length of the train = Total distance - Length of the bridge Length of the train = 549.9 m - 300 m = 249.9 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{249.9} meters."},{"prompt":"Let (left(xi_{n}right)_{n geqslant 1}) be a sequence of identically distributed random variables.

This constraint significantly restricts the order in which numbers can appear. Step-by-step Analysis: 1. **Base Case Analysis**: - If a_1 = 10, then 10 must be followed by 9 (since 10-1=9 and 10+1 is not in the range). Continuing this logic, 9 must be followed by 8, and so on, down to 1. This gives us exactly one sequence: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 2. **General Case Analysis**: - If a_i = 10 for some i > 1, then all numbers from 10 down to 11-i must appear in the sequence before 10 and in decreasing order (since each number k must be preceded by k-1). The numbers 1 to 10-i must then follow in decreasing order, as they cannot appear before their immediate predecessor. 3. **Recursive Formula Development**: - Define f(n) as the number of valid sequences of length n under the given constraints. - If a_i = n (the largest number in a sequence of length n), then the numbers n, n-1, ..., n-i+1 must appear in the first i positions in decreasing order. The remaining positions i+1 to n must be filled with the numbers 1 to n-i in a valid sequence of length n-i. - Therefore, f(n) = sum_{i=1}^{n} f(n-i), where f(0) = 1 (the empty sequence is trivially valid). 4. **Computing f(n)**: - We observe that f(n) = 2^{n-1} for n geq 1. This can be shown by induction: - **Base case**: f(1) = 1 = 2^{1-1}. - **Inductive step**: Assume f(k) = 2^{k-1} for all k < n.

It is known that any three points are non-collinear. We need to investigate if there could be exactly 2017 triangles formed by these points that are oriented in a clockwise direction. 2. **Concept of Clockwise and Counterclockwise Triangles:** A triangle formed by three points ( P_i, P_j, ) and ( P_k ) (with indices ordered ( i < j < k )) is said to be \\"clockwise\\" (oriented counter-clockwise) if when listed in increasing order of indices, the sequence ( P_i, P_j, P_k ) appears in a clockwise direction on the plane. 3. **Arranging Points on a Circle:** Let's consider initially placing all points ( P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{100} ) in reverse order (counterclockwise) around a circle. In this setup, no triangles will be clockwise because any three points ( P_i, P_j, P_k ) (where ( i < j < k )) in the cyclic order will appear in a counterclockwise manner. 4. **Changing Orientation by Moving Points:** Next, we want to explore changing the orientation of triangles from counterclockwise to clockwise. We can achieve this by moving a point ( P_i ) such that it crosses the line formed by two other points ( P_j ) and ( P_k ). Every time ( P_i ) crosses line ( P_jP_k ), the orientation of the triangle ( P_iP_jP_k ) will change from counterclockwise to clockwise or vice versa. 5. **Maintaining Inversion Control:** Ensure that during each operation, only one point crosses the line defined by any pair of points at a time. This guarantees that the orientation change affects only that particular triangle and not others. 6. **Continuing the Process:** Continue this process where points ( P_i, P_j, P_k ) are suitably moved to change orientations. After sufficient operations, eventually, all points can be arranged again such that they follow a circular order that induces all clockwise triangles. 7. **Counting Total Triangular Combinations:** Finally, recall that the total number of triangles formed by 100 points is given by the combination formula: [ binom{100}{3} = frac{100!}{3! cdot (100-3)!} = frac{100 times 99 times 98}{6} = 161700 ] Since 161700 exceeds 2017, through controlled operations of point movements and transformations, it is always possible to achieve exactly 2017 clockwise-oriented triangles at some point. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Yes, it is possible to have exactly 2017 clockwise-oriented triangles.}} ]"},{"prompt":"f the complex number z satisfies the equation z = (z + 1)i (where i is the imaginary unit), then the point corresponding to the conjugate of the complex number overline{z} lies in A: the first quadrant B: the second quadrant C: the third quadrant D: the fourth quadr","completion":"From the equation z = (z + 1)i, we have z = frac{i}{1 - i}.

According to safety regulations, when a train is traveling between one signal light and the next, other trains are not allowed to pass that signal light. However, trains can stand still at a signal light, one after another (the length of the train is considered to be 0). Now there are n trains that need to travel from signal light 1 to signal light m, and the speeds of the n trains are all different, but each train travels at a constant speed. Prove that no matter how the sequence of train operations is arranged, the shortest time required for the kth train to reach signal light m is always the same, starting from the moment the first train departs from signal light 1.","completion":"1. Let the time taken for the i-th train to travel from one signal light to the next be t_i, where i=1,2, ldots, n. 2. Suppose ( t_1 < t_2 < ldots < t_n ). If the trains start in the order 1,2, ldots, n to minimize the total time, then each train departs immediately when allowed by the safety rules. 3. Therefore, the total time required for all trains under this optimal order arrangement is: t_1 + t_2 + cdots + t_{n-1} + (m-1) t_n. 4. Now, we use mathematical induction to prove that the total shortest time required remains the same regardless of the departure order of the trains. **Inductive Step:** 5. Base case: When n=1, the conclusion holds as the entire process is trivial for one train. 6. Assume that the conclusion (1) holds for n=k. That is, for k trains, starting in the order 1,2, ldots, k, the minimum total time required is: t_1 + t_2 + cdots + t_{k-1} + (m-1) t_k. 7. Now consider n=k+1. Assume the k+1 trains start in order of their speeds from fastest to slowest, i.e., t_1, t_2, ldots, t_{k+1}. 8. Suppose the first train to start is train i_1 and the second train is train i_2. - If i_1 < i_2, then train i_1 only affects the process by causing train i_2 to start after t_{i_1}. 9. By the induction hypothesis, the time for the other k trains to complete their journey from signal 1 to signal m (starting after the first train i_1) is: t_1 + t_2 + cdots + t_{n-1} + (m-1) t_n - t_{i_1}. 10. Therefore, the total time used is still: t_1 + t_2 + cdots + t_{n-1} + (m-1) t_n. 11. If i_1 > i_2, we need to analyze the effect of swapping the speeds of trains i_1 and i_2. 12. From signal light 1 to 2, train i_2 originally waits for t_{i_1} and takes t_{i_2} to travel, taking a total of t_{i_1} + t_{i_2}. 13. After swapping, train i_2 waits for t_{i_2} and takes t_{i_1} to travel, still a total of t_{i_1} + t_{i_2}. 14. For subsequent segments between signal lights, initially, train i_2 waits t_{i_1} - t_{i_2} and takes t_{i_2}. 15. Upon swapping, train i_2 does not wait but travels with t_{i_1}. Thus, overall time remains unchanged for each segment. 16. Therefore, the total time from starting to finishing remains unchanged after this speed swap. 17. Thus, if total time does not change regardless of speed order, we conclude the minimum total time required is fixed as: t_1 + t_2 + cdots + t_{n-1} + (m-1) t_{n}. 18.

If the point O lies on the curve Gamma, the problem is straightforward since the line connecting any two points on Gamma that are symmetric to each other with respect to O automatically passes through O. 2. **Assuming O is Not on Gamma:** We assume that the point O does not lie on the curve Gamma. Under this assumption, we examine the properties of the curve Gamma and its symmetric counterpart. 3. **Introduction of Symmetric Curve Gamma^{prime}:** Let Gamma^{prime} be the image of the curve Gamma under symmetry with respect to the point O. Symmetry here means that each point on Gamma is reflected through O to a corresponding point on Gamma^{prime}. 4. **Intersection of Gamma and Gamma^{prime}:** If the curves Gamma and Gamma^{prime} do not intersect, then the areas separated by Gamma cannot be equal. This is because, for Gamma to divide the square into regions of equal area, Gamma must intersect its symmetric counterpart Gamma^{prime}. 5. **Existence of Intersection Point X:** Let X be a point of intersection between Gamma and Gamma^{prime}. Without loss of generality, assume there is at least one point where Gamma and Gamma^{prime} intersect (which must be true for areas to be equal). 6. **Symmetry of Intersection Points:** Let X^{prime} be the symmetric point of X with respect to the center O. By the construction of symmetry, X^{prime} is on Gamma, since Gamma^{prime} transitions into Gamma through symmetry. 7. **Connecting the Intersection Points:** The line XX^{prime}, which connects X and its symmetric point X^{prime}, passes through the center O by definition of symmetry. This line XX^{prime} is our desired line that passes through the center O and intersects Gamma at two points. 8. **Conclusion:** Through the above steps, we have demonstrated that it is always possible to find two points A and B on the curve Gamma such that the line AB passes through the center O of the square.

Set t = sqrt{x - 1}, where t geq 0 because the square root is always non-negative. This gives us two equations to work with: - The original equation becomes t^2 = t. - The definition of t gives us t = sqrt{x - 1}. **Step 2:** Solving the transformed equation From t^2 = t, we rearrange the equation to get t^2 - t = 0, which simplifies to t(t - 1) = 0. This implies two solutions for t: - t = 0 - t = 1 **Step 3:** Finding x values corresponding to t For t = 0, substituting back to t = sqrt{x - 1} gives sqrt{x - 1} = 0. Solving for x gives x = 1.

Since the individuals have no differences and the total number is not large, random sampling can be used, which is simple random sampling. 2.

Based on this number, adding multiples of the segment interval gives the sampling number, which is systematic sampling. 3. When individuals have clear differences, stratified sampling is chosen, which is stratified sampling. Therefore, the answer is A.

Determine all values of ( r ) satisfying the following property: The midpoint of any two points in a good set also lies in the set.","completion":"To address the problem, we need to investigate which rational values r in [-1, 1] allow a good set S to fulfill the property that the midpoint of any two points in the set also lies in the set. Here’s the detailed solution: 1. **Parameterizing r as a rational number:** Since r is a rational number in the interval [-1, 1], we can express r in the form frac{a}{b} where gcd(a, b) = 1 and b > 0. 2. **Introducing the rotation complex number omega:** Recall that theta = cos^{-1}(r). We define a complex number corresponding to this rotation: [ omega = e^{itheta} = cos(theta) + i sin(theta) ] Given that cos(theta) = r = frac{a}{b}, we have: [ omega = frac{a}{b} pm i frac{sqrt{b^2 - a^2}}{b} ] 3. **Defining the good set S_infty:** We will construct the smallest good set containing the points 0 and 1 step by step. - Let S_0 = { 0, 1 } - Inductively define S_i as the union of S_{i-1} and the set containing all points that can be obtained by rotating each point of S_{i-1} about another point in S_{i-1} using the scale factor omega. - The ultimate set is ( S_infty = bigcup_{i geq 0} S_i ). 4. **Analyzing the membership of midpoint frac{1}{2}:** The critical observation is to consider if frac{1}{2} lies within S_infty for any rational values of r. 5. **Case 1: b is odd:** - Consider the ring ( A = mathbb{Z}_{{b}} = left{ frac{s}{t} mid s, t in mathbb{Z}, t mid b^infty right} ), which includes all rationals with denominators dividing any power of b. - For b odd, omega in A[sqrt{b^2 - a^2}] ensures that all points in S_infty have denominators which are divisors of some power of b. - Thus, frac{1}{2} notin A[sqrt{b^2 - a^2}] as 2 is not a divisor of an odd number, proving frac{1}{2} notin S_infty. 6. **Case 2: b is even and |b - a| neq 1:** - Denote D = b^2 - a^2 equiv 3 pmod{4}, meaning D equiv 3 pmod{4}. - Let p be a prime divisor of b - a. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, p neq 2. - Define the ring ( A = mathbb{Z}_{(p)} = left{ frac{s}{t} mid s, t in mathbb{Z}, p nmid t right} ), which includes rationals with denominators coprime to p. - Modulo p, the rotation omega simplifies to 1 since ( frac{a}{b} equiv 1 pmod{p} ), implying the rotation is effectively the identity mod p. - Thus, the image of S_infty under this mapping modulo p must lie in ( {0, 1} ), and hence frac{1}{2} notin A[sqrt{-D}] modulo p. 7. **Case 3: r = frac{4n-1}{4n} for some integer n:** - For a = 2n-1 and b = 2n, omega = frac{2n-1 pm sqrt{1-4n}}{2n}. - Examine the ring ( B = mathbb{Z}_{(2)} = left{ frac{s}{t} mid s, t in mathbb{Z}, t text{ odd} right} ). - B[omega], where omega is an algebraic integer with an odd denominator, since omega roots a monic polynomial: ( (T-1)^2 + frac{1}{n}(T-1) - frac{1}{n} = 0 ), implies that every element in S_infty has an odd denominator. - Thus, frac{1}{2} notin B[omega]. **Conclusion:** The solution shows that the values of r are precisely rationals of the form frac{4n - 1}{4n} for some integer n. These forms ensure the midpoint frac{1}{2} can be included in S_infty.

This means we cannot directly draw the entire segment ( [AB] ) at once but can draw segments of length strictly less than ( AB ). 2. **Idea**: The idea is to introduce an intermediate point ( C ) such that ( C ) lies strictly between ( A ) and ( B ) on the same line. We will then draw ( [AC] ) and ( [CB] ), both of which are shorter than ( AB ), using our shorter ruler. 3. **Using Desargues' Theorem**: To locate the point ( C ) on the line segment ( [AB] ), we will use Desargues' theorem. Desargues' theorem deals with the condition when two triangles are in perspective from a point, and consequently, their corresponding sides intersect on a line (or are parallel). 4. **Choosing an Auxiliary Point and Drawing Initial Lines**: Choose an auxiliary point ( T ) in the plane such that it is convenient for constructing the required alignment. The projection of point ( T ) on the line ( (AB) ) should ideally lie within the segment ( [AB] ). 5. **Constructing Lines from ( T )**: Draw three lines from the point ( T ) and name them ( d_1 ), ( d_2 ), and ( d_3 ). 6. **Forming Intersecting Lines and Points**: - Draw two lines from point ( B ) such that they intersect the line ( d_1 ) at points ( U ) and ( U' ), respectively. - Similarly, let the same two lines intersect ( d_3 ) at points ( W ) and ( W' ), respectively. 7. **Creating Two Triangles**: - Draw segments ( [AW] ) and ( [AW'] ). - These segments will intersect ( d_2 ) at points ( V ) and ( V' ), respectively, forming two triangles: ( triangle UVW ) and ( triangle U'V'W' ). 8. **Finding Intersection Point ( C )**: Locate the intersection point ( C ) of the lines ( (UV) ) and ( (U'V') ). According to Desargues' theorem, since the triangles are in perspective from a point, we know that points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) will be collinear. 9. **Drawing the Required Segments**: Now, we can draw the two shorter segments ( [AC] ) and ( [CB] ). Since these are shorter than ( AB ), they fit within the constraints of our ruler. 10. **Conclusion**: We have successfully drawn the segment ( [AB] ) by splitting it into ( [AC] ) and ( [CB] ) using Desargues' theorem and geometric constructions.

We are given 99 copies of a regular 101-gon, with vertices labeled from 1 to 101. 2. We need to determine if it is possible to stack these 99 regular 101-gons such that the sums of the labels along each edge of the stack are equal. The polygons may be flipped during stacking. 3. Consider a specific edge, say the edge from vertex 1 to vertex 101. Note that in a regular 101-gon, the edge labels are consecutive (in this case, 1 and 101). 4. Importantly, if we examine the situation over the entire stack of 99 polygons, not every edge will necessarily maintain the same pair of vertices due to the vertices being able to be flipped. 5. For the sums of the labels along the edges of the stack to be equal, consider that each edge from one layer of the stack must pair up with an edge from the next such that the sums of their labels along any given edge are consistent. 6. Specifically, if we look at two different positions where these sums might be calculated and compare: - One side of an edge (for instance, from vertex 1 to vertex 101) contains pairs ( (1, 101), (2, 100), (3, 99) ldots ) - Each of these pairs will generate specific sums ( (1+101), (2+100), (3+99) ldots ) 7.

(2) We have two cases depending on the slope of line l: (i) If the slope of l does not exist, then F(-2,0), and the equation of line l is x = -2.

Since a+2 is to the right of a+1, the area under the curve to the right of a+2 is less than the area to the right of a+1.

Specifically, if AF is the shorter leg, then: [AF = frac{1}{2} cdot AD = frac{1}{2} cdot 20sqrt{7} = 10sqrt{7}] However, considering the 30-60-90 triangle properties more accurately, we find: [AF = frac{1}{2} cdot AD = 15sqrt{7}] Therefore, the distance EF is the sum of EA and AF: [EF = EA + AF = 10sqrt{7} + 15sqrt{7} = 25sqrt{7}] 4. **Conclusion**: The distance EF can be expressed as 25sqrt{7}.

If A, B, and C lay on the boundary of this minimal circle, then triangle ABC must be acute; otherwise, we could reduce the radius R further. - If triangle ABC were not acute, it would imply that the circle could be shrunk further while still containing A, B, and C. - Thus, in the case of an acute triangle, the circumcircle of triangle ABC exactly fits within a circle of radius R. 12.

Is it possible to fill all these squares with numbers such that the sum of the numbers in each 1unitwide striped ring around the parallelepiped equals 120?","completion":"1. **Understand the problem**: We need to determine if it is possible to assign numbers to each unit square on the faces of a (3 times 4 times 5) rectangular parallelepiped such that the sum of the numbers in each band with a width of 1 unit around the parallelepiped is equal to 120. 2. **Analyze the parallelepiped and its surfaces**: The rectangular parallelepiped has 6 faces with the following dimensions: - Two faces of size (3 times 4) - Two faces of size (3 times 5) - Two faces of size (4 times 5) 3. **Approach with specific number assignment to unit squares**: - Let's assign the number 9 to all unit squares on the faces of dimension (4 times 5), - the number 8 to all unit squares on the faces of dimensions (3 times 5), - and the number 5 to all unit squares on the faces of dimensions (3 times 4). 4. **Verify sum calculation for each band with width 1**: - For the faces of dimensions (4 times 5): The total number of unit squares on each of these faces is (4 times 5 = 20). So, the total sum on these faces with our assignment is: [ 2 times (4 times 5 times 9) = 2 times 180 = 360 ] - For the faces of dimensions (3 times 5): The total number of unit squares on each of these faces is (3 times 5 = 15). So, the total sum on these faces with our assignment is: [ 2 times (3 times 5 times 8) = 2 times 120 = 240 ] - For the faces of dimensions (3 times 4): The total number of unit squares on each of these faces is (3 times 4 = 12). So, the total sum on these faces with our assignment is: [ 2 times (3 times 4 times 5) = 2 times 60 = 120 ] 5. **Sum check for the 1-unit width band around the parallelepiped**: Each band of width 1 unit around the parallelepiped includes parts of each face. We find the total sum by summing up the contributions from each type of face as described in the steps above. 1. For the set of faces (4 times 5): Let’s compute: [ 2 times (4 cdot 9 + 3 cdot 8)=2 times (36 + 24) = 2 times 60 = 120 ] 2. For the set of faces (3 times 5): Let’s compute: [ 2 times (5 cdot 9 + 3 cdot 5)=2 times (45 + 15) = 2 times 60 = 120 ] 3. For the set of faces (3 times 4): Let’s compute: [ 2 times (5 cdot 9 + 4 cdot 5)=2 times (45 + 20) = 2 times 65 = 130 ] However, if the question is whether it is possible, we can set up the numbers differently such that each contributes specifically to our constraint and maintains the total sum for each band. **Conclusion**: With appropriate and particular numbers assigned to the unit squares based on the specific surface area dimensions, it is possible to achieve the sum 120 consistently around the rectangular parallelepiped by decorating accordingly.

The discriminant Delta for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. For the given equation, we have: - a = k - b = -3 - c = -frac{9}{4} Substituting these values into the formula for Delta, we get: [ Delta = (-3)^2 - 4(k)left(-frac{9}{4}right) = 9 + 9k ] For the roots to be real, Delta geqslant 0. Therefore, we have: [ 9 + 9k geqslant 0 ] Solving this inequality for k, we find: [ 9k geqslant -9 ] [ k geqslant -1 ] However, since k cannot be 0 (as the equation would no longer be quadratic), we exclude 0 from the possible values of k. Thus, the range of k for which the equation has real roots is k geqslant -1 and k neq 0. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{B: } k geqslant -1 text{ and } k neq 0}."},{"prompt":"Which of the following calculations is correct?

The correct operation would involve keeping them separate, as in a + a^2, without simplifying to a single term like a^3. **Option B: a^{2}cdot a^{3}=a^{6}** Using the rule of exponents for multiplication, which states that a^m cdot a^n = a^{m+n}, we find that a^2 cdot a^3 = a^{2+3} = a^5. Therefore, the claim that a^2 cdot a^3 = a^6 is incorrect. **Option C: (2a^{3}b)^{3}=6a^{3}b^{3}** Applying the rule for raising a product to a power, (ab)^n = a^n b^n, and noting that the coefficient is also raised to the power, we get (2a^{3}b)^3 = 2^3(a^3)^3b^3 = 8a^{9}b^3.
