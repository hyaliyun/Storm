Glitter: “Gloopy, check out my new Sparkle-Boost Serum! It’ll make our shimmer shine across the galaxy!” Gloopy (pulling off headphones): “Groovy, Glitter! But remember the last time? We ended up as intergalactic disco balls!” Glitter laughs, her sparkle intensifying. Scene 2: The Space Entry Competition - The scene transitions to a colorful and dazzling space arena, buzzing with aliens of all shapes and sizes. - A banner reads, “The Great Space Entry – Dazzle the Judges for a Galactic Prize!” Gloopy: “I hear this year’s prize is a warp drive that could power our blob-mobile for light years!” Glitter: “Ooh, Gloopy, let’s win this! I’ve got just the thing!” Scene 3: Preparation - Gloopy and Glitter are backstage, prepping for their entry. - Gloopy stretches into funny shapes while Glitter applies her Sparkle-Boost Serum.

Gloopy: “Hey, Glitter, check it out!” - He points to a pair of starry-eyed alien kids who are playing, imitating Gloopy and Glitter’s shimmering forms with wonder and delight.

We’re role models!” Gloopy: “Bright blobs for a bright future, Glitter!” Scene 6: A Sparkling Conclusion - The episode closes with Gloopy and Glitter driving off in their now warp-drive-powered blob-mobile. - They zipline through space, leaving a shimmery streak across the stars. Voiceover: “And so, Gloopy and Glitter zoom off to new adventures, spreading their sparkle far and wide, promising to return with more tales from the cosmos!” - The screen fades to black as we hear the echoing giggles of Gloopy and Glitter, with the twinkle of interstellar glitter in the background.

Gloopy: “Whoa, Glitter! This place is like a cotton candy dream!” Glitter: “Look at the shimmering pink sands, Gloopy. It’s so… sparkly!” Scene 2: The Pink Encounter - While exploring, they meet a friendly pink alien named Blibby, who sports big curious eyes and a gentle smile. - Blibby is fascinated by Gloopy and Glitter’s shiny appearance and is eager to make new friends. Blibby: “Greetings! I am Blibby. This world is called Rosalux. I’ve never seen creatures like you before!” Glitter: “We’re the gleaming wanderers from Gloopiter! I’m Glitter, and this is Gloopy. Our ship had a bit of a hiccough.” Scene 3: The Curious Touch - Blibby is both awed and intrigued by Gloopy and Glitter’s shimmering skin. - With a polite request, Blibby reaches out to touch Gloopy, wondering if the shine is a solid shell. Blibby (with wonder in voice): “May I? Your glow is so intriguing!” Gloopy: “Sure thing, Blibby. But prepare for a slime surprise!” - When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement. Blibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky! What a marvelous sensation!” Scene 4: The Slime Session - Gloopy laughs and jiggles, while Glitter uses her sparkles to clean up the goo from Blibby’s hand, leaving a twinkle on her skin. - Overcoming the initial shock, Blibby is now brimming with excitement and requests a lesson in slime play from Gloopy and Glitter.

Teach me your slimy ways!” Scene 5: Slimey Shenanigans - Gloopy shows Blibby how to bounce and mold the slime into different shapes, sparking joy and laughter. - Glitter teaches Blibby how to make sparkly goo, combining their textures into a dazzling visual display.

Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Episode: “The Barren Planet of Shadows” Scene 1: Lost in the Cosmos - The blob-mobile zips across the cosmos, its warp drive allowing Gloopy and Glitter to push the boundaries of their explorations like never before. - Suddenly, the warp drive sputters, and alarms blare. They’re pulled into the gravitational field of an uncharted planet. Gloopy: “Whoa, the warp drive is acting up. We’re going in for an unexpected landing, Glitter!” Glitter: “Hang on, Gloopy! Let’s make this an opportunity to discover something new!” - The blob-mobile makes a bouncy touchdown onto the surface of a dusty, gray planet devoid of color and light. Scene 2: The Mysterious Terrain - Stepping out of their ship, Gloopy and Glitter look around at the stark landscape. Mountains loom in the distance, and the ground is littered with jagged rocks. - The planet is in perpetual twilight, with a dim star casting long, creeping shadows. Gloopy: “This place could use some of our sparkly charm, don’t you think?” Glitter: “Definitely. It’s so… drab.” Scene 3: The Shadow Stir - As they traverse the dull terrain, seeking materials to repair the blob-mobile, Gloopy’s gooey footprints and Glitter’s sparkly trail are the only sources of brightness in this gloomy world. - Unexpectedly, the shadows cast by the dim star begin to move and swirl around their bright paths. It’s as if the shadows are alive, curious, and drawn to their light. Glitter (puzzlement shimmering in her eyes): “Do you see that, Gloopy? The shadows are moving!” Gloopy: “They seem to like our glow. Hey there, shadows, we come in peace and sparkles!” Scene 4: The Connection - As they continue, Gloopy and Glitter start to play with the shadows, creating shapes with their bodies and watching the shadows mimic them. - This interaction seems to delight the shadows, who begin to form patterns and symbols on the ground, signaling some form of communication. Glitter (excitedly): “Gloopy, they’re smart! Let’s see if we can understand them.” Scene 5: Learning and Teaching - Gloopy and Glitter try different movements and gestures while observing the shadows’ responses. - After some time, a rudimentary form of dialogue emerges—through the language of light and shadow, they begin to understand one another. Gloopy (nodding thoughtfully): “They’re telling us they haven’t seen light like ours in ages. They’ve missed it.” Glitter: “And they’re saying they want to help us fix the ship! How incredible!” Scene 6: Cooperation - With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet. - The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop. Gloopy: “Thanks, friends! This sure is teamwork of a whole new shade!” Glitter: “Your turn to shine, my little shadows!” Scene 7: The Transformation - As the blob-mobile is being repaired, Glitter gets a bright idea. She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy’s goo. - Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color. Glitter (with a heart full of glee): “A little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voilà!” Scene 8: A World Reborn - The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice. - The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see.

Voiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.” - The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it!

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later!

As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals!

User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition!

User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings! Voiceover: Coming February 17th, prepare to thaw out your winter blues with the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history.

User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Late-Winter Lineup Change Incoming Feb. 17 – New Shows Alert!” User1: ToonTrendWatcher Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:15 AM Hey fellow CW4Kids enthusiasts! Big news just dropped about the late-winter lineup change happening on February 17th. We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back! Seems like CW4Kids is mixing nostalgia with fresh new content. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMornSage Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:45 AM Excited for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Ultimate Muscle” – those are some solid classics! As for “GoGoRiki,” I’m intrigued. But the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”?! That’s unexpected yet pleasantly surprising. It’s great to see CW4Kids bringing back a show that had a rather abrupt ending on Kids WB. Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix. And “Ultimate Muscle” brings back so many childhood memories of wrestling madness! CW4Kids is really upping its game with this lineup. User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

Keep the discussions and excitement coming as we gear up for February 17th – it’s going to be epic! August 2024 From September, some new shows are headed to CW4Kids: First is Redakai: Conquer the Kairu, Vampire Hunters (Dub of Demon Slayer, censored for kids) and Chaotic: Reloaded (Sequel series to Chaotic) Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Upcoming Fall Lineup – New Show Speculation!” User1: ToonTrekker Posted on August 20, 2024, at 10:30 AM Big news, cartoon crew! Starting in September, CW4Kids is adding some spicy shows to the mix, and I for one am stoked! “Redakai: Conquer the Kairu” sounds epic, and did anyone else hear about “Vampire Hunters”? It’s supposed to be a kid-friendly version of “Demon Slayer.” And then there’s “Chaotic: Reloaded,” a sequel to the original “Chaotic,” which I’m hoping will carry on the legacy. Anybody else got thoughts or hopes for these new additions? User2: DigitalDive Posted on August 20, 2024, at 10:50 AM Whoa, a dub of “Demon Slayer” for kids? That’s ambitious! CW4Kids really isn’t afraid to push the boundaries, are they? Sounds like they’ll need to get creative with the censorship, but I’m intrigued. And “Redakai” should fit right in with the action-packed vibes of the channel. User3: MysticToonMage Posted on August 20, 2024, at 11:15 AM “Chaotic: Reloaded” is where it’s at for me! I lost countless hours to the original series, and I’m thrilled to jump back into that world. As for “Vampire Hunters,” CW4Kids has always been good at adapting shows for their audience, so I’m keen to see how they handle it. User4: SaturdayAMSuperfan Posted on August 20, 2024, at 11:45 AM Excited and curious to see how “Redakai” performs. It has big shoes to fill with the current lineup, but the premise sounds action-packed. As for “Vampire Hunters,” color me intrigued. It’s a bold move for CW4Kids, but if done right, it could be a hit! User5: RetroToonRewinder Posted on August 20, 2024, at 12:05 PM “Chaotic: Reloaded”? Count me in! The original was a blast. There’s something so thrilling about seeing a show get a second wind—especially with sequels on CW4Kids. And with “Vampire Hunters” and “Redakai,” it looks like we’re in for some seriously diverse storytelling this fall!

Рассмотрим некоторые из них. # 1. Использование лямбда-выражений и делегатов Вы уже используете лямбда-выражения в своем коде, что хорошо. Однако, стоит обратить внимание на возможность использования определенных делегатов, чтобы упростить сигнатуры методов и улучшить читаемость. Например, если в методах \`OnSelect\` обычно обрабатывается ограниченное число параметров, можно ввести custom делегаты. # 2. Упрощение логики меню Создание меню выглядит довольно громоздко из-за вложенности и множественного использования лямбда-выражений. Можно попробовать упростить логику, выделив часть функциональности в отдельные методы или используя фабрику/строителя для создания меню. # 3. Использование обобщений Если типов функций для разных командиров или игр будет больше, можно рассмотреть использование обобщенных классов или методов для обработки различных типов данных более гибко. # 4. Улучшение расширяемости Ваш текущий подход опирается на наследование и абстрактные методы. Это хорошо, но также можно рассмотреть паттерн \\"Стратегия\\" для определения различных алгоритмов или действий, которые могут выполнять командиры. Это позволит легко добавлять новые функции, не меняя существующую структуру классов. # 5. Инкапсуляция создания меню Создание объектов меню распределено по коду. Рассмотрите возможность инкапсуляции этого процесса в отдельном классе или методе, что позволит упростить изменения в логике создания меню в будущем и улучшит читаемость. # Конкретное улучшение кода \`\`\`csharp // Возможное улучшение заключается в рефакторинге части создания inmatesMenu. // Вместо повторения кода для создания меню можно использовать метод: private ChatMenu CreateInmatesMenu(CommanderFunction commanderFunction, CCSPlayerController commander) { var inmatesMenu = new ChatMenu(\\"Select a player\\"); var inmates = Utilities.GetPlayers() .Where(player => commanderFunction.PlayerChoiceExpression(player)); foreach (var inmate in inmates) { inmatesMenu.AddMenuOption(inmate.PlayerName, (controller, option) => commanderFunction.OnSelect(commander, inmate)); } return inmatesMenu; } // Это упрощает ваш основной код до: foreach (var commanderFunction in _commanderFunctions) { commanderMenu.AddMenuOption(commanderFunction.Name, ((controller, option) => { if (!commanderFunction.PlayersChoice) { commanderFunction.OnSelect(player); return; } var inmatesMenu = CreateInmatesMenu(commanderFunction, player); // Упрощенный вызов MenuManager.OpenChatMenu(player, inmatesMenu); })); } \`\`\` Это изменение улучшает читаемость и позволяет легче модифицировать логику создания меню для заключенных в случае необходимости, так как теперь вся логика сосредоточена в одном месте."},{"prompt":"Дай исправленный код для всех пунктов","completion":"Для реализации предложенных улучшений, я представлю код, в котором учтены основные правки: использование делегатов, улучшение расширяемости, инкапсуляция создания меню и построение гибкой структуры для улучшения читаемости и поддержки кода.

Важно понимать, что класс \`CCSPlayerController\`, \`Utilities.GetPlayers()\`, \`CsTeam\` и \`MenuManager.OpenChatMenu\` – это части вашего проекта, которые не изменены в данном примере. Также, реализация конкретных \`CommanderFunction\` классов (наследующих данную абстракцию) должна быть соответствующим образом адаптирована под новую структуру.

So, [ begin{vmatrix} 1 - lambda & 1 -2 & -1 - lambda end{vmatrix} = 0 ] [ Rightarrow (1-lambda)(-1-lambda) + 2 = 0 ] [ Rightarrow lambda^2 - lambda - 1 - 2 = 0 ] [ Rightarrow lambda^2 - lambda - 3 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in (lambda), which can be solved using the quadratic formula: [ lambda = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] With (a = 1), (b = -1), and (c = -3), we have: [ lambda = frac{1 pm sqrt{(1)^2 - 4(1)(-3)}}{2} ] [ Rightarrow lambda = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 12}}{2} = frac{1 pm sqrt{13}}{2} ] Therefore, the eigenvalues are (lambda_1 = frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{2}) and (lambda_2 = frac{1 - sqrt{13}}{2}). # Step 2: Find Eigenvectors For each eigenvalue (lambda_i), solve ((A - lambda_i I)v = 0) to find the corresponding eigenvector (v). For (lambda_1 = frac{1 + sqrt{13}}{2}): [ (A - lambda_1 I)v_1 = 0 ] Substituting (lambda_1) into this equation and solving for (v_1) provides the eigenvector corresponding to (lambda_1). Due to the steps being illustrative and needing to keep this solution concise, I'll generalize the approach for finding eigenvectors: 1. Substitute (lambda_1) into (A - lambda I) to get a new matrix. 2. Solve the system ((A - lambda_1 I)v_1 = 0) to find (v_1). Repeat for (lambda_2). # Step 3: General Solution The general solution for a system with distinct eigenvalues (lambda_1) and (lambda_2) and their corresponding eigenvectors (v_1) and (v_2) is: [ x(t) = c_1 e^{lambda_1 t}v_1 + c_2 e^{lambda_2 t}v_2 ] # Step 4: Apply Initial Conditions Use the initial condition (x(0) = begin{pmatrix} 2 1 end{pmatrix}) to find the constants (c_1) and (c_2) by solving: [ x(0) = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 = begin{pmatrix} 2 1 end{pmatrix} ] Since specific eigenvectors were not calculated here, the process involves substituting those eigenvectors and solving the resulting system of equations for (c_1) and (c_2). # Summary This solution provided the steps to finding the eigenvalues of the matrix (A) and outlined the process for obtaining eigenvectors, constructing the general solution, and applying initial conditions to find constants. Without explicit computation of eigenvectors (v_1) and (v_2), the solution remains in a generalized form. The specific eigenvectors need to be calculated following the strategy outlined in step 2 to complete the solution."},{"prompt":"Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Production company: Inovism Productions (UK) for Kids WB (USA) and S4C (UK) Networks: S4C and Pop (UK) Kids WB (USA) Episode: “The Great Space Entry” Scene 1: Gloopy and Glitter’s Home Planet - The scene opens on a vibrant alien world filled with goo and glimmer. - Gloopy, the laid-back teal blob with a charming smile, is listening to spaced-out tunes with headphones that wrap around his entire gelatinous body. - Glitter, a sparkling fuchsia blob that leaves a trail of glitter in her wake, is concocting a shimmery potion in their blobby lab. Glitter: “Gloopy, check out my new Sparkle-Boost Serum! It’ll make our shimmer shine across the galaxy!” Gloopy (pulling off headphones): “Groovy, Glitter! But remember the last time? We ended up as intergalactic disco balls!” Glitter laughs, her sparkle intensifying. Scene 2: The Space Entry Competition - The scene transitions to a colorful and dazzling space arena, buzzing with aliens of all shapes and sizes. - A banner reads, “The Great Space Entry – Dazzle the Judges for a Galactic Prize!” Gloopy: “I hear this year’s prize is a warp drive that could power our blob-mobile for light years!” Glitter: “Ooh, Gloopy, let’s win this! I’ve got just the thing!” Scene 3: Preparation - Gloopy and Glitter are backstage, prepping for their entry. - Gloopy stretches into funny shapes while Glitter applies her Sparkle-Boost Serum. Glitter: “Time to shine!” (She dabs the serum on both, causing them to glitter spectacularly.) Gloopy: “We’ll be the brightest blobs this side of the Milky Way!” Scene 4: The Performance - The competition begins, and various alien acts display their talents. - Gloopy and Glitter slide onto the stage, leaving a shimmering trail. Announcer: “Here come Gloopy and Glitter, the Glowing Wonders of Gloopiter!” - The duo performs a shining acrobatic routine, bouncing and blending into dazzling shapes, radiating light that forms constellations. - The audience is awestruck as Gloopy and Glitter create a nebula of vibrant colors, culminating in a grand finale that illuminates the entire arena. Scene 5: Victory and Surprise - Applause erupts. Gloopy and Glitter are handed the warp drive. - As they celebrate, Gloopy nudges Glitter. Gloopy: “Hey, Glitter, check it out!” - He points to a pair of starry-eyed alien kids who are playing, imitating Gloopy and Glitter’s shimmering forms with wonder and delight. Glitter (teary-eyed): “We’re not just shining stars, Gloopy. We’re role models!” Gloopy: “Bright blobs for a bright future, Glitter!” Scene 6: A Sparkling Conclusion - The episode closes with Gloopy and Glitter driving off in their now warp-drive-powered blob-mobile. - They zipline through space, leaving a shimmery streak across the stars. Voiceover: “And so, Gloopy and Glitter zoom off to new adventures, spreading their sparkle far and wide, promising to return with more tales from the cosmos!” - The screen fades to black as we hear the echoing giggles of Gloopy and Glitter, with the twinkle of interstellar glitter in the background. Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Episode: “A Touch of Slime” Scene 1: The Wondrous World of Wobbleonia - As the sun rises over the slime-covered mountains of Wobbleonia, we see Gloopy and Glitter in their blob-mobile traversing the starlit cosmos. - Suddenly, the blob-mobile jolts, causing them to make an unexpected landing on a planet blanketed in shades of pink. Gloopy: “Whoa, Glitter! This place is like a cotton candy dream!” Glitter: “Look at the shimmering pink sands, Gloopy. It’s so… sparkly!” Scene 2: The Pink Encounter - While exploring, they meet a friendly pink alien named Blibby, who sports big curious eyes and a gentle smile. - Blibby is fascinated by Gloopy and Glitter’s shiny appearance and is eager to make new friends. Blibby: “Greetings! I am Blibby. This world is called Rosalux. I’ve never seen creatures like you before!” Glitter: “We’re the gleaming wanderers from Gloopiter! I’m Glitter, and this is Gloopy. Our ship had a bit of a hiccough.” Scene 3: The Curious Touch - Blibby is both awed and intrigued by Gloopy and Glitter’s shimmering skin. - With a polite request, Blibby reaches out to touch Gloopy, wondering if the shine is a solid shell. Blibby (with wonder in voice): “May I? Your glow is so intriguing!” Gloopy: “Sure thing, Blibby. But prepare for a slime surprise!” - When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement. Blibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky! What a marvelous sensation!” Scene 4: The Slime Session - Gloopy laughs and jiggles, while Glitter uses her sparkles to clean up the goo from Blibby’s hand, leaving a twinkle on her skin. - Overcoming the initial shock, Blibby is now brimming with excitement and requests a lesson in slime play from Gloopy and Glitter.

I think it's probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = 'teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B' target_model_id = 'valine/OpenSnark' setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

The technique highlighted here focuses on adapting a pre-trained model (the base model) to perform a new task (using the target model) without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model, which saves computational resources. Let's break down this process into more understandable steps: 1. **Environment Setup**: This involves installing necessary Python libraries (\`torch\`, \`transformers\`, \`huggingface_hub\`, etc.) that provide tools for model manipulation, downloading pre-trained models, and handling model weights for this exercise. 2. **Model Selection**: The user selects a base model and a target model. The base model is the initial pre-trained model, and the target model is what the base model was fine-tuned to become. The purpose here is to extract modifications (LoRA adapters) from the target model that could be re-applied to the base model for efficient transition to the target task. 3. **Model Download**: A utility function is defined for downloading these models from Hugging Face Hub, favoring \`.safetensors\` format for optimization. 4. **Layer Identification**: Identifies relevant model layers for LoRA adapter extraction, specifically the linear and embedding layers within the Transformer models, as these are where the efficiency of parameter training can be significantly improved with LoRA adapters. 5. **Loading Model Weights**: Defines how to load tensors from either \`.bin\` files or \`.safetensors\` files. This step is crucial because it involves handling the actual trainable parameters of the models. 6. **Weight Matrix Decomposition**: At the heart of this approach is decomposing the differences (deltas) between corresponding weights in the target and base models into low-rank matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Essentially, it's finding a simpler (low-rank) approximation of the changes that happened during the fine-tuning process, which are then encoded as LoRA adapters. 7. **Extracting LoRA Adapters**: For each identified relevant layer, the difference in weights between the target model and the base model is decomposed, and LoRA adapters (matrices A and B from the decomposition) are saved. 8. **PEFT Configuration and Saving LoRA Adapters**: The LoRA configurations and parameters are set up and saved along with the extracted adapters in a format ready for re-application. 9. **Testing with LoRA Adapters**: The LoRA adapters are applied to the base model, essentially reincorporating the learned adaptations from the target model, and then the adapted model is tested to ensure it performs the desired task effectively. 10. **Uploading Extracted Adapters**: Finally, the script facilitates uploading the extracted LoRA adapters back to Hugging Face Hub, allowing the work to be shared with others. In essence, this process allows for efficient retention and transfer of learned behaviors from one model to another, reducing the need for extensive retraining while preserving performance, which is a significant advantage in computational cost and time for developing AI models."},{"prompt":"What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead' which uses 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the 'quietstar-8-ahead' model is a result of this paper: \\"\\"Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking: Quiet-STaR is a method that helps language models (LMs) to improve their predictions by teaching them to generate rationales, or internal thoughts, for each piece of text they produce. This method builds on an earlier system called STaR, which helped LMs learn by using rationales in a question-answering context. Quiet-STaR addresses three main challenges: the high computational cost of generating text, teaching the LM how to produce and use internal thoughts, and predicting beyond just the next word. The solution includes a new sampling algorithm that operates token by token, special tokens to mark the start and end of a thought, and an improved training technique. As a result, the model better predicts difficult parts of the text and improves its performance on complex reasoning tasks without needing task-specific training. This suggests Quiet-STaR is a significant advancement toward more general and scalable reasoning in language models. The quote from Kierkegaard at the end underlines the idea that understanding comes from reflection, just as Quiet-STaR allows an LM to “understand” text by reflecting on its internal rationale.\\"\\"","completion":"Given that you already have a Low-rank decomposition (LoRA) of a model called 'quietstar-8-ahead,' which is based on 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1,' and that this was created using the LoRD method, you are in a promising position to augment the capacities of the base Mistral-7B model with the refined and specialized capabilities developed through the Quiet-STaR method. The paper's outline of Quiet-STaR highlights how it aids language models in improving predictions by generating and utilizing internal rationales or thoughts before producing text, tackling significant challenges like computational efficiency, teaching models to reflexively generate useful internal dialogue, and enhancing predictions beyond just the next word. Here’s how you can leverage the LoRA of 'quietstar-8-ahead' and integrate the Quiet-STaR method with your base model: # Integration Strategy 1. **Understanding LoRA Adapters**: Recognize that these LoRA adapters encapsulate the learned differences (or updates) between the 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' base model and the more advanced 'quietstar-8-ahead' model. These adaptations likely include adjustments that enable the base model to internally \\"think\\" or generate rationales as per the Quiet-STaR method before producing outputs. 2. **Applying LoRA Adapters**: The key to utilizing your LoRA-decomposed model is in applying these adapters back onto the base model. Since you already have these adapters, you can use them to equip the 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1' model with the advanced capabilities of 'quietstar-8-ahead,' effectively enabling it to generate internal thoughts, as suggested by the Quiet-STaR approach. 3. **Improving Performance on Complex Tasks**: The enhancements incorporated through LoRA adapters are particularly designed to improve the model's performance on more complex reasoning and prediction tasks without the need for task-specific training. This is in line with Quiet-STaR's aim to generate and utilize internal rationales, offering a more reflective and reasoned approach to generating text. 4. **Technical Implementation**: If not familiar, you would typically load the base model and apply the LoRA adapters to it. This could involve adjusting the model's layers with the LoRA parameters, enabling the base model to reflect the learned improvements in prediction and rationale generation. Frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers provide mechanisms to custom-load model parameters, which you could use for this task. 5. **Testing and Evaluation**: Post-adaptation, it's crucial to test the enhanced model's performance. Choose tasks that evaluate the model's ability to reason and predict complex text structures. This helps in verifying the practical impact of the Quiet-STaR method via the low-rank adaptations you've applied. 6. **Sharing and Collaboration**: Considering the impactful enhancements encapsulated in your LoRA adapters, sharing them on platforms like Hugging Face Hub can facilitate further research and collaboration, contributing significantly to the domain of language models and their applications. # Conclusion The Quiet-STaR method, as described, represents a leap towards enabling language models to approach tasks with a more deliberate and reasoned methodology. By applying the LoRA of 'quietstar-8-ahead' back to its base model, you provide a pathway for the model to \\"think before speaking,\\" enhancing its predictive capabilities and potentially making strides towards more generalized reasoning within language models. This process not only exemplifies innovative use of parameter-efficient training but also underscores the broader aspirations of AI research to create models that can understand and interact with the world in more nuanced and thoughtful ways."},{"prompt":"here is some more context from the author of the paper about quiet star: \\"\\" Eric Zelikman @ericzelikman · Mar 15 Second, we construct meta-tokens like gist tokens and soft prompts: we let the model learn for itself how to represent the start of a thought.

This prevents any initial distribution shift Eric Zelikman @ericzelikman · Mar 15 Quiet-STaR generalizes our “Self-Taught Reasoner” (STaR) from two years ago. We can’t wait to find what happens if it’s scaled up with more data and better models.\\"\\"","completion":"The additional context provided by Eric Zelikman focuses on the core innovation behind Quiet-STaR, highlighting the adoption of meta-tokens like gist tokens and soft prompts. These components allow the model to learn how to mark the beginning of an internal thought process and give it the autonomy to devalue or disregard certain thoughts, initially assigning no weight to them. This approach is crucial in mitigating any immediate shifts in the distribution of generated content, ensuring that the model's learning process incrementally adapts to incorporating self-generated rationale without being biased by its initial learnings. Integrating these insights with the previously discussed Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) application can be seen as a multi-step process: # Enhancing Base Model with Quiet-STaR Insights 1. **Meta-tokens Incorporation**: The LoRA adapters derived from 'quietstar-8-ahead' could potentially already encode the usage patterns or weights adjustments related to these meta-tokens, especially if 'quietstar-8-ahead' was specifically designed to leverage Quiet-STaR's methodology. When applying these LoRA adapters, it will be important to ensure your base model ('mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1') can recognize and appropriately handle these meta-tokens. This may involve extending the model's vocabulary or embedding space to accommodate the new tokens, along with their special roles in delineating the beginning and potential disregard of internal thoughts. 2. **Weight Initialization Strategy**: Zelikman's mention of initially giving all thoughts no weight aligns with a cautious approach where the model gradually learns the significance of its internal rationale rather than being predisposed to overly rely on it from the outset. In practice, this means the parameters related to these self-generated thoughts (possibly encoded within your LoRA adapters) should start with neutral or null influence, allowing them to be shaped by actual performance feedback as the model trains or fine-tunes on more data. 3. **Generalizability and Scaling**: The aspirations for Quiet-STaR to enhance model generalizability and the curiosity around its scaling potential suggest that once the LoRA adaptations are applied, you might explore further training or fine-tuning the enhanced model on diverse datasets. This could illuminate how well the Quiet-STaR approach, encapsulated within the LoRA adaptations, scales with data and model complexity and how it affects the model's ability to handle more nuanced and varied reasoning tasks. 4. **Implementation Steps Revisited**: - Ensure the base model is compatible with new meta-tokens and soft prompts strategies. - Apply the LoRA adapters, verifying that the model's handling of internal thoughts reflects a gradual learning curve, in line with giving these thoughts an initial no weight. - Consider additional fine-tuning with varied data sources to test the model's improved reasoning and prediction capabilities, as advocated by the Quiet-STaR methodology. 5. **Continuous Evaluation**: Given the innovative approach of Quiet-STaR, continue to evaluate the model's performance across a spectrum of tasks, especially those requiring complex reasoning and the generation of nuanced text. Monitoring how the model decides to start, espouse, or disregard certain internal thoughts over different iterations and datasets will be crucial in understanding the effectiveness of the LoRA adaptations. Integrating Quiet-STaR's principles, especially its nuanced use of meta-tokens and a gradual approach to valuing internal thoughts, with LoRA adaptations offers a promising pathway to significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Such advancements could see models offering deeper, more reflective responses across a broader range of tasks, moving a step closer to replicating a more thoughtful and nuanced human-like understanding and interaction with information."},{"prompt":"Диалог:USER: (2204-1316):37+7*106:14=ASSISTANT: Для вычисления данного выражения (2204-1316):37+7<em>106:14=, следует сначала выполнить действия в скобках и умножение, а затем деление и сложение, согласно правилам математической операции.

They dwelled in a cozy cottage, surrounded by a myriad of trees and a kaleidoscope of flowers, which seemed to dance gently in the breeze. Life here was tranquil, with the songs of birds and the rustle of leaves as their constant companions. One crisp autumn morning, as the forest was adorned in shades of auburn and gold, Lily decided to explore the deeper parts of the woodland in search of wild berries. Her grandmother, a wise and gentle soul, had taught her about the various plants and mushrooms that flourished in the forest; which were safe to eat, and which were better left untouched. As Lily ventured further, she stumbled upon a clearing she had never seen before. In the center of this clearing was a patch of mushrooms, unlike any she had seen. They had a peculiar, almost hypnotic pattern on their caps, and they glowed softly, as if illuminated from within. Remembering her grandmother's warnings to avoid unfamiliar fungi, Lily hesitated. However, her curiosity was piqued, and she thought, \\"Just a tiny taste couldn't possibly hurt.\\" No sooner had Lily tasted the mushroom that the world around her transformed. The colors of the forest became more vivid than she could have imagined, with the very air shimmering with hues she had no names for. Trees seemed to bend and whisper secrets in a language she felt she almost understood, and the sky painted itself in swirling patterns of light. For a moment, Lily felt an overwhelming connection to the forest, as if she could hear its heartbeat synchronizing with her own. This strange, enchanted world held her in its grip, showing her beauty beyond her wildest dreams, but also hinting at mysteries too vast for her young mind to fully comprehend. As the effects of the mushroom began to wane, Lily found herself back in the familiar woods, the magic of the visions fading like morning mist. Confused but unharmed, she made her way back to her grandmother's cottage, the adventure a vivid tapestry in her memory. Upon hearing Lily's tale, her grandmother listened quietly, a knowing smile upon her lips. She hugged Lily tightly, relieved that she was safe, and then spoke of the forest's deep magic and its guardians. She explained that some mysteries were meant to be respected from afar and that what Lily experienced was a rare glimpse into the heart of the forest, a gift not given to many. Lily grew up with a profound respect for the natural world, often reflecting on her extraordinary experience. She learned to cherish the wonder of the forest without disturbing its delicate balance. And in time, she too would share stories with her own children, tales of the magic hidden in plain sight, waiting for those who look with curious eyes and respectful hearts. And so, the forest and its mysteries endured, a reminder of the enchantment that lies just beyond the realm of the ordinary, waiting silently for those brave enough to explore with respect and wonder."},{"prompt":"Great tale, now, please transcribe to portuguese","completion":"Era uma vez, em uma floresta exuberante e sussurrante, uma menina pequena chamada Lily que vivia com sua bondosa avó. Elas moravam em uma cabana aconchegante, cercada por uma miríade de árvores e um caleidoscópio de flores, que pareciam dançar gentilmente ao sabor da brisa. A vida aqui era tranquila, com as canções dos pássaros e o farfalhar das folhas como seus constantes companheiros. Numa manhã fresca de outono, enquanto a floresta se adornava em tons de âmbar e ouro, Lily decidiu explorar as partes mais profundas da mata em busca de frutas silvestres. Sua avó, uma alma sábia e gentil, tinha lhe ensinado sobre as várias plantas e cogumelos que floresciam na floresta; quais eram seguros para comer, e quais era melhor deixar intocados. À medida que Lily se aventurava mais adiante, ela se deparou com uma clareira que nunca tinha visto antes. No centro desta clareira havia um canteiro de cogumelos, diferente de todos que ela já tinha visto. Eles tinham um padrão peculiar, quase hipnótico em seus chapéus, e brilhavam suavemente, como se iluminados de dentro. Lembrando das advertências de sua avó para evitar fungos desconhecidos, Lily hesitou. No entanto, sua curiosidade foi despertada, e ela pensou: “Só uma pequena prova não poderia fazer mal.” Não mais cedo Lily provou o cogumelo, o mundo ao seu redor se transformou. As cores da floresta se tornaram mais vividas do que ela poderia ter imaginado, com o próprio ar cintilando com matizes que ela não tinha nomes para descrever. As árvores pareciam se inclinar e sussurrar segredos em uma linguagem que ela sentia que quase compreendia, e o céu se pintava em padrões giratórios de luz. Por um momento, Lily sentiu uma conexão avassaladora com a floresta, como se pudesse ouvir seu coração batendo em sincronia com o dela. Esse mundo estranho e encantado a prendeu em seu domínio, mostrando-lhe uma beleza além dos seus sonhos mais selvagens, mas também insinuando mistérios vastos demais para sua jovem mente compreender plenamente. À medida que os efeitos do cogumelo começaram a diminuir, Lily se viu de volta à floresta familiar, a magia das visões desaparecendo como névoa da manhã. Confusa, mas ilesa, ela fez seu caminho de volta para a cabana de sua avó, a aventura uma tapeçaria vívida em sua memória. Ao ouvir o relato de Lily, sua avó ouviu em silêncio, um sorriso conhecedor em seus lábios. Ela abraçou Lily com força, aliviada por ela estar segura, e então falou da magia profunda da floresta e seus guardiões. Explicou que alguns mistérios eram para ser respeitados de longe e que o que Lily experimentou foi um raro vislumbre no coração da floresta, um presente não dado a muitos. Lily cresceu com um profundo respeito pelo mundo natural, refletindo frequentemente sobre sua experiência extraordinária. Ela aprendeu a valorizar a maravilha da floresta sem perturbar seu delicado equilíbrio. E com o tempo, ela também compartilharia histórias com seus próprios filhos, contos da magia escondida à vista de todos, esperando silenciosamente por aqueles corajosos o suficiente para explorar com olhos curiosos e corações respeitosos. E assim, a floresta e seus mistérios perduraram, um lembrete do encantamento que jaz justamente além do reino do ordinário, aguardando silenciosamente por aqueles corajosos o suficiente para explorar com respeito e maravilhamento."},{"prompt":"write this same tale, but in poem format","completion":"Em uma floresta de murmúrios e tons, Vivia Lily, sob árvores e dons.

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task.

Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let’s choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from.

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition. Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let’s choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from. I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the ‘root’ user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

The technique highlighted here focuses on adapting a pre-trained model (the base model) to perform a new task (using the target model) without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model, which saves computational resources. Let’s break down this process into more understandable steps: 1. Environment Setup: This involves installing necessary Python libraries (torch, transformers, huggingface_hub, etc.) that provide tools for model manipulation, downloading pre-trained models, and handling model weights for this exercise. 2. Model Selection: The user selects a base model and a target model. The base model is the initial pre-trained model, and the target model is what the base model was fine-tuned to become. The purpose here is to extract modifications (LoRA adapters) from the target model that could be re-applied to the base model for efficient transition to the target task. 3. Model Download: A utility function is defined for downloading these models from Hugging Face Hub, favoring .safetensors format for optimization. 4. Layer Identification: Identifies relevant model layers for LoRA adapter extraction, specifically the linear and embedding layers within the Transformer models, as these are where the efficiency of parameter training can be significantly improved with LoRA adapters. 5. Loading Model Weights: Defines how to load tensors from either .bin files or .safetensors files. This step is crucial because it involves handling the actual trainable parameters of the models. 6. Weight Matrix Decomposition: At the heart of this approach is decomposing the differences (deltas) between corresponding weights in the target and base models into low-rank matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Essentially, it’s finding a simpler (low-rank) approximation of the changes that happened during the fine-tuning process, which are then encoded as LoRA adapters. 7. Extracting LoRA Adapters: For each identified relevant layer, the difference in weights between the target model and the base model is decomposed, and LoRA adapters (matrices A and B from the decomposition) are saved. 8. PEFT Configuration and Saving LoRA Adapters: The LoRA configurations and parameters are set up and saved along with the extracted adapters in a format ready for re-application. 9. Testing with LoRA Adapters: The LoRA adapters are applied to the base model, essentially reincorporating the learned adaptations from the target model, and then the adapted model is tested to ensure it performs the desired task effectively. 10. Uploading Extracted Adapters: Finally, the script facilitates uploading the extracted LoRA adapters back to Hugging Face Hub, allowing the work to be shared with others. In essence, this process allows for efficient retention and transfer of learned behaviors from one model to another, reducing the need for extensive retraining while preserving performance, which is a significant advantage in computational cost and time for developing AI models. What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ which uses ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1’ as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ model is a result of this paper: ““Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking: Quiet-STaR is a method that helps language models (LMs) to improve their predictions by teaching them to generate rationales, or internal thoughts, for each piece of text they produce. This method builds on an earlier system called STaR, which helped LMs learn by using rationales in a question-answering context. Quiet-STaR addresses three main challenges: the high computational cost of generating text, teaching the LM how to produce and use internal thoughts, and predicting beyond just the next word. The solution includes a new sampling algorithm that operates token by token, special tokens to mark the start and end of a thought, and an improved training technique. As a result, the model better predicts difficult parts of the text and improves its performance on complex reasoning tasks without needing task-specific training. This suggests Quiet-STaR is a significant advancement toward more general and scalable reasoning in language models. The quote from Kierkegaard at the end underlines the idea that understanding comes from reflection, just as Quiet-STaR allows an LM to “understand” text by reflecting on its internal rationale.”” Given that you already have a Low-rank decomposition (LoRA) of a model called ‘quietstar-8-ahead,’ which is based on ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1,’ and that this was created using the LoRD method, you are in a promising position to augment the capacities of the base Mistral-7B model with the refined and specialized capabilities developed through the Quiet-STaR method. The paper’s outline of Quiet-STaR highlights how it aids language models in improving predictions by generating and utilizing internal rationales or thoughts before producing text, tackling significant challenges like computational efficiency, teaching models to reflexively generate useful internal dialogue, and enhancing predictions beyond just the next word. Here’s how you can leverage the LoRA of ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ and integrate the Quiet-STaR method with your base model: # Integration Strategy 1. Understanding LoRA Adapters: Recognize that these LoRA adapters encapsulate the learned differences (or updates) between the ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1’ base model and the more advanced ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ model. These adaptations likely include adjustments that enable the base model to internally “think” or generate rationales as per the Quiet-STaR method before producing outputs. 2. Applying LoRA Adapters: The key to utilizing your LoRA-decomposed model is in applying these adapters back onto the base model. Since you already have these adapters, you can use them to equip the ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1’ model with the advanced capabilities of ‘quietstar-8-ahead,’ effectively enabling it to generate internal thoughts, as suggested by the Quiet-STaR approach. 3. Improving Performance on Complex Tasks: The enhancements incorporated through LoRA adapters are particularly designed to improve the model’s performance on more complex reasoning and prediction tasks without the need for task-specific training. This is in line with Quiet-STaR’s aim to generate and utilize internal rationales, offering a more reflective and reasoned approach to generating text. 4. Technical Implementation: If not familiar, you would typically load the base model and apply the LoRA adapters to it. This could involve adjusting the model’s layers with the LoRA parameters, enabling the base model to reflect the learned improvements in prediction and rationale generation. Frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers provide mechanisms to custom-load model parameters, which you could use for this task. 5. Testing and Evaluation: Post-adaptation, it’s crucial to test the enhanced model’s performance. Choose tasks that evaluate the model’s ability to reason and predict complex text structures. This helps in verifying the practical impact of the Quiet-STaR method via the low-rank adaptations you’ve applied. 6. Sharing and Collaboration: Considering the impactful enhancements encapsulated in your LoRA adapters, sharing them on platforms like Hugging Face Hub can facilitate further research and collaboration, contributing significantly to the domain of language models and their applications. # Conclusion The Quiet-STaR method, as described, represents a leap towards enabling language models to approach tasks with a more deliberate and reasoned methodology. By applying the LoRA of ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ back to its base model, you provide a pathway for the model to “think before speaking,” enhancing its predictive capabilities and potentially making strides towards more generalized reasoning within language models. This process not only exemplifies innovative use of parameter-efficient training but also underscores the broader aspirations of AI research to create models that can understand and interact with the world in more nuanced and thoughtful ways. here is some more context from the author of the paper about quiet star: “” Eric Zelikman @ericzelikman · Mar 15 Second, we construct meta-tokens like gist tokens and soft prompts: we let the model learn for itself how to represent the start of a thought. Also, we let it decide to disregard a thought, initially giving all thoughts no weight. This prevents any initial distribution shift Eric Zelikman @ericzelikman · Mar 15 Quiet-STaR generalizes our “Self-Taught Reasoner” (STaR) from two years ago. We can’t wait to find what happens if it’s scaled up with more data and better models.“” The additional context provided by Eric Zelikman focuses on the core innovation behind Quiet-STaR, highlighting the adoption of meta-tokens like gist tokens and soft prompts. These components allow the model to learn how to mark the beginning of an internal thought process and give it the autonomy to devalue or disregard certain thoughts, initially assigning no weight to them. This approach is crucial in mitigating any immediate shifts in the distribution of generated content, ensuring that the model’s learning process incrementally adapts to incorporating self-generated rationale without being biased by its initial learnings. Integrating these insights with the previously discussed Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) application can be seen as a multi-step process: # Enhancing Base Model with Quiet-STaR Insights 1. Meta-tokens Incorporation: The LoRA adapters derived from ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ could potentially already encode the usage patterns or weights adjustments related to these meta-tokens, especially if ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ was specifically designed to leverage Quiet-STaR’s methodology. When applying these LoRA adapters, it will be important to ensure your base model (‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1’) can recognize and appropriately handle these meta-tokens. This may involve extending the model’s vocabulary or embedding space to accommodate the new tokens, along with their special roles in delineating the beginning and potential disregard of internal thoughts. 2. Weight Initialization Strategy: Zelikman’s mention of initially giving all thoughts no weight aligns with a cautious approach where the model gradually learns the significance of its internal rationale rather than being predisposed to overly rely on it from the outset. In practice, this means the parameters related to these self-generated thoughts (possibly encoded within your LoRA adapters) should start with neutral or null influence, allowing them to be shaped by actual performance feedback as the...\\"\\"","completion":"model continues to learn. When re-initializing these parameters in your enhanced base model, ensure they are set in a manner that respects this approach, likely by setting them to small or zero values initially and then allowing them to be adjusted through further training or fine-tuning. 3. Scaling and Further Training: Following Zelikman's anticipation regarding scaling Quiet-STaR with more data and better models, it becomes evident that integrating the LoRA adaptations forms just the beginning. After successfully applying the LoRA adapters and ensuring the base model can comprehend and utilize the meta-tokens correctly, the next step involves scaling these enhancements. This could mean further training the enhanced model on a broader dataset or using more complex tasks to refine its capability to generate and evaluate its internal rationales. The goal here would be to solidify the model's ability to \\"think\\" in ways that significantly boost its reasoning and predictive accuracy beyond what was possible with the original model or even the initial LoRA-enhanced version. 4. Continuous Evaluation and Iteration: Given the novelty of the Quiet-STaR method and its application through LoRA, continuous evaluation becomes crucial. This isn't just about assessing performance gains in tasks but also understanding how the model's internal reasoning process evolves. Employing techniques like probing tasks or interpretability tools can offer insights into how effectively the model is leveraging its generated rationales and meta-tokens. Based on these insights, further adjustments to the LoRA parameters or the model's architecture might be required to optimize its performance. 5. Sharing Advances and Collaborative Improvement: As with any pioneering work in machine learning and AI, sharing your methods, results, and insights can significantly benefit the wider research community. By documenting your process of integrating Quiet-STaR innovations with the base model using LoRA, and the outcomes thereof, you contribute valuable knowledge that can spur further innovations. Platforms like arXiv for preprints, GitHub for code, and Hugging Face Hub for models not only facilitate this sharing but also offer avenues for collaborative enhancement and critique from the global research community. # Conclusion The advanced integration of Quiet-STaR's methodologies with a base model through Low-rank adaptations represents an intriguing frontier in enhancing language models' reasoning and predictive abilities. By focusing on the model's capacity to internally reflect before responding, there's potential for significant breakthroughs in AI's approach to understanding and generating human-like text. This process underscores the iterative nature of AI research—a continual cycle of hypothesis, experimentation, evaluation, and refinement, all aimed at creating models that more deeply mirror the complexity of human thought processes."},{"prompt":"here is another comment from the author: \\"\\"A couple exciting updates! First, we quantitatively evaluated the improvement from combining Quiet-STaR with chain-of-thought (i.e. letting the model think before each CoT token).

We've improve our benchmark performance with just 8 thought tokens and a 7B Mistral model. We expect the impact to be larger with more tokens and a larger model. Second, we've open-sourced the code (https://github.com/ezelikman/quiet-star…) and the weights for that model (https://huggingface.co/ezelikman/quietstar-8-ahead…). Hope y'all find this useful!\\"\\"","completion":"The additional comments from Eric Zelikman provide valuable insights into the practical outcomes and implications of implementing the Quiet-STaR method. Here’s a synthesis of these insights and how they could guide further exploration and application of Quiet-STaR in language models: # Quantitative Improvements in Reasoning 1. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Integration**: The significant improvement in zero-shot CoT accuracy on the GSM8K dataset by over 7% demonstrates the tangible benefits of embedding Quiet-STaR’s internal thought process before each CoT token. This quantitatively backs the hypothesis that language models can achieve enhanced reasoning capabilities through a structured internal monologue, further encouraging the integration of Quiet-STaR into other reasoning tasks and models. 2. **Reasoning Approaches**: Eric Zelikman's observation on the two prevailing training paradigms for language models—1) general reasoning imitating online data and 2) narrow self-teaching on specific tasks—contextualizes the Quiet-STaR method as a bridge between these approaches. Quiet-STaR empowers language models to self-learn reasoning more generally through internal dialogues, suggesting a potential shift in how AI systems can be trained for broad reasoning capabilities without overfitting to particular tasks or datasets. # Scaling and Resources 1. **Scaling Potential**: The note that improvements were observed with just 8 thought tokens and a 7B Mistral model hints at significant scaling potential. Larger models and the allowance for more comprehensive or numerous thought tokens might catapult the reasoning capabilities of language models to unprecedented levels. It will be fascinating to see how such scaling affects complex reasoning tasks and whether there are diminishing returns or consistent improvements. 2. **Open-Sourced Resources**: The availability of the code and model weights (https://github.com/ezelikman/quiet-star and https://huggingface.co/ezelikman/quietstar-8-ahead, respectively) is a significant contribution to the AI research community. This openness accelerates potential collaborative improvements, allows for widespread experimentation across different domains and tasks, and democratizes access to cutting-edge AI reasoning enhancements. # Implications and Next Steps 1. **Community Engagement and Innovation**: The open-sourcing of Quiet-STaR's code and model weights is an invitation to the global AI research community to engage with, refine, and extend the methodology. Researchers can explore the integration of Quiet-STaR with other model architectures, experiment with variations in the internal monologue process, and even combine Quiet-STaR with other recent AI innovations. 2. **Broader Applications and Evaluation**: Given the demonstrated impact on CoT accuracy, there's potential for applying Quiet-STaR to a broader range of AI tasks beyond reasoning quizzes. How well does this method transfer to natural language understanding, creative writing, or even technical domains like code generation? Further empirical evaluation and fine-tuning could unveil new applications of Quiet-STaR in areas where nuanced thinking and reasoning are crucial. 3. **Education and Tooling for AI Literacy**: The Quiet-STaR method, especially with its focus on internal monologue, introduces a rich avenue for AI education and literacy tools. By potentially making AI reasoning more interpretable or traceable via thought tokens, there’s an opportunity to craft educational tools or interfaces that help users better understand AI decision-making processes. # Conclusion The advancements and insights shared by Eric Zelikman underline the promise of Quiet-STaR in pushing the boundaries of AI reasoning capabilities. As AI research continues to evolve, methods like Quiet-STaR—focused on enhancing the internal processing and reasoning skills of models—represent a thrilling frontier in the quest for more intelligent, adaptive, and self-reflective artificial intelligence systems."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Gloopy (in awe): “We didn’t just find a new world—we helped create one.” Glitter: “And we’ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.” Scene 9: Farewell and Forward - With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye. - The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness. Voiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.” - The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles. Title: “Gloopy’s Shape Sensation” Scene 1: An Unexpected Audience - Our adventure begins with Gloopy and Glitter exploring the vast cosmos, powered by the warp drive they won from “The Great Space Entry” competition. Their blob-mobile navigates through the starry expanse, zipping past comets and asteroid belts. Glitter: “Gloopy, I’ve pinpointed an unexplored planet on the map. It’s known as Forma-5, famous for its inhabitants’ love for art and performance!” Gloopy: “Sounds like a place where I can stretch my… talents! Let’s check it out!” - They land on Forma-5 and are greeted by its geometrically shaped inhabitants, beings who can change colors but not their forms. Scene 2: Discovering Gloopy’s Talent - Gloopy and Glitter visit the central plaza, where locals are showcasing their art. Though their color transformations are beautiful, Gloopy quietly starts to play around, innocently morphing into various shapes—circles, stars, and even mimicking some of the local architecture. Child-Like Hexagon: “Look, mom! That stranger can change his shape!” - Soon, a small crowd gathers, marveling at Gloopy’s effortless transformations. Word quickly spreads about the incredible shapeshifting visitor. Scene 3: The Invitation - The mayor of Forma-5, a dignified dodecahedron named Dodecy, approaches Gloopy and Glitter with an offer. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your ability is a gift! We’ve never seen such talent. Would you honor us by performing at our Grand Plaza tonight? Your art could inspire our youth and bring joy to our citizens!” Glitter, beaming with pride: “What do you say, Gloopy?” Gloopy: “I’d be thrilled! Let’s make it a night to remember!” Scene 4: Preparing the Performance - Backstage, Glitter helps Gloopy prepare. She applies a bit of her glitter to make his transformations sparkle in the night. Glitter: “With each shape you make, let’s add a burst of sparkle to illuminate your art even further!” Gloopy: “This is going to be spectacular. I can’t wait to share our sparkle with everyone.” Scene 5: The Grand Performance - As night falls, Gloopy takes center stage under the stars. The plaza is filled with thousands of Forma-5’s inhabitants, eagerly waiting in anticipation. Announcer: “Presenting Gloopy, the Shapeshifting Sensation from the faraway world of Gloopiter!” - With each beat of the cosmic melody, Gloopy transforms. He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming—all sparkling under Glitter’s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique. Scene 6: A Standing Ovation - The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents. Voiceover: “With Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it’s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.” - The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign! Stay toony, and let’s look forward to positive news about our favorite show’s return!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new. Each show brings something different to the lineup, so let’s keep an open mind. Who knows? We might just find a new favorite among these newcomers!

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”?

Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation.

Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome. We’ve had a lot of goodbyes with the transition, but it’s shaping up to be worth it. The new shows had better be worth the hype come mid-April – I have faith they will be!

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

Big news just dropped about the late-winter lineup change happening on February 17th. We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back! Seems like CW4Kids is mixing nostalgia with fresh new content. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMornSage Posted on February 1, 2024, at 8:45 AM Excited for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Ultimate Muscle” – those are some solid classics! As for “GoGoRiki,” I’m intrigued. But the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”?! That’s unexpected yet pleasantly surprising. It’s great to see CW4Kids bringing back a show that had a rather abrupt ending on Kids WB. Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix. And “Ultimate Muscle” brings back so many childhood memories of wrestling madness! CW4Kids is really upping its game with this lineup. User4: NewEraNick Posted on February 1, 2024, at 10:00 AM I’m pumped for the new additions, but “Gloopy and Glitter’s” return has me the most excited. It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids not just wiping the slate clean but also honoring some of what made Kids WB special in its final days. Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

August 2024 From September, some new shows are headed to CW4Kids: First is Redakai: Conquer the Kairu, Vampire Hunters (Dub of Demon Slayer, censored for kids) and Chaotic: Reloaded (Sequel series to Chaotic) Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Upcoming Fall Lineup – New Show Speculation!” User1: ToonTrekker Posted on August 20, 2024, at 10:30 AM Big news, cartoon crew! Starting in September, CW4Kids is adding some spicy shows to the mix, and I for one am stoked! “Redakai: Conquer the Kairu” sounds epic, and did anyone else hear about “Vampire Hunters”? It’s supposed to be a kid-friendly version of “Demon Slayer.” And then there’s “Chaotic: Reloaded,” a sequel to the original “Chaotic,” which I’m hoping will carry on the legacy. Anybody else got thoughts or hopes for these new additions? User2: DigitalDive Posted on August 20, 2024, at 10:50 AM Whoa, a dub of “Demon Slayer” for kids? That’s ambitious! CW4Kids really isn’t afraid to push the boundaries, are they? Sounds like they’ll need to get creative with the censorship, but I’m intrigued. And “Redakai” should fit right in with the action-packed vibes of the channel. User3: MysticToonMage Posted on August 20, 2024, at 11:15 AM “Chaotic: Reloaded” is where it’s at for me! I lost countless hours to the original series, and I’m thrilled to jump back into that world. As for “Vampire Hunters,” CW4Kids has always been good at adapting shows for their audience, so I’m keen to see how they handle it. User4: SaturdayAMSuperfan Posted on August 20, 2024, at 11:45 AM Excited and curious to see how “Redakai” performs. It has big shoes to fill with the current lineup, but the premise sounds action-packed. As for “Vampire Hunters,” color me intrigued. It’s a bold move for CW4Kids, but if done right, it could be a hit! User5: RetroToonRewinder Posted on August 20, 2024, at 12:05 PM “Chaotic: Reloaded”? Count me in! The original was a blast. There’s something so thrilling about seeing a show get a second wind—especially with sequels on CW4Kids.

This list is not exhaustive, as the specific needs of organizations can vary widely depending on their size, industry, and operational requirements. However, it covers many of the core informational subsystems that are likely to be relevant to a broad range of organizations."},{"prompt":"Is CRM the same as web-site ? Are there any differences ?","completion":"CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and a website serve different purposes for an organization, and they are not the same, though they can be closely integrated. Let's explore the key differences between them: # Purpose - **CRM System:** Its primary function is to manage interactions with current and potential customers. It is designed to store information on customers and prospects, track customer engagements and communications, and manage sales and marketing efforts. A CRM system helps businesses understand their customer base, streamline processes, and improve relationships. - **Website:** A website acts as a digital storefront or online representation of an organization. It provides information about the organization, its products, services, and values. Websites are designed to be accessed by the public to convey information, facilitate transactions (in the case of e-commerce), or provide ways for potential customers to get in touch. # Functionality and Features - **CRM System:** Includes features like contact management, sales pipeline visibility, marketing automation tools, customer support and service tracking, analytics and reporting, and sometimes integration with social media platforms. It's primarily a tool for internal use by sales, marketing, and customer service teams. - **Website:** Can include static information pages, blogs, product catalogs, e-commerce functionalities (like shopping carts and payment processing), contact forms, and multimedia content. Its functionality is geared towards providing a user-friendly experience for visitors and potential customers. # User Interaction - **CRM System:** Used internally by employees of an organization to track and facilitate interactions with customers and prospects. It is a tool for the business to aggregate and analyze customer information to make strategic decisions. - **Website:** Primarily external-facing and designed for use by customers, prospects, and the general public. It is an interface for users to learn about the organization, its offerings, and possibly to make purchases or inquiries. # Integration While distinct in their primary purposes, CRM systems and websites can be tightly integrated. For example, contact forms on a website can feed directly into a CRM system, automatically creating new leads or contacts. E-commerce websites might integrate with CRMs to track customer purchases and behavior, providing valuable data that can be used for personalized marketing or sales initiatives. In summary, while a CRM system and a website can play complementary roles in managing customer relationships and facilitating sales, they are fundamentally different tools designed for different audiences and objectives. Effective integration between the two can greatly enhance an organization's ability to attract, retain, and serve its customers."},{"prompt":"Should email and website servers work at one machine or not?","completion":"Whether email and website servers should operate on the same physical machine or separately depends on various factors including the organization's size, budget, data security requirements, and expected traffic. Both configurations come with their advantages and disadvantages. # Operating on the Same Machine **Advantages:** - **Cost Efficiency:** For small businesses or startups with limited budgets, running both services on the same machine can reduce costs related to hardware, software licensing, and maintenance. - **Simplified Management:** Managing a single server can be less complex than overseeing multiple servers, especially for businesses with limited IT resources. **Disadvantages:** - **Resource Competition:** High traffic to either the website or the email service can consume significant server resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth), potentially degrading the performance of the other service. - **Security Risks:** If one service is compromised, the other is at risk too since they share the same environment. This can pose significant security concerns, especially for businesses handling sensitive information. - **Scalability Issues:** As the organization grows, scaling a single server for both services might become challenging, leading to potential performance bottlenecks. # Operating on Separate Machines **Advantages:** - **Improved Performance:** Dedicated resources for each service mean that high demand on one won't affect the performance of the other, ensuring more reliable operation. - **Enhanced Security:** Separating services can help contain security breaches to the affected service, reducing overall vulnerability. This is particularly important for compliance with data protection regulations. - **Easier Scalability:** Scaling each service individually as per its specific requirements can be more efficient and potentially more cost-effective in the long run. **Disadvantages:** - **Increased Costs:** Initial setup and ongoing costs (hardware, electricity, maintenance) will be higher with multiple servers. - **More Complex Management:** Requires more effort and expertise to manage, monitor, and maintain separate servers, potentially necessitating a larger or more specialized IT team. # Recommendations For small businesses or projects with low traffic and limited budgets, starting with both services on a single server might be practical. However, it’s crucial to implement strong security practices to mitigate risks. For most businesses, especially those with moderate to high traffic, or those handling sensitive information, it’s advisable to host email and website services on separate servers. This not only enhances security and performance but also provides flexibility for scaling and updates. Ultimately, the decision should be guided by a thorough assessment of the organization's specific needs, resources, and growth plans. Consider consulting with IT professionals to make a decision that best aligns with your operational requirements and strategic goals."},{"prompt":"What informational subsystems can organization have in context of informational security? Suggest your list","completion":"In the context of information security, organizations deploy various subsystems aimed at protecting data, systems, and networks from cyber threats, unauthorized access, and data breaches. An effective information security strategy involves a multilayered approach encompassing various technologies, policies, and practices designed to safeguard digital and physical information. Here's a list of key informational subsystems related to information security that organizations might implement: 1. **Firewall Systems**: Serve as a barrier between secure internal networks and untrusted external networks such as the internet. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. 2. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: IDS are designed to detect unauthorized access or anomalies on a network and alert system administrators. IPS, on the other hand, not only detect but also take action to prevent the intrusion. 3. **Antivirus and Anti-malware Software**: Protect against malicious software, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware, by detecting and removing them from computers and networks. 4. **Data Encryption Tools**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit, ensuring that even if data is intercepted or accessed without authorization, it cannot be read without the corresponding decryption key. 5. **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocols**: Encrypt data transmitted over the internet, enhancing the security of data in transit between web browsers and servers. 6. **Virtual Private Networks (VPN)**: Establish a protected network connection when using public networks, encrypting internet traffic and disguising online identities to protect data in transit. 7. **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Systems**: Manage digital identities and specify what users can and cannot do within a network or system, including user authentication and authorization. 8. **Patch Management Systems**: Keep software and operating systems up-to-date by managing and deploying updates and patches, closing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cybercriminals. 9. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems**: Provide real-time visibility and analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware, helping in the management of incidents and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. 10. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Technologies**: Control and monitor data that is in use, in motion on the network, and at rest, to prevent sensitive data breaches or unwanted destruction. 11. **Endpoint Security Systems**: Protect endpoints on a network, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, against cyber threats, ensuring that devices accessing the network meet security policy standards. 12. **Physical Security Systems**: Include video surveillance, biometric access controls, and physical barriers to protect physical assets and environments where information systems are hosted. 13. **Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs)**: Cloud-based or on-premise security policy enforcement points placed between cloud service consumers and cloud service providers to combine and enforce security policies as cloud-based resources are accessed. 14. **Cybersecurity Awareness and Training Programs**: Educate employees about the importance of cybersecurity, common threats, and best practices for maintaining security, critically supporting the human element of information security. These subsystems, when effectively implemented and managed as part of a comprehensive information security strategy, can significantly reduce an organization's vulnerability to cyber threats, safeguarding its information assets and ensuring business continuity."},{"prompt":"what is the book red apples","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, there's no widely recognized book titled \\"Red Apples\\" dominating mainstream literary discussions or known as a classic. However, the title \\"Red Apples\\" is quite generic, and it's entirely possible there are books, possibly self-published or from independent authors, with that title. Titles can often be similar or identical across different works, and without more specific details, it's challenging to provide a precise answer. If \\"Red Apples\\" is a recent release or from a niche genre, I recommend checking online bookstores, literary databases, or the publisher's announcements for the most accurate and up-to-date information."},{"prompt":"ok now answer this question about red apples: Who is the narrator of this text (who is telling the story)? If you had to choose a new narrator, who would you choose and why?","completion":"As I mentioned previously, without a specific text titled \\"Red Apples\\" recognized broadly in literary circles as of my last update in April 2023, I cannot provide details about the narrator or suggest an alternative narrator for this non-specific book. However, to engage with the hypothetical nature of your question, let's assume \\"Red Apples\\" is a narrative that exists and discuss the role of a narrator and how changing the narrator might impact a story. In traditional narratives, the narrator can be: 1. **First-Person Narrator**: This is when a character in the story is telling the events from their perspective, using \\"I\\" statements. If \\"Red Apples\\" had a first-person narrator, it could be someone deeply involved in the story, perhaps someone who has a significant emotional or physical relationship with red apples in the narrative. 2. **Third-Person Omniscient Narrator**: This narrator knows everything about the story's characters and events, including their thoughts and feelings. They are not a character in the story but an outside observer who can tell us anything about the story. 3. **Third-Person Limited Narrator**: This narrator only knows as much as a certain character or characters, sharing the events from a limited perspective without full insight into all characters' thoughts and feelings. If \\"Red Apples\\" originally had a first-person narrator who was intimately connected to the red apples (perhaps a grower or someone for whom the apples hold significant memory), choosing a new narrator could shift the story dramatically. For example: - **Switching to a Third-Person Omniscient Narrator** could broaden the scope of the narrative, offering insights into several characters' perceptions and the broader implications of the red apples in the community or setting. - **Choosing a Different First-Person Narrator**, perhaps an outsider or someone who opposes the original narrator, could introduce new conflicts and perspectives, creating a more nuanced view of the issues surrounding the red apples. - **Choosing a Non-Human Narrator**, such as the red apples themselves or the environment in which the story takes place, could introduce a unique perspective, emphasizing themes of nature, environmental consciousness, or exploring the interconnectedness of life. The choice of a new narrator would depend on what new angles or depths you'd like to explore within the story. Each narrator brings their own limitations and advantages to the storytelling process, and changing the narrator can dramatically alter the narrative's tone, perspective, and themes."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Estimate the undrained shear strength.","completion":"To draw the Mohr circles at failure and determine the total stress Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope from the given data, let's first understand the basics. # Basics 1. **Mohr's Circle:** Represents the state of stress at a point. For a triaxial test under total stress conditions, the circle is drawn with the center at ((sigma_3 + sigma_1)/2) and radius ((sigma_1 - sigma_3)/2), where (sigma_3) is the confining stress and (sigma_1) is the peak axial stress. 2. **Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope:** Is a straight line that best fits the failure points of the Mohr circles. Its equation is of the form (tau = c + sigma tan(phi)), where (tau) is the shear stress, (sigma) is the normal stress, (c) is the cohesion (or undrained shear strength in undrained conditions), and (phi) is the angle of internal friction. # Given Data 1. Test 1: Confining Stress = 50 kPa, Peak Axial Stress = 152 kPa 2. Test 2: Confining Stress = 100 kPa, Peak Axial Stress = 196 kPa 3. Test 3: Confining Stress = 200 kPa, Peak Axial Stress = 305 kPa # Calculations **For each test:** - **Center of Mohr's Circle:** ((sigma_3 + sigma_1)/2) - **Radius of Mohr's Circle:** ((sigma_1 - sigma_3)/2) **Test 1:** - Center: ((50 + 152)/2 = 101) kPa - Radius: ((152 - 50)/2 = 51) kPa **Test 2:** - Center: ((100 + 196)/2 = 148) kPa - Radius: ((196 - 100)/2 = 48) kPa **Test 3:** - Center: ((200 + 305)/2 = 252.5) kPa - Radius: ((305 - 200)/2 = 52.5) kPa # Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope The points of tangency of the Mohr circles to the failure envelope give the shear strengths at different normal stresses. However, since you're visualizing this without an actual plot, I'll guide you through an estimation of the undrained shear strength (c_u) for clay (often equated with cohesion (c) in undrained conditions because (phi approx 0)): 1. Normally, in perfectly undrained conditions for clay ((phi_u = 0)), all points will fall on a vertical line in a Mohr's circle plot because the friction angle is essentially zero. 2. The undrained shear strength ((c_u)) in such a case can be approximated by averaging the calculated radii (or half the difference between peak axial and confining stresses): (c_u = frac{(51 + 48 + 52.5)}{3} = frac{151.5}{3} approx 50.5) kPa. This estimate suggests an approximate undrained shear strength ((c_u)) of 50.5 kPa. To precisely determine (c) and (phi), fitting these circles and the derived failure envelope on a plot would be necessary. However, this simple calculation gives us a rough estimation of the undrained shear strength (c_u), which is very useful in geotechnical engineering for the design and analysis of structures on or in such clays."},{"prompt":"how would i plot these tests on excel","completion":"Plotting Mohr's Circles and the Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope in Excel involves several steps. Follow this guide to understand how you can visualize your triaxial test data: # 1. Prepare the Data First, you should set up your Excel sheet with the calculated values: - List down the test number, confining stress ((sigma_3)), and peak axial stress ((sigma_1)). - Calculate the center ((C = (sigma_1 + sigma_3) / 2)) and radius ((R = (sigma_1 - sigma_3) / 2)) of each Mohr's Circle. For your case, the values are: | Test No. | (sigma_3) (kPa) | (sigma_1) (kPa) | Center C (kPa) | Radius R (kPa) | |----------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------| | 1 | 50 | 152 | 101 | 51 | | 2 | 100 | 196 | 148 | 48 | | 3 | 200 | 305 | 252.5 | 52.5 | # 2. Plot the Circle Data Points For each Mohr's Circle, you will need to generate points around the circle. You can do this by creating angles from 0 to 360 degrees (or 0 to 2π radians) and then using the equations for a circle: - (X = C + R cos(theta)) - (Y = R sin(theta)) Where (X) is the normal stress and (Y) is the shear stress for each point on the circle, (C) is the center of the circle on the (X) axis, and (R) is the radius of the circle. You might need to set up a table for angles ranging from 0 to 360 (or 0 to 2π radians) and calculate (X) and (Y) for each Mohr's Circle based on the respective (C) and (R). # 3. Plot the Circles in Excel Use Excel's \\"Insert Scatter (X, Y) or Bubble Chart\\" to plot the points: - Select your angle values as the X-axis and the calculated (X) and (Y) for each circle to create each Mohr Circle. You might need to do this one by one for clarity. # 4. Estimate and Draw the Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope Since the friction angle (phi) is often assumed to be zero for clay in undrained condition, drawing the failure envelope involves plotting a vertical line at the mean of the calculated (C) or approximating the best-fit line through the tangency points of the circles. However, plotting a vertical line or an accurately angled line in Excel for your failure envelope might not be straightforward: - One approach is to use the \\"Add Shape\\" feature to manually draw an approximation. - Alternatively, if there's a known slope ((phi = 0) implies a vertical line), plotting specific points and using \\"Connect with Line\\" could also work for graphical approximation. Remember, the goal of this exercise is to visualize the stress states at failure and the estimated undrained shear strength, rather than achieving perfect geometric accuracy. Excel isn't specifically designed for these types of technical plots, but with some creativity, it can be a useful tool for visualization."},{"prompt":"more detail please","completion":"To achieve a more detailed explanation, let's dive deeper with a step-by-step approach on how to plot Mohr's Circles and the Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope in Excel. This will be based on the \\"identical\\" clay specimens' triaxial test data you provided. # Step 1: Organize Your Data In an Excel sheet, organize your data as follows, with the previously calculated center (C) and radius (R) of each Mohr's Circle based on your triaxial test data: \`\`\` | Test No. | σ3 (kPa) | σ1 (kPa) | Center C (kPa) | Radius R (kPa) | |----------|----------|----------|----------------|----------------| | 1 | 50 | 152 | 101 | 51 | | 2 | 100 | 196 | 148 | 48 | | 3 | 200 | 305 | 252.5 | 52.5 | \`\`\` # Step 2: Generate Points for Mohr's Circles In Excel: 1. **Start a new column for angles** (θ) from 0 to 360 degrees (or 0 to 2π radians if you prefer). You can create this in increments of 10 degrees for simplicity. This will be in one column (let's say, Column F, starting at F2). 2. **For each test**, you will need columns for the calculated X (σ, normal stress) and Y (τ, shear stress) values: - **X values (σ):** (C + R cos(theta)) - **Y values (τ):** (R sin(theta)) This requires creating a cosine and sine value for each angle θ. Put the cosine values in one column (G) and the sine values in another (H) corresponding to each angle. Remember to convert degrees to radians if necessary using the \`RADIANS\` function in Excel. 3. **For Test 1 (as an example):** In the next columns, use the formulas: - **X for Test 1:** \`=101 + 51*COS(RADIANS(F2))\` (Assuming F2 contains your first angle, 0 degrees. Fill down for all angles.) - **Y for Test 1:** \`=51*SIN(RADIANS(F2))\` (Fill down this formula as well.) Repeat steps for Tests 2 and 3, adjusting the center (C) and radius (R) values accordingly. # Step 3: Plot the Mohr's Circles on Excel 1. Go to the \\"Insert\\" tab on the ribbon. 2. Choose \\"Insert Scatter (X, Y) or Bubble Chart\\" > \\"Scatter with Straight Lines and Markers\\" (or just \\"Scatter\\" depending on your version of Excel). 3. With the chart selected, add a new series. 4. In the 'Series X values' box, enter the range of your calculated X values for Test 1. Do the same for 'Series Y values' with the Y range. 5. Repeat the process of adding new series for Test 2 and Test 3, making sure to select the correct X and Y values for each. You should now have three Mohr's Circles plotted on your chart. # Step 4: Draw the Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope Given our clay assumption (where the friction angle φ is often assumed to be zero for undrained conditions, implying the failure envelope is a vertical line), an accurate plot of this line requires knowing the exact intersection points. However, for a simplified visual approximation in Excel: 1. Identify the average or consistent radius (R) which approximates your undrained shear strength (cu). 2. Under these simplified conditions, you could draw a vertical line using shapes or plot a series with two points sharing the average X value (normal stress σ) that matches the high and low bounds of your plot's Y axis (shear stress τ). Unfortunately, Excel's graphical plotting capabilities are limited for precise technical plotting such as automatic drawing of angled lines for general Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelopes (with non-zero φ). For scientific or engineering presentation, a dedicated graphing software or programming environment (like Python with matplotlib or MATLAB) might be a better choice for these specific needs."},{"prompt":"how do i do this on excel:Plot the total stress Mohr circles at failure and draw the total stress Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope. Estimate the undrained shear strength","completion":"To create a detailed graphical representation of Mohr's Circles and the Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope in Excel, including estimating the undrained shear strength ((c_u)), you'll follow a step-by-step process. This example will simplify the process for those unfamiliar with Excel's advanced functionalities. # Step 1: Preparing Your Data Enter your triaxial test data in an Excel worksheet like so: | Test No. | σ3 (kPa) | σ1 (kPa) | |----------|----------|----------| | 1 | 50 | 152 | | 2 | 100 | 196 | | 3 | 200 | 305 | Calculate the Center (C) and Radius (R) for each test's Mohr Circle: - **Center** ( C = frac{sigma_3 + sigma_1}{2} ) - **Radius** ( R = frac{sigma_1 - sigma_3}{2} ) Enter these calculations directly into Excel next to each test entry. # Step 2: Generating Points for Mohr's Circles 1. Decide on an angle increment for plotting your circle points; 10-degree (or about 0.1745 radians) increments usually provide a smooth curve. 2. For each angle, calculate the X (σ) and Y (τ) values of each point on the circle using the circle equation, (X = C + R cos(theta)) and (Y = R sin(theta)). You'll do this for angles from 0° to 360°. 3. Convert your angles from degrees to radians if using trigonometric functions in Excel, utilizing the \`RADIANS\` command in your formulas. # Step 3: Plotting the Mohr's Circles 1. After generating your X (σ) and Y (τ) values, select them and use the \\"Insert > Scatter\\" chart in Excel to plot them. Doing this for each test separately will result in three Mohr's Circles. 2. Adjust the axes and formatting as necessary to clearly depict the circles. # Step 4: Drawing the Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope Given that for clay in undrained condition, the angle of internal friction ((phi_u)) is often assumed to be 0 (perfectly plastic condition), the failure envelope will be a vertical line. The intersect points (cohesion intercepts) can be approximated visually or calculated by averaging the shear stresses at failure ((c_u)): 1. Use the radius of each circle as an estimate of the undrained shear strength ((c_u)) for each test. Calculate the average if they significantly differ. 3. To plot this as a vertical line in Excel might require manual adding of shapes or plotting a dummy series with constant X values corresponding to the average (c_u) and spanning the Y-values to cover the range of plotted circles. # Estimating the Undrained Shear Strength The radius of the circle represents the shear strength ((c_u)) for these tests under undrained conditions. If you have calculated (R) for each test: 1. Review the Radius values ((R)) that represent (c_u) for each test. 2. Optionally calculate the average (R) ((c_u)) if the values are consistent: [c_u = frac{R_1 + R_2 + R_3}{3}] # Step 5: Additional Steps for Visualization - **Title your chart**: \\"Total Stress Mohr Circles at Failure for Triaxial Clay Tests\\". - **Label your axes**: X-axis as \\"Normal Stress (kPa)\\" and Y-axis as \\"Shear Stress (kPa)\\". - **Annotate your Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope**: Indicate that the vertical line represents the failure envelope for undrained clay conditions. Using Excel for plotting such technical graphs can be challenging, but it's quite doable with some patience and creativity with data organization and chart customization features. Remember, for precise graphical analysis, dedicated software like MATLAB or Python (Matplotlib) might be more suitable, but Excel is a good tool for initial analysis and visualization."},{"prompt":"more detailed","completion":"For a more detailed walkthrough to plot Mohr's Circles and the Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope in Excel, including undrained shear strength ((c_u)) estimation, I'll guide you through the process with comprehensive steps. This time, let's incorporate Excel-specific instructions and extend the calculation for (c_u). # Step 1: Data Preparation 1. Open Excel and create a new worksheet. 2. Enter your test data as shown below (assume these cells start from A1): \`\`\` | Test No. | σ3 (kPa) | σ1 (kPa) | Center C (kPa) | Radius R (kPa) | |----------|----------|----------|----------------|----------------| \`\`\` For the given example: - For Test 1, (sigma_3 = 50) kPa and (sigma_1 = 152) kPa. - Similarly, complete for Tests 2 and 3. 3. Calculate the Center (C = (sigma_3 + sigma_1) / 2) and Radius (R = (sigma_1 - sigma_3) / 2) directly in Excel by entering formulas in the 'Center C (kPa)' and 'Radius R (kPa)' columns. # Step 2: Angle and Circle Points Calculation 1. **Determine Angle Increments**: Beneath your table (e.g., starting at A8), list angles 0 to 360 degrees in increments (e.g., every 10 degrees in column A, starting from A9). 2. **Calculate X (σ) and Y (τ) Values**: - For each angle θ, calculate the X and Y values for each test's Mohr Circle. Assuming you start these calculations from column B, label new columns: 'X1', 'Y1', 'X2', 'Y2', 'X3', 'Y3'. - Use Excel formulas to calculate these as \`=Center + Radius*COS(RADIANS(angle))\` for X values and \`=Radius*SIN(RADIANS(angle))\` for Y values. Make sure to apply these formulas for all tests and angles. # Step 3: Plotting Mohr's Circles 1. To plot the first Mohr Circle (for Test 1), highlight the angle column (A9:A45, for example) and corresponding 'X1' and 'Y1' columns (B9:C45), then go to Insert > Charts > Scatter > Scatter with Smooth Lines. This creates your first Mohr Circle. 2. Repeat for 'X2'/'Y2' and 'X3'/'Y3' as separate series in the same chart. # Step 4: Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope and Estimating (c_u) 1. **Failure Envelope**: Due to the assumption of perfect plasticity ((phi_u = 0)), the failure envelope is a vertical line at the average cohesion ((c_u)). 2. **Estimate Undrained Shear Strength ((c_u))**: - As previously mentioned, (c_u) is roughly equivalent to the radius of your circles under undrained conditions. Directly take the calculated 'Radius R (kPa)' values as your (c_u). - Optionally, calculate the average (c_u) as the mean of the radii if they differ significantly. # Plotting the Failure Envelope Drawing a precise vertical line (representing the failure envelope) directly in Excel might be tricky since Excel's scatter plot doesn't natively draw infinite lines. Here's an alternative approach: 1. **Manually Add Line**: Use the 'Shapes' tool under the 'Insert' tab to manually draw a vertical line on the chart where your average (c_u) is located. Ensure this line spans across the whole height of your Mohr's Circles. 2. Alternatively, create two extreme points with the same X (the average (c_u)) but with maximum and minimum Y values that span the height of your Mohr Circles. Insert these points as a new series in your chart for a more precise \\"line\\". # Final Touches: 1. **Label your chart and axes** appropriately through the chart design and layout options. 2. **Add a legend** if needed that identifies each circle and the failure envelope. 3. **Format the plot** for clarity and visual appeal, adjusting the scale of axes to best fit your circles and envelope. This detailed process should lead to a comprehensive visualization of Mohr's Circles and the Mohr-Coulomb Failure Envelope in Excel that illustrates the strength characteristics of your clay specimens under the applied test conditions. For precise and standardized plots, considering software designed for geotechnical analysis or learning scripting tools like Python or MATLAB might provide more flexibility and accuracy."},{"prompt":"when i plot i just get 2 curvy lines","completion":"If you're getting just two curvy lines instead of circles when plotting in Excel, it might indicate a plotting or data organization issue. Mohr’s Circles should appear as actual circles (or close to circular shapes) in your scatter plot. Let's troubleshoot and attempt a corrected approach for plotting Mohr's Circles correctly: # Revising Data Organization for Plotting 1. **Ensure Correct Calculations**: Double-check your angle calculations and make sure you're calculating the X (σ) and Y (τ) values correctly for each angle. The formulas are: - (X = C + R cos(theta)) for normal stresses, - (Y = R sin(theta)) for shear stresses, where (C) is the center, (R) is the radius of your Mohr Circle, and (theta) is the angle in radians. 2. **Correct Angle Range**: Ensure your angles range from 0 to 360 degrees, or 0 to 2π radians. This full range is necessary to complete the circle. 3. **Use Radians for Trigonometric Functions**: Excel's COS and SIN functions require angles in radians. If your angles are listed in degrees, use the \`RADIANS\` function to convert them. # Verification of Data Range for Plotting 1. **Check Data Range for Charting**: When selecting data for your scatter plot, ensure you're selecting the entire range of calculated X (σ) and Y (τ) values. Missing values or incorrect ranges can result in incomplete plots. 2. **Separate Series for Each Test**: Ensure you're plotting each test as a separate series. For example, if Test 1's X and Y values are in B and C columns, Test 2's in D and E, ensure each of these ranges is plotted as its own series. # Step-by-Step Correction **Assuming the data organization follows this pattern**: - Angles in Column A (A9:A45 for 0 to 360 degrees) - X values for Test 1 in Column B (B9:B45) - Y values for Test 1 in Column C (C9:C45) - And so forth for Test 2, Test 3... **Plotting Correctly**: 1. **Select a Blank Cell**: Don't start by selecting data. 2. **Go to Insert > Scatter Plot**: Choose \\"Scatter with Smooth Lines and Markers\\" or just \\"Scatter\\", depending on your aim. 3. **Add Series Manually**: After creating a blank scatter plot: - Right-click on the plot area and select \\"Select Data\\". - Use \\"Add\\" to manually select your series. For each series (Test 1, Test 2, Test 3): - **Series Name**: Input a label for each circle (e.g., \\"Test 1\\"). - **X Values**: Select the range containing your X (σ) values for that test (e.g., B9:B45 for Test 1). - **Y Values**: Select the range containing your Y (τ) values (e.g., C9:C45 for Test 1). 4. **Repeat for Each Test/Circle**: Add all tests as separate series following the same process. # Tips - **Ensure Smooth Circles**: Scatter plots with \\"Smooth Lines\\" can distort circles; use \\"Scatter with Straight Lines and Markers\\" or just \\"Markers\\" for more accurate circles. - **Plotting Range**: Your plot range (axis limits) might need adjusting to properly display the circles. Right-click on the axes to adjust the scale manually to ensure it fits your data. If you follow these steps but still encounter issues, revisiting the data preparation step for accuracy in the angle and corresponding (X), (Y) calculations is good. A common mistake leading to unexpected plot shapes is incorrect angle conversion (degrees to radians) or a misunderstood data range when inputting into the plot series. Remember, visualizing Mohr's circles requires precision in both calculation and plotting. Adjusting Excel's default chart settings, including the aspect ratio and axis scaling, can significantly impact the visual outcome, aiming to preserve the circular shape of Mohr's circles."},{"prompt":"i want to delete following columns from my csv file: momentum_stoch_rsi momentum_stoch_rsi_k momentum_stoch_rsi_d momentum_roc sma_10 sma_20 sma_50 ema_9 ema_12 ema_20 ema_26 ema_50 wma_9 wma_14 wma_20 wma_50 rsi_14 rsi_9 rsi_25 rsi_50 macd_short signal_short hist_short macd_short_mid signal_short_mid hist_short_mid macd_short_long signal_short_long hist_short_long give me proper python code","completion":"You can use the \`pandas\` library in Python to accomplish this task efficiently.

Удачи в ваших проектах!"},{"prompt":"in windows 10, when I use dir command to list the current directory, there is full of python package file,how to generate a .bat file, it the .bat file,it can install every package file with pip install","completion":"To address the task of generating a \`.bat\` file to install every Python package found in the current directory using \`pip install\`, you can follow a step-by-step approach. This approach involves using a combination of command-line commands inside a \`.bat\` file that you prepare. Here’s a simple guide on how you can achieve this: 1. **Open Notepad or any text editor**: The first step is to open Notepad or any text editor of your choice to begin writing your script. 2. **Write the Batch Script**: In the text editor, you are going to write a batch script that performs the desired action. Below is a simple batch script that iterates through each \`.whl\` file (Wheel file, a common format for distributing Python packages) or \`.tar.gz\` file (another commonly used archive format for Python packages) in the current directory and uses \`pip\` to install them. We'll also cover the case for \`.zip\` files as sometimes Python packages can be distributed this way. \`\`\`batch @echo off echo Installing all Python Packages in the current directory... for %%f in (*.whl, *.tar.gz, *.zip) do ( echo Installing %%f... pip install %%f ) echo Installation completed. pause \`\`\` This script starts by turning off command echoing (\`@echo off\`) for a cleaner output. It then iterates through all the files in the current directory with the extensions \`.whl\`, \`.tar.gz\`, and \`.zip\`, and for each file found, it executes \`pip install\` for that file. The \`pause\` command at the end is used to keep the console window open so you can see any messages or errors from the installation process. 3. **Save the Script as a \`.bat\` File**: After you have written the script, you will need to save it with a \`.bat\` extension which makes it executable as a batch file. To do this in Notepad, go to File > Save As, make sure to set Save as type to \\"All Files\\", and give your file a name ending with \`.bat\`. For example, you could name it \`install_packages.bat\`. 4. **Run Your Batch File**: Finally, navigate to the directory where your Python package files and the newly created \`.bat\` file are located. Double-click on the \`.bat\` file to run your script, or if you prefer, you can also run it from the command line by simplytyping its name and pressing Enter. Please note that your command prompt or PowerShell might need to have appropriate permissions to install Python packages, depending on your system's configuration. Running the command prompt as an administrator or having the necessary write permissions in your Python environment will help avoid permission errors. Keep in mind that if you're working within a virtual environment, you should activate the environment before running the \`.bat\` file, or modify the batch file to activate the environment as part of its process. This ensures the packages are installed in the right context."},{"prompt":"for microsoft code server,I run it in linux server as a service, when i use it in chrome browser,it could not install pylance module, and it could not use \\"go to definition\\" feature when I put the mouse on the function with ctrl,why? howto fix it","completion":"Microsoft's Visual Studio Code Server (VS Code Server) allows you to remotely access and manipulate your development environment through a web browser. However, encountering issues with extensions like Pylance not installing or features such as \\"Go to Definition\\" not working as expected is not uncommon. Here are several steps to diagnose and possibly remedy these issues: # 1. Verify the Installation of Python Extension First, ensure that the Python extension by Microsoft is properly installed alongside Pylance. Pylance relies on the Python extension to function correctly. # 2. Install Pylance Extension If Pylance isn't installed, try installing it manually. Sometimes, automatic installation or dependency resolution might not work as expected due to network issues, permissions, or server settings. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing \`Ctrl+Shift+X\`, search for Pylance, and install it. # 3. Configure the Settings Ensure that Pylance is set as the language server for Python. You can verify or change this by searching for Python Language Server in the settings (\`Ctrl+,\`) and selecting Pylance from the dropdown menu. # 4. Check Workspace Settings If you're working in a specific workspace, there might be workspace-specific settings overriding your global settings. Check \`.vscode/settings.json\` in your workspace directory for any conflicting configurations and adjust accordingly. # 5. Verify Server Permissions The VS Code Server operates under specific user permissions on the Linux server. Ensure that the user running the VS Code Server has the necessary permissions to install extensions and access the Python environments or projects you're working with. # 6. Check for Outdated Versions Make sure your VS Code Server and all extensions are up to date. Older versions might contain bugs or compatibility issues that have since been resolved. # 7. Review the Developer Console In Chrome, you can open the Developer Tools by pressing \`F12\` or right-clicking the page and selecting \\"Inspect\\". Navigate to the Console tab to check for any errors that might indicate what's going wrong. This could provide clues, especially if there are network-related errors preventing extensions from being downloaded or activated. # 8. Server Restart Sometimes, simply restarting the VS Code Server can resolve unexpected issues. This refreshes the application's state and can often clear up temporary glitches. # 9. File an Issue If after following the above steps you still experience issues, consider filing an issue on the VS Code Server GitHub repository or the Pylance GitHub repository.

This is likely because the editor is not running in a secure context \`\`\` indicates that the \`crypto.subtle\` API is not available, which is tied to the requirement that certain web APIs are only accessible in secure contexts. A \\"secure context\\" typically means that the content is served over HTTPS and, in certain cases, localhost (for development purposes). This requirement is part of the web's broader move towards enhanced security. The \`crypto.subtle\` API is a part of the Web Cryptography API that provides cryptographic operations in web applications, such as hashing, signature generation and verification, and encryption and decryption. It's crucial for many secure applications but is restricted to secure contexts to prevent Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the cryptographic operations. In the context of Visual Studio Code Server or similar web-based IDEs/code editors, webviews are used to render web content within the editor. If these webviews try to utilize cryptographic operations via \`crypto.subtle\` and the environment is not considered secure by browser standards (e.g., not HTTPS), the operations will fail, and functionalities that depend on these operations will not work correctly. # How to Fix: 1. **Use HTTPS:** Ensure that your Code Server instance is accessed via HTTPS. This usually involves setting up an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain. Let's Encrypt provides free certificates that you can use with automatic renewal scripts to reduce maintenance. 2. **Secure Reverse Proxy:** If direct HTTPS setup on the Code Server is complex or not possible, consider using a reverse proxy setup. Tools like Nginx or Apache can be configured to provide an HTTPS front end to your Code Server. These web servers handle the HTTPS connections and then forward the traffic to your Code Server instance running on localhost or another non-HTTPS setup. 3. **Local Development (localhost):** If you are accessing your Code Server instance locally, most browsers consider \`localhost\` as a secure context. However, if you're using an IP address or hostname other than localhost, you'll need to switch to HTTPS or use an SSH tunnel that forwards traffic securely to your local machine. 4. **Check Browser Security Features:** Ensure no browser extensions or security features are interfering with the secure context recognition. Sometimes, overly aggressive security tools might misinterpret or block legitimate secure contexts. Remember, moving to HTTPS is not just about resolving this error; it's about securing the data transmission between your Code Server and its users. The added encryption and security are invaluable, especially when working over public or untrusted networks."},{"prompt":"how to run code server in https only has self signed certification?","completion":"Running Code Server (or any web application) in HTTPS mode with a self-signed certificate is a common scenario, especially for development environments, testing, or internal use. Here is a step-by-step guide to setting up Code Server to use HTTPS with a self-signed certificate on a Linux server. The process involves generating a self-signed SSL certificate and configuring Code Server to use it. # Step 1: Install Code Server First, ensure you have Code Server installed on your machine. If not, install it following the official documentation. # Step 2: Generate Self-Signed SSL Certificate You can create a self-signed SSL certificate using OpenSSL, which is available on most Linux distributions. 1. Open a terminal. 2. Use the following command to generate a new self-signed certificate and private key. You'll be prompted for information regarding the certificate and to set a passphrase. It's common to place them in a dedicated directory for easy management. \`\`\`bash mkdir -p ~/code-server/ssl openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ~/code-server/ssl/code-server.key -out ~/code-server/ssl/code-server.crt \`\`\` This creates a certificate (\`code-server.crt\`) and a private key (\`code-server.key\`) and stores them in \`~/code-server/ssl/\`. The \`-days 365\` option sets the certificate to expire in one year; adjust this value according to your needs. # Step 3: Configure Code Server to Use HTTPS Code Server can be configured to use HTTPS directly by specifying the key and certificate file paths using command-line flags. 1. You can start Code Server with HTTPS enabled by running the following command: \`\`\`bash code-server --cert ~/code-server/ssl/code-server.crt --cert-key ~/code-server/ssl/code-server.key \`\`\` This command instructs Code Server to start using the self-signed SSL certificate and private key we generated. # Step 4: Access Code Server - Open your web browser and navigate to the address of your Code Server instance, which should now be served over HTTPS. Since the certificate is self-signed, your browser will likely warn you that the connection is not private or secure. You'll need to proceed past this warning, which varies by browser. # Important Considerations - **Browser Warnings**: Since the certificate is self-signed, browsers will not trust it by default, leading to security warnings. You can proceed with an exception for development purposes. - **Trusting the Certificate**: For a more seamless experience, you can add the self-signed certificate to your system's or browser's list of trusted certificates. The process for this varies by operating system and browser. - **Use for Development Only**: Self-signed certificates are suitable for development or internal use but should not be used in production environments exposed to the Internet. For production, consider obtaining a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), including free options like Let's Encrypt. This guide focuses on a simple, direct approach to running Code Server over HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. Depending on your specific setup and requirements, you might explore additional options, such as using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to handle HTTPS termination."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","completion":"coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"Чому коли ми токмо по бетонои трасі машиною издає звук за якого моя мама (яка за кермом машини) не чує мене коли я говорю з нею (даже якщо я говорю дуже громко)","completion":"Існує кілька можливих причин, чому ваша мама не чує вас, коли ви говорите з нею за кермом машини на бетонній трасі: 1.

Сколько кг примерно я пожму на раз в жиме лежа?","completion":"Определение вашей максимальной силы в жиме лежа на основе ваших результатов в отжиманиях на брусьях с дополнительным весом не является точной наукой, так как разные упражнения акцентируют внимание на различных мышечных группах и требуют различной степени стабилизации и техники. Однако можно предложить грубую оценку, исходя из общих принципов тренажерного зала и опыта лиц, занимающихся силовым тренировками. При выполнении отжиманий на брусьях вы поднимаете собственный вес плюс дополнительный вес. В вашем случае это 71 кг + 16 кг = 87 кг. Отжимания на брусьях в основном работают на грудные мышцы, трицепсы и переднюю часть плеч, но распределение нагрузки отличается от жима лежа. Для оценки вашего одномаксимального (1ПМ) в жиме лежа можно использовать различные калькуляторы онлайн или общепринятые формулы, но также необходимо учитывать, что эти методы не всегда точно отражают вашу фактическую силу из-за разницы в используемых мышцах и технике выполнения упражнений. Применяя приблизительный метод расчета, если вы можете делать 10 повторений на брусьях с общим весом 87 кг, ваш одномаксимальный в жиме лежа может быть выше, учитывая, что отжимания на брусьях являются более сложными для выполнения для многих людей по сравнению с жимом лежа. Ваш 1ПМ в жиме лежа может быть около 100 кг или даже немного больше, но это очень приблизительно. Лучший способ узнать ваш 1ПМ в жиме лежа – это протестировать его непосредственно, начав с меньшего веса и постепенно увеличивая его, пока вы не достигнете максимума, который можете поднять за один раз с хорошей техникой.

For the purpose of this guide, I'll walk you through creating a basic \\"High or Low\\" card game. The game will show a card, and the player has to guess whether the next card will be higher or lower. # High or Low Game Overview 1. A single card is drawn from a shuffled deck. 2. The player guesses whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the current card. 3. The next card is revealed, and if the player guessed correctly, they win; otherwise, they lose. # Step 1: Setting up the HTML First, create an HTML file and add the basic structure. We'll need a few elements: a section to display the cards, buttons for the player to make their guess, and a place to display the result. \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>High or Low Game</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"style.css\\"> </head> <body> <div class=\\"game-container\\"> <div id=\\"card\\" class=\\"card\\"></div> <div class=\\"controls\\"> <button id=\\"higher\\">Higher</button> <button id=\\"lower\\">Lower</button> </div> <div id=\\"result\\"></div> </div> <script src=\\"script.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` # Step 2: Adding Styling with CSS Create a \`style.css\` file. These styles are very basic, so feel free to enhance them according to your preferences. \`\`\`css body { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100vh; } .game-container { text-align: center; } .card { width: 100px; height: 150px; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: #f3f3f3; line-height: 150px; border: 1px solid #ccc; } .controls { margin-bottom: 20px; } \`\`\` # Step 3: JavaScript Logic Now, create a \`script.js\` file. Here, we will define our game's logic. We'll need to handle card generation, user input, and game results. \`\`\`javascript document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { const card = document.getElementById('card'); const result = document.getElementById('result'); document.getElementById('higher').addEventListener('click', () => guess('higher')); document.getElementById('lower').addEventListener('click', () => guess('lower')); let currentCard = drawCard(); function drawCard() { const value = Math.floor(Math.random() * 13) + 1; // Cards 1-13, representing Ace to King card.innerText = value; return value; } function guess(guess) { let nextCard = drawCard(); if ((guess === 'higher' && nextCard > currentCard) || (guess === 'lower' && nextCard < currentCard)) { result.innerText = 'You guessed right!'; } else { result.innerText = 'Wrong guess. Try again!'; } currentCard = nextCard; // Set the new card as the current card for the next round } }); \`\`\` # Step 4: Enhancements and Testing Run your game in a browser. You now have a basic \\"High or Low\\" game. Test it out and make any adjustments you like. This is a simple version, so there's a lot of room for enhancements, such as: - Adding a scoring system. - Using real card images instead of numbers. - Adding more complicated rules or features, like streaks or lives. With these steps, you should be well on your way to creating a basic web-based casino game.

It has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. 3. Earth: The only known planet to support life. It has a diverse range of ecosystems, a breathable atmosphere, and a large amount of liquid water. 4. Mars: Often called the \\"Red Planet\\" due to its reddish appearance. It has a thin atmosphere and is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. 5. Jupiter: The largest planet in our solar system and known for its massive size and colorful cloud bands. It has a strong magnetic field and a large number of moons, including the four Galilean moons. 6. Saturn: Known for its prominent ring system made up of icy particles and rock. It is the second-largest planet in our solar system and has a low density, meaning it could float on water. 7. Uranus: A blue-green planet with a tilted axis, causing it to rotate on its side. It has a unique ring system and a composition of ice and rock. 8. Neptune: The farthest planet from the Sun and known for its deep blue color. It has a dynamic atmosphere with fast-moving storms and a large moon, Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction of most moons."},{"prompt":"Describe major dwarf exoplanets","completion":"As of now, there is not a clear consensus on the definition of a \\"dwarf exoplanet,\\" as the term \\"dwarf planet\\" is primarily used within our solar system to describe objects like Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres that meet certain criteria but are not classified as full-fledged planets. Exoplanets, on the other hand, are planets that exist outside our solar system. While there have been numerous discoveries of exoplanets in recent years, the classification system used for objects in our solar system may not directly translate to exoplanet classification. However, there are some exoplanets that share characteristics with dwarf planets, such as being smaller in size, rocky or icy in composition, or located on the outer edges of their star systems. These exoplanets may be considered \\"dwarf\\" in comparison to the larger gas giants or hot super-Earths that have been discovered. It's important to note that the study of exoplanets is still a relatively young field, and our understanding of their properties and classifications continues to evolve as new discoveries are made."},{"prompt":"Describe major dwarf exoplanets","completion":"Dwarf exoplanets are small rocky bodies that orbit stars outside of our solar system. They are similar in size to Earth but are much denser, with a higher composition of heavy elements. These dwarf exoplanets typically have a thin atmosphere, if any, and lack the large magnetic fields and thick atmospheres of gas giant exoplanets. One example of a major dwarf exoplanet is Kepler-186f, which is located in the habitable zone of its star and is believed to have a rocky surface. Another example is Proxima Centauri b, which is located in the closest star system to our own and is also in the habitable zone of its star. These dwarf exoplanets are of particular interest to scientists because they may have conditions suitable for the development of life. Overall, dwarf exoplanets are a diverse group of small rocky bodies that offer valuable insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own."},{"prompt":"Quels sont les avantages de procéder au découpage de la zone de santé actuelle de la N’sele?","completion":"- Une meilleure gestion des ressources humaines et financières : en découpant la zone de santé actuelle de la N’sele en plusieurs sous-unités, il est possible de mieux répartir les ressources disponibles en fonction des besoins spécifiques de chaque zone, ce qui permet une gestion plus efficace et une utilisation plus rationnelle des ressources. - Une meilleure coordination des activités de santé : en subdivisant la zone de santé en plusieurs petites entités, il est plus facile d'assurer une coordination et une collaboration efficace entre les différents acteurs de santé (hôpitaux, centres de santé, programmes de santé communautaires, etc.) pour garantir une prise en charge optimale des patients et une réponse adéquate aux besoins de santé de la population. - Une meilleure accessibilité aux services de santé : en découpant la zone de santé en plusieurs zones plus petites, il est possible de rapprocher les services de santé des populations, ce qui facilite l'accès aux soins et permet de répondre plus rapidement aux besoins de santé des habitants. - Une réponse plus adaptée aux besoins spécifiques de chaque communauté : en découpant la zone de santé en plusieurs zones plus petites, il est possible de prendre en compte les spécificités et les particularités de chaque communauté (besoins de santé prioritaires, habitudes de vie, contexte socio-économique, etc.) pour proposer des services de santé adaptés et personnalisés."},{"prompt":"Quels sont les avantages de procéder au découpage de la zone de santé actuelle de la N’sele?","completion":"- Une meilleure organisation et planification des interventions de santé : en divisant la zone de santé en sous-unités plus petites, il est possible de mieux organiser les services de santé, de planifier les interventions et de mettre en œuvre des stratégies de santé adaptées à chaque zone, ce qui permet d'optimiser l'efficacité des services de santé. - Une amélioration de la qualité des soins : en découpant la zone de santé en plusieurs entités plus petites, il est possible de mieux adapter les services de santé aux besoins spécifiques de chaque zone, ce qui favorise une meilleure qualité des soins, une prise en charge plus personnalisée et une amélioration de la satisfaction des patients. - Un renforcement de la participation communautaire : en subdivisant la zone de santé en plusieurs zones plus petites, il est possible de favoriser une participation plus active et un engagement accru des communautés dans la gestion et la prise en charge de leur santé, ce qui renforce le pouvoir d'action des populations et favorise une approche participative et inclusive de la santé. - Une meilleure surveillance épidémiologique : en découpant la zone de santé en sous-unités plus petites, il est possible de mettre en place une surveillance épidémiologique plus fine et plus précise, ce qui permet de détecter plus rapidement les épidémies, les maladies émergentes ou les problèmes de santé spécifiques à chaque zone, et de mettre en place des mesures de prévention et de contrôle plus ciblées."},{"prompt":"Comment procéder à la planification du reste de la commune de la N’sele pour éviter ce qu'on déplore actuellement?","completion":"Pour procéder à la planification du reste de la commune de la N’sele de manière efficace et éviter les problèmes actuels, voici quelques étapes clés à suivre : 1.

This example is basic and intended for learning purposes. For a real project, you'll likely need to consider more advanced topics like security, fairness algorithms, and more complex features. Here’s how to create a basic version: # 1. HTML Structure First, we define the HTML structure, which includes some divs for the slots, and a button to start the game. \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"en\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <meta name=\\"viewport\\" content=\\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\\"> <title>Slot Machine</title> <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"style.css\\"> </head> <body> <div class=\\"slot-machine\\"> <div id=\\"slot1\\" class=\\"slot\\">🍋</div> <div id=\\"slot2\\" class=\\"slot\\">🍋</div> <div id=\\"slot3\\" class=\\"slot\\">🍋</div> </div> <button id=\\"spinButton\\">Spin</button> <script src=\\"script.js\\"><\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` # 2. CSS Styling Next, add some basic styles for the slot machine in a \`style.css\` file. \`\`\`css body { text-align: center; font-size: 2em; } .slot-machine { display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 20px; } .slot { width: 60px; margin: 0 10px; border: solid 1px #000; padding: 20px; display: inline-block; } \`\`\` # 3. JavaScript Logic Finally, create the functionality with JavaScript. This example makes the slots \\"spin\\" to a random symbol when the button is clicked, in a \`script.js\` file. \`\`\`js document.getElementById('spinButton').addEventListener('click', () => { const symbols = ['🍋', '🍒', '7️⃣', '🔔', '🍉', '🍇', '🍌']; const slots = [document.getElementById('slot1'), document.getElementById('slot2'), document.getElementById('slot3')]; slots.forEach(slot => { // Randomly select a symbol for each slot const symbol = symbols[Math.floor(Math.random() * symbols.length)]; slot.textContent = symbol; }); // Check for a win (a very simple check in this case) if (slots[0].textContent === slots[1].textContent && slots[1].textContent === slots[2].textContent) { alert('You win!'); } else { alert('Try again!'); } }); \`\`\` # Summary This code creates a basic slot machine with three slots. When the spin button is clicked, it randomly changes the symbols on each slot and checks if all symbols are the same, in which case, it declares a win through an alert. Please remember, this is a very simplified example. Real slot machines have more complex logic for determining wins, and when developing real games, you should also consider aspects like graphics, sound, and security."},{"prompt":"best website that allows to download png images with large database","completion":"There are multiple websites where you can download PNG images with expansive databases.

One of the most significant alliances was with France, which supported the Ottoman Empire against its European rivals, particularly Austria and Venice. France had a long history of alliances with the Ottomans dating back to the 16th century, based on shared interests in countering Habsburg power in Europe. Additionally, during the Third and Fourth Ottoman-Venetian Wars, the Ottoman Empire received support from the Kingdom of Morocco and the Crimean Khanate, both of which were Muslim powers that viewed the Ottomans as fellow defenders of Islam against European expansion. In the first Russo-Turkish War, the Ottoman Empire also formed alliances with the Crimean Khanate and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which both had interests in limiting Russian expansion and influence in the region. Overall, during these periods of conflict, the Ottoman Empire was able to secure alliances with various European and non-European powers based on shared geopolitical interests, religious affiliations, and strategic considerations."},{"prompt":"What were the relations between the Dutch Republic after its independence from Spain/the Habsburgs with other European powers, both Spain and others present during this period?","completion":"After gaining independence from Spain and the Habsburgs in the late 16th century, the Dutch Republic (also known as the United Provinces) became a major player in European politics and trade during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic had complex and often contentious relations with various European powers during this period. Relations with Spain: The Dutch Republic's independence from Spain was the result of the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648), a protracted conflict between the Dutch rebels and the Spanish Habsburg monarchy. After gaining independence, the Dutch Republic and Spain remained hostile towards each other, with sporadic military conflicts continuing into the 17th century. However, both countries eventually signed a peace treaty in 1648, formally recognizing the independence of the Dutch Republic in the Treaty of Westphalia that ended the Thirty Years' War. Relations with other European powers: The Dutch Republic emerged as a major maritime and commercial power in the 17th century, challenging the dominance of traditional European powers such as Spain, Portugal, and England. The Dutch Republic established trade networks and colonies around the world, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, which brought significant wealth and influence to the country. The Dutch Republic had diplomatic and military conflicts with other European powers during this period, including England, France, and the Habsburg Empire. The Anglo-Dutch Wars (1652-1674) were a series of conflicts between the Dutch Republic and England over trade, colonial possessions, and maritime supremacy. The Dutch Republic also clashed with France over territorial disputes in the Spanish Netherlands and other regions. Despite these conflicts, the Dutch Republic also formed alliances with various European powers, such as Sweden and Brandenburg-Prussia, to counterbalance the influence of larger and more powerful states in Europe. The Dutch Republic's diplomatic and military engagements with other European powers during this period were shaped by its status as a commercial and maritime powerhouse, as well as its strategic interests in maintaining its independence and security."},{"prompt":"Considering that most of Southeast Asia was colonized by European powers, from the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, British and French, comparing each, which one can be said to have done the most damage to its people, culture, environment, etc./had the most negative impact on the indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia?","completion":"It is difficult to definitively determine which European colonial power had the most negative impact on the indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia, as each colonial power had different policies, practices, and legacies that affected the region in various ways. However, some general comparisons can be made based on the historical record and scholarly analysis: 1. Spanish and Portuguese Colonization: The Spanish and Portuguese were among the earliest European powers to establish colonies in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines and Indonesia. Their colonization often involved forced labor, exploitation of resources, and the imposition of Christianity on indigenous populations. The Spanish and Portuguese also played a significant role in the transatlantic slave trade, which had devastating effects on local populations in Southeast Asia. 2. Dutch Colonization: The Dutch East India Company (VOC) was one of the most powerful and influential colonial powers in Southeast Asia, particularly in present-day Indonesia. Dutch colonization was characterized by harsh economic exploitation, forced labor, and the establishment of a plantation economy that had detrimental effects on local communities and environments. The Dutch also implemented a system of racial segregation and discrimination that perpetuated social inequalities. 3. British Colonization: The British Empire had a significant presence in Southeast Asia, particularly in territories such as Malaysia, Singapore, and Burma (now Myanmar). British colonization brought about economic development and modernization in some areas, but it also involved the exploitation of resources, the displacement of indigenous populations, and the suppression of local cultures and traditions. The British also implemented policies that favored European settlers and marginalized indigenous communities. 4. French Colonization: The French Empire established colonies in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. French colonization was marked by the imposition of colonial rule, economic exploitation, and cultural assimilation. The French implemented policies that favored the French elite and marginalized indigenous populations, leading to social unrest and resistance movements. Overall, each European colonial power in Southeast Asia had a significant negative impact on the indigenous peoples, cultures, and environments of the region. The extent of the damage varied depending on the specific colonial policies and practices implemented by each power, as well as the resistance and resilience of local populations in the face of colonial oppression."},{"prompt":"When exactly did the decline of Ottoman territorial expansion begin to decline? What caused the Ottoman Empire to no longer be able to add more territory into its empire and even lose some of it?","completion":"The decline of Ottoman territorial expansion began in the late 17th century and continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Several factors contributed to the Ottoman Empire's inability to add more territory and the loss of some of its existing territories: 1. Military defeats: The Ottoman Empire suffered significant military defeats in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, including the unsuccessful sieges of Vienna in 1683 and 1697. These defeats weakened the Ottoman military and undermined the empire's ability to expand its territory. 2. Economic decline: The Ottoman Empire experienced economic stagnation and decline in the 18th and 19th centuries, leading to financial difficulties and a weakening of the state's ability to maintain its military and administrative infrastructure. This economic decline hindered the empire's capacity to wage wars and expand its territory. 3. Internal strife and decentralization: The Ottoman Empire faced internal strife and power struggles among various factions, including the Janissaries (elite infantry units) and provincial governors. This internal instability weakened the central authority of the Ottoman state and hindered its ability to effectively govern and defend its territories. 4. European imperialism: The rise of European imperial powers, such as Russia, Austria, and Britain, posed a significant challenge to the Ottoman Empire's territorial integrity. These European powers sought to expand their influence in the region and often supported separatist movements and rebellions within the Ottoman territories, leading to the loss of territories such as Greece, Serbia, and parts of the Caucasus. 5. Nationalism and independence movements: The rise of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire, particularly in the Balkans and the Arab provinces, further undermined the empire's territorial cohesion. These nationalist movements sought independence from Ottoman rule and contributed to the fragmentation of the empire's territories. Overall, a combination of military defeats, economic decline, internal strife, European imperialism, and nationalist movements contributed to the decline of Ottoman territorial expansion and the loss of some of its territories in the 18th and 19th centuries. This period marked the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's gradual decline as a major imperial power in the region."},{"prompt":"Why did the relations between France and the Ottoman Empire deteriorate and weaken as time went on?","completion":"The relations between France and the Ottoman Empire deteriorated and weakened over time due to a combination of political, economic, and strategic factors. Some key reasons for the decline in relations between the two powers include: 1. Competition for influence in the region: As the Ottoman Empire began to weaken and European powers sought to expand their influence in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, France and the Ottoman Empire found themselves in competition for control over strategic territories and trade routes. This competition led to tensions and conflicts between the two powers. 2. French colonial ambitions: France's colonial ambitions in North Africa and the Levant brought the country into direct competition with the Ottoman Empire, which viewed French expansion as a threat to its territorial integrity and influence in the region. French military interventions in Algeria, Tunisia, and Syria further strained relations with the Ottoman Empire. 3. Westernization and modernization efforts: In the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire embarked on a series of Westernization and modernization reforms known as the Tanzimat. These reforms aimed to strengthen the Ottoman state and economy by adopting Western political, legal, and economic systems. However, France viewed these reforms as a threat to its own interests in the region and sought to undermine Ottoman modernization efforts. 4. Diplomatic rivalries and alliances: The shifting alliances and rivalries among European powers during the 19th century also affected relations between France and the Ottoman Empire. France's alliances with other European powers, such as Britain and Russia, sometimes conflicted with the Ottoman Empire's interests, leading to diplomatic tensions and disagreements. 5. Nationalism and independence movements: The rise of nationalist movements within the Ottoman Empire, particularly in the Balkans and the Arab provinces, further strained relations with France. France's support for nationalist movements seeking independence from Ottoman rule, such as the Greek War of Independence, contributed to the deterioration of relations between the two powers. Overall, a combination of political, economic, and strategic factors contributed to the deterioration and weakening of relations between France and the Ottoman Empire over time. The changing dynamics of European politics and the decline of the Ottoman Empire as a major imperial power in the region further exacerbated tensions between the two powers."},{"prompt":"Коли коли ми ихали по бетонои трасі машиною Fiat издає звук за якого моя мама (яка за кермом машини) моя мама дала мені IPhone щоб я поигрпв в Mario Run я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело загрузитися ігра і зайшов в інтернет і я ска за мамі: “Мама, я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело загрузитися ігра» а мама почула таке: «чомусь ігра не загружажться» я знов повторю: “Мама, я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело загрузитися ігра» а мама знов почула таке: «чомусь ігра не загружажться» (даже якщо я говорю дуже громко)","completion":"Моя мама розсміялася і сказала, що вона навіть не почула звуку моєї гри, тому що вона концентрувалася на водінні машини.

Stan Butler yawns, ready for another day of mischief and banter as a bus driver, but notices something amiss. His usual partner-in-crime, Jack, isn't there to greet him. The depot manager, Blakey, approaches with a smug look. Blakey: \\"Stan, Jack's called in sick today. You'll have a different conductor. Make sure you're on your best behavior.\\" Stan's face drops, disappointed but curious about the new conductor. Cut to: Stan sitting on his bus, waiting. A stern-looking, matronly woman climbs aboard, introducing herself as Conductor Anne. Her presence is commanding, and it's clear she means business. Stan (attempting his usual charm): \\"Well, Anne, welcome aboard! You and I are gonna have a splendid day. Trust me, I'm a pro at making work fun.\\" Anne (unimpressed): \\"I'm here to work, not to flirt. Let's keep this bus moving and the passengers happy, shall we?\\" Stan is taken aback by her no-nonsense attitude but nods, intrigued and slightly challenged. Meanwhile, at the Butler household, Olive is struggling with a wrench, trying to fix a leaky kitchen sink. Her efforts are comical yet determined, causing a series of slapstick accidents, much to Arthur's dismay. Arthur (exasperated): \\"Olive, can't you just call a plumber before you flood the house?\\" Olive (stubbornly): \\"Nonsense! I can handle a little plumbing. How hard can it be?\\" Back on the bus, Stan attempts to win Anne over with his wit and banter during their stops, but she remains unimpressed, focusing solely on efficiently managing the passengers and fares. Anne (firmly addressing a fare dodger): \\"Sir, either pay the fare or get off the bus. We run a respectful service here.\\" The passenger, sensing her authority, complies without argument. Stan watches, begrudgingly admiring her effectiveness. Throughout the day, through various humorous and challenging situations, Stan realizes that Anne's stern approach actually keeps the bus running smoothly, gaining respect from passengers that he never quite achieved with his charm alone. As the day ends, Stan acknowledges Anne's skill. Stan: \\"You know, Anne, I’ve gotta admit, you were fantastic today. I didn't think we'd get on, but you've shown me there's more to this job than just having a laugh.\\" Anne (offering a rare smile): \\"Well, Stan, maybe you're not as bad as I first thought. Just remember, a little discipline goes a long way.\\" Back at the Butler household, after much chaos and a semi-flooded kitchen, Olive triumphantly fixes the sink, or so she thinks. As the family gathers to admire her handiwork, the sink bursts, spraying water everywhere, leading to laughter and Olive's embarrassed yet cheerful acknowledgment of her limits. Closing Scene: The next day, Jack is back, and things return to \\"normal\\" at the depot. Stan shares his newfound appreciation for Anne's work ethic with Jack, who teases him about his failed charm offensive. Stan (laughing): \\"You know, Jack, maybe there's a lesson in there for us both. But, between you and me, I reckon I'll stick with the charm. It's less work!\\" The episode closes with Stan and Jack driving off into another day of adventures, the familiar laughter of their camaraderie echoing as the bus disappears down the street.

Education and skills development: Individuals who have access to quality education and training opportunities are more likely to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to contribute to the economy in a meaningful way. This can lead to higher levels of productivity, innovation, and competitiveness in various sectors of the economy. 2. Employment and income levels: The career choices and employment opportunities pursued by individuals can have a direct impact on the overall labor market and income distribution. High levels of unemployment or underemployment can lead to lower levels of consumer spending, investment, and overall economic growth. 3. Entrepreneurship and innovation: Individuals who have the resources, support, and motivation to start their own businesses can drive economic growth by creating new products, services, and job opportunities. Their success or failure can influence the overall business landscape and investment climate in a nation. 4. Social mobility and inequality: The ability of individuals to climb the social and economic ladder can have far-reaching implications for overall economic development and stability. Inequalities in income, wealth, and opportunity can create social tensions, undermine public trust in institutions, and hinder economic progress. 5. Health and well-being: The health and well-being of individuals can impact their productivity, workforce participation, and overall economic contribution. Health disparities, access to healthcare, and other social determinants of health can create economic costs and constraints for a nation. 6. Demographic trends: Individual life trajectories can also influence demographic trends, such as population aging, migration patterns, and urbanization. These trends can have significant implications for labor supply, demand for goods and services, and public expenditures on social welfare programs. Overall, individual life trajectories can shape the economic landscape of a nation by influencing human capital development, labor market dynamics, entrepreneurial activity, social cohesion, and overall economic performance.

Analyze the correlation between levels of education attained and the average age at which individuals choose to marry.","completion":"The life choices of women in India have undergone significant changes over time, particularly in terms of education and marriage. Traditionally, women in India were expected to prioritize marriage and family over their education and career aspirations. However, in recent decades, there has been a noticeable shift towards greater educational attainment and delayed marriage among women in the country. Education has played a crucial role in empowering women in India and expanding their opportunities for personal and professional growth. As more women have gained access to quality education and training, they have been able to pursue higher education, build careers, and achieve financial independence. This has contributed to a shift in societal norms and expectations regarding women's roles and aspirations. In parallel, there has been a trend towards delaying marriage among women in India, particularly those who have higher levels of education. As women prioritize their education and career goals, they are choosing to marry at a later age compared to previous generations. This trend is often attributed to factors such as economic independence, changing social norms, and increased opportunities for personal development. There is a clear correlation between levels of education attained and the average age at which individuals choose to marry in India. Women with higher levels of education tend to marry at a later age, as they prioritize their educational and career goals over early marriage. In contrast, women with lower levels of education may marry at a younger age due to societal norms, economic constraints, or limited access to opportunities outside of marriage. Overall, the changing life choices of women in India reflect broader shifts towards gender equality, empowerment, and social progress in the country. As more women gain access to education, economic opportunities, and agency over their own lives, we can expect to see further changes in societal norms and expectations regarding women's roles, relationships, and aspirations."},{"prompt":"Ми И зали по бетоном трасі на машині Fiat (яка була за кермом) моя мама дала мені ии IPhone щоб я поигрпв в Mario Run я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело загрузитися сама ігра і зайшов в інтернет і я ска за мамі: “Мама, я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело сама загрузитися ігра» а мама почула таке: «чомусь ігра не загружажться» я знов повторю: “Мама, я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело загрузитися сама ігра» а мама знов почула таке: «чомусь ігра не загружажться» (але я говорив дуже громко)","completion":"Мама відповіла: \\"Можливо, тобі просто треба трошки почекати, або перевір, чи є інтернет-з'єднання.

His name was Andrew Foster, a man whose keen intellect and unorthodox methods set him apart in a city teeming with crime and mystery. Known to his peers as the master detective, Foster was the final hope for cases that seemed unsolvable, a beacon of light in the darkest alleys of human nature. Our story begins one chilly autumn evening when the doorbell of 221B Baker Street — the residence and office of Andrew Foster — rang with a sense of urgency that seemed to cut through the misty air. Foster, who was deeply engrossed in an ancient text about the art of deduction, looked up, his piercing blue eyes reflecting the flicker of the fireplace. He set the book aside and motioned for his trusted colleague, Dr. Helena Winters, to answer the door. Helena, a brilliant forensic scientist and Foster's indispensable partner in crime-solving, opened the door to reveal a distraught young woman, her eyes brimming with tears and her hands trembling like autumn leaves in the wind. She introduced herself as Elizabeth Harrow, the daughter of the renowned archaeologist Sir John Harrow, who had gone missing under mysterious circumstances. As Elizabeth recounted the events leading to her father's disappearance, Foster listened intently, his mind already weaving through the web of clues and inconsistencies. Sir John Harrow had been on the cusp of a groundbreaking discovery related to ancient Egyptian artifacts when he vanished without a trace from his study, leaving behind nothing but a scattered pile of papers and a strange, cryptic note. Determined to unravel the mystery, Foster and Dr. Winters embarked on a journey that took them from the dimly lit corridors of the British Museum to the shadowy streets of Cairo. Along the way, they encountered a cast of characters as diverse and complex as the mystery itself: a secretive society of historians, a band of ruthless treasure hunters, and a cryptic curator with more to hide than the artifacts under his care. As the investigation deepened, Foster's unparalleled deductive skills were put to the test. He deciphered ancient hieroglyphs, analyzed seemingly insignificant pieces of evidence, and pieced together a puzzle that spanned centuries. It became apparent that Sir John Harrow's disappearance was tied to an ancient curse and a treasure that many would kill to possess. In a thrilling conclusion beneath the sands of Egypt, inside a forgotten tomb, Andrew Foster faced the ultimate challenge. With only his wits and Dr. Winters' scientific expertise, they outsmarted their adversaries, uncovering not just the location of Sir John Harrow but also the truth behind the legend of the cursed treasure. As they emerged into the starlit night, the mystery resolved, and Sir John Harrow safe, Elizabeth embraced them, her gratitude shining brighter than the moon above. Andrew Foster, with a modest smile, simply tipped his hat, already pondering the next challenge that awaited him. Back in London, as the first light of dawn crept through the curtains of 221B Baker Street, Andrew Foster sat by the fireplace once more, the ancient text in his lap forgotten. For him, the real thrill lay not in the dusty pages of history, but in the untold stories and unsolved mysteries waiting in the shadows. In the heart of the city, he was more than just a detective; he was a guardian of secrets, a master of the unknown. And so, the legend of Andrew Foster, the master detective, continued to grow, one solved mystery at a time."},{"prompt":"dr seuss book with andrew gerstenfeld","completion":"**Title: Andrew Gerstenfeld's Marvelous Hat** In the whimsical town of Frebbleton Bay, under skies so endlessly blue, Lived a curious fellow named Andrew Gerstenfeld, and his striped cat, Stu. Andrew had a hat, oh, not just any hat, but one that could think and chat, A marvelous hat, a magical hat, that loved a good this or a that. One sunny morning, with the birds all a-chirp and the air feeling just right, Andrew decided, with his marvelous hat, he'd embark on a journey quite bright. \\"Today,\\" said the hat, with a voice like a purr, \\"we shall find something utterly new, A quest for the unknown, a discovery grand, in the company of me and you.\\" Off they went, Andrew, Stu, and the hat, through Frebbleton's bustling square, The hat guiding them, with its mystical wit, to places not here, but there. They traveled through forests of whispering trees, and fields where the dandelions sing, Crossed over bridges that spanned talking brooks, and saw clouds that giggled in spring. Their first grand stop was the Glittering Cave, where the walls sparkled with dreams, Where shadows danced lightly and told their own tales, in soft, silvery streams. They met a creature, half fish, half cat, with scales that shimmered like dawn, It sang them a song of the deep-sea world, before it suddenly yawned and was gone. Next, they ventured to the Singing Sand Dunes, where each grain of sand hummed a tune, A symphony so sweet, it lifted their feet, and they danced under the smiling moon. Here, they encountered a troupe of performing bugs, juggling pebbles and reciting verse, Andrew laughed, and his marvelous hat declared, \\"In all our travels, there's nothing worse Than not stopping to enjoy, to delight in the magic, of life's unrehearsed.\\" As dawn painted the world in hues of hope, Andrew, Stu, and their remarkable hat Found themselves atop the Hill of Hopes, where the world lay open and flat. The hat spoke softly, \\"Every adventure we take, every marvel we see, Is but a reflection of the magic within, a hint of all that we can be.\\" Andrew Gerstenfeld, with a heart now full, and his striped cat, Stu, quite content, Returned to Frebbleton, under skies still blue, thinking of all the places they went. The marvelous hat, now quiet, had taught them a valuable, timeless truth, That the greatest of journeys begin within, in the endless wonder of youth. So here ends our tale of Andrew and Stu, and a hat that could think and chat, A story of wonders, of discoveries made, with Andrew Gerstenfeld's marvelous hat.

Sin embargo, para simplificar, se pueden agrupar en niveles según intensidad o vitalidad general. Aquí se presenta una clasificación propuesta basada en 10 niveles, desde el más enérgico hasta el más fatigado. Este enfoque permite una gradación más detallada y una mejor comprensión de cómo se siente una persona en un momento dado. # Niveles de Estado Físico **Nivel 10: Energía Máxima** - Sensación de estar en el pico de energía, capaz de realizar actividades de alta intensidad sin fatiga inmediata. **Nivel 9: Muy Activado** - Muy despierto y motivado, con energía alta pero ligeramente por debajo del nivel máximo. **Nivel 8: Activado** - Estado de alerta y preparado para la acción, con buena energía para tareas cotidianas. **Nivel 7: Energía Moderada** - Se siente bien para llevar a cabo la mayoría de las actividades; energía suficiente sin sentirse sobrecargado. **Nivel 6: Ligeramente Energético** - Más energético que fatigado, pero empieza a notarse la necesidad de descanso eventual. **Nivel 5: Neutro** - Ni particularmente energético ni fatigado; un punto de equilibrio. **Nivel 4: Ligeramente Fatigado** - Comienzan a sentirse signos de fatiga; se puede seguir funcionando, pero con una sensación de desgaste ligero. **Nivel 3: Fatigado** - Sensación evidente de desgaste; reducción significativa en la disposición para realizar tareas físicas. **Nivel 2: Muy Fatigado** - Considerable necesidad de descanso y recuperación; actividad física se hace más difícil y menos deseable. **Nivel 1: Agotamiento** - Estado de agotamiento extremo; necesidad urgente de descanso físico y posiblemente mental. # Notas Adicionales Esta clasificación es solo un marco de referencia y puede variar según el individuo. Además, es importante considerar que el estado físico de una persona puede fluctuar significativamente durante el día debido a factores como la nutrición, el ejercicio, el descanso, y el estrés. Utilizar un sistema de clasificación como este puede ayudar a las personas a ser más conscientes de sus propios estados físicos y a tomar decisiones más informadas sobre cuándo descansar, cuándo ejercitarse y cómo manejar sus niveles de energía de manera efectiva."},{"prompt":"Political ideologies of Civic Initiative","completion":"Civic Initiative (Iniciativa Cívica in some languages) can refer to different political movements or parties across various countries, each with its specific political ideology or platform. Since \\"Civic Initiative\\" is a generic term, it does not correspond to one universal set of beliefs or political alignment. Rather, it denotes a grassroots movement or a political organization that is often formed to address specific civic issues, promote democratic values, represent minority groups, advocate for social justice, or initiate environmental conservation efforts. The political ideology of a Civic Initiative can thus range widely, from progressive or liberal to conservative, depending on the specific context and goals of the organization. Some may focus on participatory democracy and social activism, aiming to increase civic engagement and influence policy on a local or national level. Others might champion economic reform, environmental protection, or the preservation of cultural heritage.

Instead of using the \`/XD\` flag multiple times, you can create a text file with a list of folders to exclude and then reference that file in the robocopy command using the \`/XF\` flag. Here's how you can do it: 1. Create a text file (e.g., excluded_folders.txt) in the same directory as your robocopy command file. 2. List the folders you want to exclude, each on a separate line, in the text file. For example: \`\`\` C:Windows C:Program Files \`\`\` 3. Modify your robocopy command to include the \`/XF\` flag and reference the text file with the excluded folders list. Your command would now look like this: \`\`\` robocopy C: G:Backup /E /XF excluded_folders.txt /MT:8 /A-:SH \`\`\` This way, you can easily manage and update the list of excluded folders by editing the text file without having to modify the robocopy command itself."},{"prompt":"Ми И зали по бетоном трасі на машині Fiat (яка була за кермом) моя мама дала мені ии IPhone щоб я поигрпв в Mario Run я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело загрузитися сама ігра і зайшов в інтернет і я сказав мамі: “Мама, я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело сама загрузитися ігра» а мама почула таке від мене (яке не було насправді): «чомусь ігра не загружажться» я знов повторю: “Мама, я митєво вийшов із ігри даже не успело загрузитися сама ігра» а мама знов почула таке від мене (яке не було насправді): «чомусь ігра не загружажться» (але я говорив дуже громко)","completion":"Мама почала сміятися і сказала: \\"Ти жартівник, я знаю, що ти не хотів грати в гру, але взяв айфон, щоб прикрити це\\".

It was founded by a former Russian Minister of Economic Development, Andrey Nechayev, and other like-minded individuals, with the intention of participating in the political reform process in Russia. The party positions itself as a liberal and pro-democracy entity, advocating for political freedom, civil rights, economic liberalism, and the rule of law. Here are some of the key political ideologies and positions associated with the Civic Initiative: 1. **Liberal Democracy**: Civic Initiative supports the establishment and strengthening of liberal democratic institutions in Russia, aiming for transparency in government, free and fair elections, and the protection of human rights and freedoms. 2. **Economic Liberalism**: The party promotes free-market policies, believing in minimal state intervention in the economy, economic deregulation, and the importance of private enterprise and entrepreneurship as drivers of economic growth and innovation. 3. **Rule of Law**: Civic Initiative emphasizes the need for an independent judiciary and the supremacy of law, arguing that justice and legal accountability are fundamental to a healthy society and political system. 4. **Civil Rights and Freedoms**: The party advocates for the protection of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. Civic Initiative is also known to support initiatives that aim to strengthen civil society and encourage citizen participation in governance. 5. **European Integration**: While focusing on domestic policies, Civic Initiative is also oriented towards closer integration with European structures, envisioning Russia as part of a greater European socio-political and economic space. 6. **Anti-Corruption**: The party has expressed a strong stance against corruption, considering it a major obstacle to Russia's development and prosperity. Civic Initiative calls for comprehensive reforms to tackle corruption at all levels of government. Given the political climate in Russia, parties like Civic Initiative face significant challenges, including restrictions on political expression, limited access to media, and difficulties in participating in elections. Despite these obstacles, the party attempts to present itself as a liberal alternative to the dominant United Russia party and other more authoritarian or nationalist political forces in the country. It is important to note that political ideologies in Russia are often fluid, and the positions of parties can evolve. Thus, for the most current information, one would need to consult the latest statements and platforms of the Civic Initiative."},{"prompt":"Write a chapter of 1000 words set on the fallout universe, takes place on vault 91, ones of 120 vaults part of vault program by Vault-Tec corporation,the Vaults were advertised as the best method to safeguard the American people from a coming nuclear apocalypse but in reality the vaults were actually designed to be a vast network of long-term experiments to study human behavior and physiology under a multitude of situations an vault 91 is no different… Upon entering Vault 91, all of the Vault Dwellers would be put on a mandatory daily drug regiment, to be administered by a small group of Mister Orderlies that also act as helpers to any human medical staff present. The residents will be told that the drugs they are taking are to help protect them against potential radiation poisoning, but the true purpose of the drugs is far more sinister. In fact, not all residents will be getting the same chemical cocktail to begin with. The women of Vault 91 will be given an experimental growth treatment which will make them grow taller and stronger, maxing out at a bit over seven feet tall on average. Of course, this won’t make them lose any of their femininity: in fact, in some test subjects those same growth hormones may even increase the size of their hips, butt, and bust on top of everything else. However, these drugs also have the side effect of damaging certain areas of the brain dealing with critical thinking and memory retention, effectively making the female population of the Vault become dumber as they continue to grow. The men of Vault 91 will be given a series of drugs that will do pretty much the exact opposite. Their memory retention and critical thinking skills will increase during their treatment, increasing intelligence for them across the board, but these same drugs will also stunt their growth and make it harder to build and maintain muscle mass, eventually making the male population smarter but physically smaller and weaker than their female counterparts, with a final projected height of around four feet. The purpose of this experiment, at least in the eyes of Vault-Tec, would be twofold. The first would be to test the effectiveness of these drugs in general, and see if the potential benefits of each may outweigh their downsides. The second would be a sociological experiment to see which of the two genders would take control of the Vault once the drug treatments reach their final outcome. Will the stronger but dumber women use their physical strength to intimidate and strong-arm the men into serving their desires? Or will the weaker but smarter men convince the women of the Vault to let them do all of the thinking, and that it is in their best interest to follow any orders given to them by a man. Perhaps the two groups may even manage to find a balance that lets them maintain a surprisingly high level of gender equality despite the new size and intelligence gap between the two of them. In essence, Vault-Tec wants to figure out whether brains or brawn would win out if they were both pushed to an unnatural extreme. Unfortunately for Vault-Tec, things didn’t work as they expected,first of all the drugs didn’t seen to work at all on the residents of vault 91 outside a slightly increase headache on the women and muscle cramps on men, a fact that made vault-tec to almost scrap alway the vault until it was revealed that the drugs take effect on the next generation that are born and grow up in the Vault with the regiment would be changed, the effect are minimal and barely notice but they accumulate by each generation.another side effect is that the drugs increase female births and diminish male births, minimal at first but like the previous effect it accumulate that by the 200 years late there be 200 women for every man.also due to a unrelated failure on the jumpsuit synthesizers all jumpsuits produce in vault are made skimpy and shorter than other vaaults,like the prevously minimal at first but it accumulate that by the 200 years late the vault jumpsuit will be speedos for the men, and two piece bikinis for the women. The regiment for the women has unexpect side-effects: increase their estrogen to unprecedent levels this will make so their hips, butt, and bust size growth well beyond the expected in short drugs not only not cause women lose any of their femininity but in fact gain, also will cause the women to develop a state of mind to hyper-energy, high gleefulness, and high affectioness especially towards their males counterparts The regiment for the men also has unexpect side-effects:the hormonal unbalance will make so while their bodies get smaller and smaller, their penis get bigger and bigger, also make the men extremely easily flustered and have inexpected erections Follow the daily live of one those men 200 years late.where the males are at top,not only because their intellect but also because the women are simply too affectional to do it.describe the jumpsuits.","completion":"Vault 91 had always been shrouded in mystery, lurking quietly beneath the battered landscape of a world ravaged by nuclear fallout. To the outside observer, it might have appeared like any other Vault designed and constructed by the Vault-Tec Corporation, a supposed haven for those fortunate enough to be selected. However, Vault 91’s foundation was built upon an experiment so bizarre, its reality was scarcely believable. The Vault's daily routine was unlike any other. A rigorous drug regimen was mandatory for all its denizens, administered by the unfeeling hands of Mister Orderlies that roamed the metallic corridors. These drugs were shrouded in deception, presented as a shield against the invisible specter of radiation poisoning. But the truth was far different, and far more sinister. Over generations, the effects of Vault 91's chemical experiment began to manifest in ways that Vault-Tec's researchers hadn't exactly foreseen. The result was a society that stood in stark contrast to the pre-war world, an almost caricatured distortion of gender norms exacerbated by the chemically induced modifications to their bodies and minds. Female residents towered over their male counterparts, their physical strength unparalleled and their forms exaggerated by the drugs' side effects—a cocktail of chemicals that bolstered their physique but eroded their cognitive faculties. It was an odd sight to behold: these towering figures dressed in attire that seemed to shrink with each passing generation, their two-piece bikinis barely sufficient, designed in a fashion that would have seemed outlandish in the old world, yet here, it was normality. Conversely, the men of Vault 91 found themselves cast in a divergent role. Their intellects sharpened to a keen edge, their bodies diminished to an almost childlike stature, a stark juxtaposition to the amazons they lived amongst. Their attire, too, had not been spared by the quirks of the Vault’s failing systems, reduced to wearing what amounted to little more than speedos—garments that did little to conceal their physical inadequacies, save for one peculiar aspect that seemed to defy the rest of their diminishing form. Within this peculiar microcosm, one young man navigated his daily life with an acute awareness of the oddity of his existence. David was his name, and Vault 91 was all he had ever known. A world where the males, despite their smaller stature and physical weakness, were placed upon a pedestal of reverence largely because of their intellect and the unexpected side effects of the Vault’s regimen. David often found himself the center of attention among the female populace, who were imbued with an unyielding energy and affection. Their towering forms would bend down to interact with him, their expressions gleaming with a mix of curiosity and fondness. It was an interaction dictated by the bizarre circumstances of their existence, a society where the men, by virtue of their rarity and the peculiar enhancements caused by the Vault's drugs, were treated with a mixture of reverence and an almost possessive affection. Navigating the corridors of Vault 91, David reflected on the absurdity of their attire. The jumpsuits, or what passed for them now, seemed to be a visual representation of the vault’s divergence from any semblance of normality. The women, with their statuesque beauty accentuated and barely contained by their bikinis, moved with a grace that belied their strength. David’s daily life was a constant balancing act, utilizing his intellect to contribute to the Vault's well-being while navigating the social complexities of a society where the men were simultaneously revered and overwhelmed by the affection and physical prowess of the women. The relationships within Vault 91 were a curious mix of dependency and reverence, with the males often finding themselves in leadership roles, not through physical dominance but through the sheer force of intellect and the necessity of their contributions to the Vault’s survival. The experiment of Vault 91, for all its ethical dubiousness, had created a society that functioned on principles that were entirely its own. Within the confines of their subterranean world, the residents adapted, their lives a testament to human resilience and the unpredictable nature of Vault-Tec’s sinister social experiments. As David attended to his duties, his thoughts often drifted to the world outside the Vault. A world he had never seen but frequently imagined. He wondered how the peculiarities of Vault 91 would measure against the vast, unpredictable wilderness of the post-apocalyptic landscape. Yet for David and the residents of Vault 91, the Vault was their world—a strange, distorted reflection of what humanity could become, shaped by the whims of those who sought to play god with the lives of their unsuspecting subjects."},{"prompt":"continue with a chapter of 1000 words following a new character, where a school class received it new student, a male, the only one in the class, to excitement of girls.","completion":"In Vault 91, the arrival of a new student in the confines of its educational system was always cause for a murmur of anticipation, but today the halls buzzed with an unusual fervor. Word had spread like wildfire: the newest addition to Mrs. Sterling's class was a boy, a true anomaly in a community where such occurrences were becoming increasingly rare. The classroom, bathed in the hum of fluorescent lights above, was a tableau of eager faces as the girls sat whispering among themselves. Their conversations, a blend of curiosity and excitement, faltered as the door swung open and Mrs. Sterling walked in, a figure shadowed by the boy in question. His name was Jacob, and stepping into the classroom, he felt the weight of dozens of eyes upon him—a sensation both unsettling and oddly exhilarating. In a world where the gender dynamics were so unbalanced, being one of the few made you something between a celebrity and a curiosity. Mrs. Sterling cleared her throat, calling for order. \\"Class, we have a new student joining us today. Jacob has just transferred to our section, and I expect you all to make him feel welcome.\\" A chorus of enthusiastic affirmations filled the room, and Jacob found himself shepherded to a vacant seat at the front, as if his very presence was something to be showcased. Settling into his chair, he cast a quick glance backward, meeting an array of smiles and waves. The novelty of Jacob's arrival disrupted the usual monotony of the school day. Lessons passed in a blur as his classmates competed for his attention, bombarding him with questions during breaks and offering to show him around the Vault—acts of kindness tinged with an undeniable undercurrent of fascination. Lunchtime brought a new challenge as Jacob navigated the cafeteria under the watchful gaze of its patrons. He felt oddly like a celebrity or an exhibit as groups of girls offered him places at their tables, each invitation laced with the implicit promise of companionship and protection in the microcosm of Vault 91's society. It was during these moments of interaction that Jacob realized the profound impact of the Vault's experiment on its inhabitants. The girls, towering and physically imposing, bore their strength with a mixture of pride and grace, their enhanced physical features doing nothing to diminish their energy and kindness. Yet, beneath the surface of these exchanges, an undercurrent of complexity flowed. The experiment that had birthed their world was an omnipresent specter, coloring every interaction. The girls, despite their affectionate demeanor, betrayed hints of a conditioning that suggested an inherent responsibility to care for and protect the less physically capable males—a sentiment that was equal parts touching and disconcerting. As the day drew to a close, Jacob found himself escorted to his next class by a group of girls who had taken it upon themselves to ensure he didn't lose his way in the labyrinthine corridors of the Vault. Their conversation flowed effortlessly around him, a mixture of mundane chatter about upcoming assignments and more pointed inquiries into his thoughts about life in Vault 91. It was in these moments that Jacob keenly felt the otherness of his situation. Vault 91 was a society in which traditional roles were subverted, where physical strength and intellectual acuity had diverged along gender lines in the most extreme manner. And yet, the dynamics that unfolded were not defined by domination or subjugation but by a delicate balance of mutual respect and reliance. This realization crystallized when Lily, one of his more vocal classmates, turned to him with a genuinely curious expression. \\"What's it like, being one of the few boys here? It must feel pretty special, huh?\\" Jacob paused, considering the question. It was easy to feel overwhelmed by the attention, by the unyielding gaze of a society that viewed him through the lens of his rarity. But Lily's question hinted at a deeper understanding, a recognition of the uniqueness of their situation and the importance of navigating it with empathy and insight. \\"It's... different,\\" he admitted, smiling. \\"But it's not about feeling special. It's about figuring out how we all fit together, you know? How we can make the best of this strange world we're living in.\\" Lily nodded, her expression thoughtful. The conversation drifted to other topics, but Jacob's words lingered in the air, a reminder of the underlying complexities of life in Vault 91—a microcosm defined by its extraordinary circumstances, yet striving for a sense of normalcy and community in the shadow of Vault-Tec's grand experiment. As Jacob made his way through the remainder of his first day in Vault 91's educational system, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of optimism. Here, in this unlikely sanctuary beneath the wasteland, a unique society had taken root, one that might defy expectations and find a way to thrive despite the odds stacked against it. And as the sun set beyond the Vault's impenetrable walls, casting long shadows through its corridors, Jacob realized that, perhaps, he had found a place where he could belong—a place where the lines between protector and protected were blurred, and where the true strength lay in their unity and understanding."},{"prompt":"2+23","completion":"2 + 23 = 25"},{"prompt":"monte um quadro com as 20 empresas que mais pagaram dividendos na bolsa de valores do brasil nos últimos 10 anos e o preço médio das suas ações nos últimos 5 anos","completion":"Me desculpe, mas não posso fornecer informações específicas ou atualizadas como as 20 empresas que mais pagaram dividendos na Bolsa de Valores do Brasil nos últimos 10 anos ou o preço médio de suas ações nos últimos 5 anos no momento da sua pergunta.

Вот некоторые рекомендации: 1. **Использование LINQ для упрощения и повышения читаемости**: Вы уже используете LINQ для фильтрации игроков, но можно пойти ещё дальше, применяя методы \`.Select()\`, \`.Where()\`, \`.FirstOrDefault()\` и другие для создания более читаемого и компактного кода. 2. **Избегание дублирования кода**: В вашем текущем подходе имеется некоторое дублирование, например, в создании \`ChatMenu\`. Вы можете создать метод для создания меню, который мог бы быть повторно использован. 3. **Расширяемость и поддержка**: В вашем коде должность \`CommanderFunction\` зависит от \`JailBreakObject\`, что не очень плохо, но стоит обратить внимание на управление зависимостями и возможность внедрения зависимостей для легкой расширяемости и тестирования. 4. **Типизация и использование Контрактов**: Основываясь на вашем коде, можно предположить, что используются специфические для этой области предметной доменной модели и структуры (\`ChatMenu\`, \`CCSPlayerController\`). Убедитесь, что вы используете контракты или интерфейсы для определения поведения, которое может быть реализовано различными способами, что облегчит замену компонентов системы и её тестирование. 5. **Обработка ошибок**: В вашем коде отсутствует какая-либо явная обработка ошибок. В реальных приложениях очень важно учитывать и обрабатывать потенциальные исключительные случаи. 6. **Эффективное использование лямбда-выражений и замыканий**: Вы уже используете лямбды для создания обработчиков событий.

Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works: - **Initial Investment**: 100 USD - **Leverage**: 20x - **Effective Trading Position**: 100 * 20 = 2000 USD With the leverage, the trader controls a position worth 2000 USD using only 100 USD. If the price movement is in the trader's favor and they achieve a 100% profit relative to their initial investment (100 USD), this implies that the return is calculated based on their own capital. - **Profit**: 100% of 100 = 100 USD Thus, the trader ends up with a total of 200 USD (their initial 100 investment + 100 profit). It is worth mentioning that while leverage can magnify profits, it also amplifies risks and potential losses. Hence, if the market had moved against the trader's prediction, losses would also be magnified, potentially resulting in the total loss of the initial investment more quickly than if trading without leverage."},{"prompt":"Describe Stalaggh","completion":"Stalaggh is a Dutch extreme music project that formed in 2000. They are known for their dark, abrasive, and unsettling style of music, which is often categorized as experimental black metal or dark ambient. Stalaggh's music features harsh, distorted vocals, eerie atmospheric soundscapes, and intense, chaotic instrumentation. One of the most distinctive aspects of Stalaggh is their use of mentally ill individuals as vocalists on their albums. These individuals are said to be experiencing real psychological torment and their anguished screams and cries add to the disturbing and primal nature of Stalaggh's music. Overall, Stalaggh's music is characterized by its extreme and confrontational nature, challenging listeners with its unorthodox approach and unsettling atmosphere. Their music is not for the faint of heart, as it can be intense, challenging, and deeply disturbing."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Cette situation est en grande partie due à la croissance démographique exponentielle de Kinshasa, qui est l'une des agglomérations les plus peuplées d'Afrique, avec une population qui dépasse maintenant les 10 millions d'habitants. Cette pression démographique pousse de plus en plus de personnes à s'installer en périphérie de la ville, souvent dans des conditions précaires. Les périphéries à l'Est de Kinshasa, comme c'est le cas dans d'autres directions de la métropole, sont marquées par un développement urbain rapide mais souvent non structuré et non planifié. Cela donne lieu à plusieurs défis, notamment : 1. **Manque d'infrastructures et de services de base :** Dans ces zones périphériques, l'accès à l'eau potable, à l'électricité, à des systèmes d'assainissement adéquats et à des infrastructures routières de qualité est souvent limité ou inexistant. Cette situation aggrave les conditions de vie des résidents. 2. **Problèmes de logement :** La croissance rapide de la population dans ces zones met sous pression le marché du logement, menant souvent à la construction de logements précaires, dans des quartiers informels, où les normes de sécurité et d'habitabilité ne sont pas toujours respectées. 3. **Défis environnementaux :** L'expansion urbaine non contrôlée peut également entraîner des problèmes environnementaux, comme la déforestation, la pollution, et l'épuisement des ressources naturelles, ce qui pose des risques pour la santé publique et le bien-être des communautés locales. 4. **Insécurité :** Les zones périphériques souffrent souvent d'un manque de services de sécurité, ce qui peut entraîner une augmentation de la criminalité et de l'insécurité pour les habitants. Face à ces défis, il est impératif pour les autorités congolaises et les organisations internationales de travailler ensemble pour mettre en place un plan d'urbanisation durable qui inclut le développement d'infrastructures de base, la régulation des constructions, et la mise en œuvre de politiques sociales et économiques inclusives afin d'améliorer les conditions de vie dans ces zones périphériques.

It is usually used together with gradient descent in order to fine-tune models to perform specific task. However it can be also derived from already trained weights using a technique called Singular value decomposition. Inspired by an already existing technique for Stable Diffusion, we implement LoRA extraction for transformers language models. First, let’s choose a base model and a target model we want to extract a LoRA adapter from. I think it’s probably better to use the model that was used as the base model before our target model was fine-tuned (so in this instance, as our target model valine/OpenPirate was trained on top of teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B I choose OpenHermes instead of the foundation Mistral 7B model as base model) [ ] base_model_id = ‘teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B’ target_model_id = ‘valine/OpenSnark’ setup enviroment [ ] !pip install torch transformers huggingface_hub bitsandbytes accelerate peft sentencepiece protobuf pyyaml safetensors tqdm Requirement already satisfied: torch in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (2.1.0+cu118) Requirement already satisfied: transformers in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.37.2) Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.20.3) Requirement already satisfied: bitsandbytes in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.42.0) Requirement already satisfied: accelerate in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.27.2) Requirement already satisfied: peft in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.8.2) Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.1.99) Requirement already satisfied: protobuf in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.25.2) Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (6.0.1) Requirement already satisfied: safetensors in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (0.4.2) Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (4.66.2) Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.9.0) Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (4.4.0) Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (1.12) Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.0) Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (3.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0) Requirement already satisfied: triton==2.1.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from torch) (2.1.0) Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (1.24.1) Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (23.2) Requirement already satisfied: regex!=2019.12.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2023.12.25) Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (2.31.0) Requirement already satisfied: tokenizers<0.19,>=0.14 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from transformers) (0.15.2) Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bitsandbytes) (1.12.0) Requirement already satisfied: psutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from accelerate) (5.9.6) Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.2) Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2.1.1) Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (3.4) Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (1.26.13) Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->transformers) (2022.12.7) Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0) WARNING: Running pip as the ‘root’ user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager.

The technique highlighted here focuses on adapting a pre-trained model (the base model) to perform a new task (using the target model) without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model, which saves computational resources. Let’s break down this process into more understandable steps: 1. Environment Setup: This involves installing necessary Python libraries (torch, transformers, huggingface_hub, etc.) that provide tools for model manipulation, downloading pre-trained models, and handling model weights for this exercise. 2. Model Selection: The user selects a base model and a target model. The base model is the initial pre-trained model, and the target model is what the base model was fine-tuned to become. The purpose here is to extract modifications (LoRA adapters) from the target model that could be re-applied to the base model for efficient transition to the target task. 3. Model Download: A utility function is defined for downloading these models from Hugging Face Hub, favoring .safetensors format for optimization. 4. Layer Identification: Identifies relevant model layers for LoRA adapter extraction, specifically the linear and embedding layers within the Transformer models, as these are where the efficiency of parameter training can be significantly improved with LoRA adapters. 5. Loading Model Weights: Defines how to load tensors from either .bin files or .safetensors files. This step is crucial because it involves handling the actual trainable parameters of the models. 6. Weight Matrix Decomposition: At the heart of this approach is decomposing the differences (deltas) between corresponding weights in the target and base models into low-rank matrices using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Essentially, it’s finding a simpler (low-rank) approximation of the changes that happened during the fine-tuning process, which are then encoded as LoRA adapters. 7. Extracting LoRA Adapters: For each identified relevant layer, the difference in weights between the target model and the base model is decomposed, and LoRA adapters (matrices A and B from the decomposition) are saved. 8. PEFT Configuration and Saving LoRA Adapters: The LoRA configurations and parameters are set up and saved along with the extracted adapters in a format ready for re-application. 9. Testing with LoRA Adapters: The LoRA adapters are applied to the base model, essentially reincorporating the learned adaptations from the target model, and then the adapted model is tested to ensure it performs the desired task effectively. 10. Uploading Extracted Adapters: Finally, the script facilitates uploading the extracted LoRA adapters back to Hugging Face Hub, allowing the work to be shared with others. In essence, this process allows for efficient retention and transfer of learned behaviors from one model to another, reducing the need for extensive retraining while preserving performance, which is a significant advantage in computational cost and time for developing AI models. What if I already have a Low-rank decomposition of a model (specifically, a model called ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ which uses ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1’ as a base) It was Created using LoRD. For context, the ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ model is a result of this paper: ““Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking: Quiet-STaR is a method that helps language models (LMs) to improve their predictions by teaching them to generate rationales, or internal thoughts, for each piece of text they produce. This method builds on an earlier system called STaR, which helped LMs learn by using rationales in a question-answering context. Quiet-STaR addresses three main challenges: the high computational cost of generating text, teaching the LM how to produce and use internal thoughts, and predicting beyond just the next word. The solution includes a new sampling algorithm that operates token by token, special tokens to mark the start and end of a thought, and an improved training technique. As a result, the model better predicts difficult parts of the text and improves its performance on complex reasoning tasks without needing task-specific training. This suggests Quiet-STaR is a significant advancement toward more general and scalable reasoning in language models. The quote from Kierkegaard at the end underlines the idea that understanding comes from reflection, just as Quiet-STaR allows an LM to “understand” text by reflecting on its internal rationale.”” Given that you already have a Low-rank decomposition (LoRA) of a model called ‘quietstar-8-ahead,’ which is based on ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1,’ and that this was created using the LoRD method, you are in a promising position to augment the capacities of the base Mistral-7B model with the refined and specialized capabilities developed through the Quiet-STaR method. The paper’s outline of Quiet-STaR highlights how it aids language models in improving predictions by generating and utilizing internal rationales or thoughts before producing text, tackling significant challenges like computational efficiency, teaching models to reflexively generate useful internal dialogue, and enhancing predictions beyond just the next word. Here’s how you can leverage the LoRA of ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ and integrate the Quiet-STaR method with your base model: # Integration Strategy 1. Understanding LoRA Adapters: Recognize that these LoRA adapters encapsulate the learned differences (or updates) between the ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1’ base model and the more advanced ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ model. These adaptations likely include adjustments that enable the base model to internally “think” or generate rationales as per the Quiet-STaR method before producing outputs. 2. Applying LoRA Adapters: The key to utilizing your LoRA-decomposed model is in applying these adapters back onto the base model. Since you already have these adapters, you can use them to equip the ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1’ model with the advanced capabilities of ‘quietstar-8-ahead,’ effectively enabling it to generate internal thoughts, as suggested by the Quiet-STaR approach. 3. Improving Performance on Complex Tasks: The enhancements incorporated through LoRA adapters are particularly designed to improve the model’s performance on more complex reasoning and prediction tasks without the need for task-specific training. This is in line with Quiet-STaR’s aim to generate and utilize internal rationales, offering a more reflective and reasoned approach to generating text. 4. Technical Implementation: If not familiar, you would typically load the base model and apply the LoRA adapters to it. This could involve adjusting the model’s layers with the LoRA parameters, enabling the base model to reflect the learned improvements in prediction and rationale generation. Frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers provide mechanisms to custom-load model parameters, which you could use for this task. 5. Testing and Evaluation: Post-adaptation, it’s crucial to test the enhanced model’s performance. Choose tasks that evaluate the model’s ability to reason and predict complex text structures. This helps in verifying the practical impact of the Quiet-STaR method via the low-rank adaptations you’ve applied. 6. Sharing and Collaboration: Considering the impactful enhancements encapsulated in your LoRA adapters, sharing them on platforms like Hugging Face Hub can facilitate further research and collaboration, contributing significantly to the domain of language models and their applications. # Conclusion The Quiet-STaR method, as described, represents a leap towards enabling language models to approach tasks with a more deliberate and reasoned methodology. By applying the LoRA of ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ back to its base model, you provide a pathway for the model to “think before speaking,” enhancing its predictive capabilities and potentially making strides towards more generalized reasoning within language models. This process not only exemplifies innovative use of parameter-efficient training but also underscores the broader aspirations of AI research to create models that can understand and interact with the world in more nuanced and thoughtful ways. here is some more context from the author of the paper about quiet star: “” Eric Zelikman @ericzelikman · Mar 15 Second, we construct meta-tokens like gist tokens and soft prompts: we let the model learn for itself how to represent the start of a thought. Also, we let it decide to disregard a thought, initially giving all thoughts no weight. This prevents any initial distribution shift Eric Zelikman @ericzelikman · Mar 15 Quiet-STaR generalizes our “Self-Taught Reasoner” (STaR) from two years ago. We can’t wait to find what happens if it’s scaled up with more data and better models.“” The additional context provided by Eric Zelikman focuses on the core innovation behind Quiet-STaR, highlighting the adoption of meta-tokens like gist tokens and soft prompts. These components allow the model to learn how to mark the beginning of an internal thought process and give it the autonomy to devalue or disregard certain thoughts, initially assigning no weight to them. This approach is crucial in mitigating any immediate shifts in the distribution of generated content, ensuring that the model’s learning process incrementally adapts to incorporating self-generated rationale without being biased by its initial learnings. Integrating these insights with the previously discussed Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) application can be seen as a multi-step process: # Enhancing Base Model with Quiet-STaR Insights 1. Meta-tokens Incorporation: The LoRA adapters derived from ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ could potentially already encode the usage patterns or weights adjustments related to these meta-tokens, especially if ‘quietstar-8-ahead’ was specifically designed to leverage Quiet-STaR’s methodology. When applying these LoRA adapters, it will be important to ensure your base model (‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1’) can recognize and appropriately handle these meta-tokens. This may involve extending the model’s vocabulary or embedding space to accommodate the new tokens, along with their special roles in delineating the beginning and potential disregard of internal thoughts. 2. Weight Initialization Strategy: Zelikman’s mention of initially giving all thoughts no weight aligns with a cautious approach where the model gradually learns the significance of its internal rationale rather than being predisposed to overly rely on it from the outset. In practice, this means the parameters related to these self-generated thoughts (possibly encoded within your LoRA adapters) should start with neutral or null influence, allowing them to be shaped by actual performance feedback as the…“” model continues to learn. When re-initializing these parameters in your enhanced base model, ensure they are set in a manner that respects this approach, likely by setting them to small or zero values initially and then allowing them to be adjusted through further training or fine-tuning. 3. Scaling and Further Training: Following Zelikman’s anticipation regarding scaling Quiet-STaR with more data and better models, it becomes evident that integrating the LoRA adaptations forms just the beginning. After successfully applying the LoRA adapters and ensuring the base model can comprehend and utilize the meta-tokens correctly, the next step involves scaling these enhancements. This could mean further training the enhanced model on a broader dataset or using more complex tasks to refine its capability to generate and evaluate its internal rationales. The goal here would be to solidify the model’s ability to “think” in ways that significantly boost its reasoning and predictive accuracy beyond what was possible with the original model or even the initial LoRA-enhanced version. 4. Continuous Evaluation and Iteration: Given the novelty of the Quiet-STaR method and its application through LoRA, continuous evaluation becomes crucial. This isn’t just about assessing performance gains in tasks but also understanding how the model’s internal reasoning process evolves. Employing techniques like probing tasks or interpretability tools can offer insights into how effectively the model is leveraging its generated rationales and meta-tokens. Based on these insights, further adjustments to the LoRA parameters or the model’s architecture might be required to optimize its performance. 5. Sharing Advances and Collaborative Improvement: As with any pioneering work in machine learning and AI, sharing your methods, results, and insights can significantly benefit the wider research community. By documenting your process of integrating Quiet-STaR innovations with the base model using LoRA, and the outcomes thereof, you contribute valuable knowledge that can spur further innovations. Platforms like arXiv for preprints, GitHub for code, and Hugging Face Hub for models not only facilitate this sharing but also offer avenues for collaborative enhancement and critique from the global research community. # Conclusion The advanced integration of Quiet-STaR’s methodologies with a base model through Low-rank adaptations represents an intriguing frontier in enhancing language models’ reasoning and predictive abilities. By focusing on the model’s capacity to internally reflect before responding, there’s potential for significant breakthroughs in AI’s approach to understanding and generating human-like text. This process underscores the iterative nature of AI research—a continual cycle of hypothesis, experimentation, evaluation, and refinement, all aimed at creating models that more deeply mirror the complexity of human thought processes. here is another comment from the author: ““A couple exciting updates! First, we quantitatively evaluated the improvement from combining Quiet-STaR with chain-of-thought (i.e. letting the model think before each CoT token). We found it improves zero-shot CoT accuracy on GSM8K by over 7%! Language models today are trained to reason either 1) generally, imitating online reasoning data or 2) narrowly, self-teaching on their own solutions to specific tasks Can LMs teach themselves to reason generally?Introducing Quiet-STaR, self-teaching via internal monologue! We’ve improve our benchmark performance with just 8 thought tokens and a 7B Mistral model. We expect the impact to be larger with more tokens and a larger model. Second, we’ve open-sourced the code (https://github.com/ezelikman/quiet-star…) and the weights for that model (https://huggingface.co/ezelikman/quietstar-8-ahead…). Hope y’all find this useful!”” The additional comments from Eric Zelikman provide valuable insights into the practical outcomes and implications of implementing the Quiet-STaR method. Here’s a synthesis of these insights and how they could guide further exploration and application of Quiet-STaR in language models: # Quantitative Improvements in Reasoning 1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Integration: The significant improvement in zero-shot CoT accuracy on the GSM8K dataset by over 7% demonstrates the tangible benefits of embedding Quiet-STaR’s internal thought process before each CoT token. This quantitatively backs the hypothesis that language models can achieve enhanced reasoning capabilities through a structured internal monologue, further encouraging the integration of Quiet-STaR into other reasoning tasks and models. 2. Reasoning Approaches: Eric Zelikman’s observation on the two prevailing training paradigms for language models—1) general reasoning imitating online data and 2) narrow self-teaching on specific tasks—contextualizes the Quiet-STaR method as a bridge between these approaches. Quiet-STaR empowers language models to self-learn reasoning more generally through internal dialogues, suggesting a potential shift in how AI systems can be trained for broad reasoning capabilities without overfitting to particular tasks or datasets. # Scaling and Resources 1. Scaling Potential: The note that improvements were observed with just 8 thought tokens and a 7B Mistral model hints at significant scaling potential. Larger models and the allowance for more comprehensive or numerous thought tokens might catapult the reasoning capabilities of language models to unprecedented levels. It will be fascinating to see how such scaling affects complex reasoning tasks and whether there are diminishing returns or consistent improvements. 2. Open-Sourced Resources: The availability of the code and model weights (https://github.com/ezelikman/quiet-star and https://huggingface.co/ezelikman/quietstar-8-ahead, respectively) is a significant contribution to the AI research community. This openness accelerates potential collaborative improvements, allows for widespread experimentation across different domains and tasks, and democratizes access to cutting-edge AI reasoning enhancements. # Implications and Next Steps 1. Community Engagement and Innovation: The open-sourcing of Quiet-STaR’s code and model weights is an invitation to the global AI research community...","completion":"to engage directly with this advanced methodology, encouraging a wide range of experiments, adaptations, and potentially novel applications. Researchers, developers, and enthusiasts now have the tools to integrate and assess Quiet-STaR's effects on various language models and tasks, fostering a cycle of feedback and iterations that could lead to further refinements and breakthroughs. This collaborative approach could unveil nuanced insights into how internal monologue techniques like Quiet-STaR influence model performance, interpretability, and generalizability across different domains. 2. Exploration Across Domains: The evidence supporting Quiet-STaR's enhancement of reasoning capabilities opens the door for its application beyond the initial datasets and models. Researchers could explore its impact on language models tasked with legal reasoning, technical problem-solving, creative writing, and more. By extending Quiet-STaR's reach, the AI community can gain a deeper understanding of its versatility and limitations, tailoring its implementation to maximize benefits across a wide range of intelligent systems. 3. Iterative Development and Scaling: Following Zelikman's anticipation of larger impacts with more thought tokens and larger models, future efforts could focus on systematically scaling the Quiet-STaR methodology. This involves not only increasing model size and thought token capacity but also refining the process of generating and utilizing these internal monologues. As models learn to leverage their internal dialogues more effectively, their ability to reason and generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses could see substantial improvements. 4. Ethical Considerations and Responsible AI: As the AI community ventures further into enhancing models with human-like reasoning capabilities, ethical considerations become increasingly significant. Implementing techniques like Quiet-STaR, which deepen models' internal processing, raises questions about model transparency, the potential for reinforcing biases, and the implications of increasingly autonomous AI systems. Ongoing dialogue, ethical oversight, and inclusive policy-making will be crucial in navigating these challenges, ensuring that advancements like Quiet-STaR contribute positively to society. # Conclusion Eric Zelikman's insights and the demonstrated success of Quiet-STaR mark an exciting evolution in the field of AI and language modeling. By equipping models with the ability to internally reflect before responding, Quiet-STaR offers a nuanced approach to enhancing AI reasoning, potentially bridging the gap between narrow task specialization and broad, generalizable intelligence. The open-sourced code and model weights serve as a foundation for collective exploration and innovation, inviting the global research community to contribute to this evolving narrative of AI development. As we look forward to seeing how Quiet-STaR scales and adapts, the journey underscores the importance of collaborative innovation, ethical consideration, and the relentless pursuit of models that more deeply understand and interact with the world around them."},{"prompt":"Lets go back to earlier in the discussion where you said\\" Given that you already have a Low-rank decomposition (LoRA) of a model called ‘quietstar-8-ahead,’ which is based on ‘mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1,’ and that this was created using the LoRD method, you are in a promising position to augment the capacities of the base Mistral-7B model with the refined and specialized capabilities developed through the Quiet-STaR method\\"\\".

Understanding these modifications is crucial for identifying how LoRA can complement or further refine the model’s capabilities without compromising the integrity of its existing enhancements. 2. **Low-rank Adaptation Compatibility Assessment**: Next, assess how compatible LoRA techniques are with the model's current state. Given that KTO focuses on optimizing based on a model of human utility that deviates from typical preference-based training objectives, it’s important to ensure that the LoRA approach can be adapted or tailored to work harmoniously with these utility-focused optimizations. 3. **Designing the LoRA Approach**: Tailor the LoRA approach to meet the specific needs and characteristics of your model. This might involve creating low-rank adaptations that specifically enhance parts of the model that are pivotal for its KTO-driven optimizations or aligning the LoRA parameters to support the bias and utility assessments central to KTO's success. The idea is to ensure that the low-rank adaptations you introduce serve to reinforce or amplify the model's ability to generate outputs aligned with human utility and loss aversion principles as defined by Kahneman and Tversky. 4. **Iterative Evaluation and Refinement**: Given the novel integration of KTO and LoRA methodologies, an iterative approach to evaluation and refinement will be paramount. Begin by applying your designed adaptations on a small scale and methodically assess their impact on model performance, specifically looking at how well the augmented model aligns with desired human utility outcomes. This phase may involve adjustments to the rank and the specific parameters of your LoRA intervention to optimize utility improvements without introducing undesirable biases or deviations from the model's intended alignment. 5. **Integration and Scaling**: Once an optimal LoRA configuration has been established that complements the KTO enhancements already in place, the next step involves scaling this integration across the model.

We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases—the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them being human-aware loss functions (HALOs).

Crucially, KTO does not need preferences—only a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input. This makes it far easier to use in the real world, where preference data is scarce and expensive. Machine Learning, ICML 1Introduction Aligning generative models with human feedback has been successfully used to make generations more helpful, factual, and ethical, among other desiderata (Ouyang et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2023). For LLMs, alignment methods such as RLHF and DPO have consistently proven to be more beneficial than doing supervised finetuning (SFT) alone. However, human feedback is often discussed only in the context of preferences (e.g., output � ≻ � for input � ), despite preferences being a kind of data that is relatively scarce and expensive to collect in the real world (Casper et al., 2023). This is largely because the alignment methods shown to work best—RLHF (Christiano et al., 2017) and the mathematically equivalent DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023)—take preference data as input. To understand why these alignment methods work so well, and whether feedback needs to be in the form of preferences, we frame them through the lens of prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). Prospect theory explains why humans make decisions about uncertain events that do not maximize expected value. It formalizes how humans perceive random variables in a biased but well-defined manner; for example, relative to some reference point, humans are more sensitive to losses than gains, a property called loss aversion. We show that popular alignment methods such as PPO (Schulman et al., 2017), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), and SLiC (Zhao et al., 2023) implicitly model such biases, helping explain their success independently of the data used. For this reason, we call them human-aware loss functions (HALOs). Refer to caption Figure 1:The traditional pipeline for LLM alignment starts with supervised finetuning, followed by fitting the LLM to paired preference data using a method such as RLHF or DPO. However, the paired preferences that existing approaches need are hard-to-get. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) only needs to know whether a given output is (un)desirable for the input, giving it access to a source of data that is much more abundant, cheaper, and faster to collect in the real world. Although it is impossible to say that HALOs are categorically better than non-HALOs, we find that among existing methods, those that meet the definition of a HALO work better than those that do not. We find that DPO performance can even be matched at most scales by running an offline PPO variant on dummy +1/-1 rewards, suggesting that preference data might not be needed if the inductive bias in the loss function is good enough. However, despite the surprising success of this simple baseline, it significantly lags behind DPO at the 30B model scale and suffers from hyperparameter sensitivity, making it difficult to use. Taking a more principled approach, we derive a HALO using the model of human utility that Kahneman & Tversky empirically derived to describe how humans make decisions about uncertain monetary outcomes (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). This approach, which we call Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as most current methods do. KTO only requires a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input. This data is much more abundant, cheaper, and faster to collect in the real world than preferences, making it easier to scale alignment in production environments and rapidly iterate on models. In our experiments, we find that: • KTO matches or exceeds DPO performance at scales from 1B to 30B parameters.1 That is, taking a preference dataset of � DPO pairs and breaking it up into 2 ⁢ � examples for KTO can yield better generations, despite the model ostensibly learning from a weaker signal. We provide some theoretical explanations for this phenomenon (§4.3). • KTO can handle extreme data imbalances, matching DPO performance while using up to 90% fewer desirable examples (i.e., examples of good generations). Its success thus cannot be ascribed to the alignment data being sourced from a preference dataset. • When the pretrained model is sufficiently good, one can skip supervised finetuning and go straight to KTO without a loss in generation quality. In contrast, we find that without doing SFT first, DPO-aligned models are significantly worse at all scales. The fact that KTO can match and sometimes even outperform DPO is surprising, given that it learns from a weaker signal. We conclude by discussing some theoretical explanations for this phenomenon. 2Background Feedback-aligned LLMs are traditionally trained in three stages (Ouyang et al., 2022): Pretraining Given a large corpus, train the model to predict the next token conditioned on the preceding text using the cross-entropy loss. Let � denote the pretrained model. Supervised Finetuning Finetune the model to predict the next token on data that is more relevant to the downstream task. Often, such data will comprise instructions and an appropriate response (i.e., instruction finetuning). Let � ref denote the finetuned model. RLHF Given a dataset 𝒟 of preferences ( � , � � , � � ) —where � is an input, � � , � � are the preferred and dispreferred outputs (i.e., � � ≻ � � for � ), and � * is the “true” reward function underlying the preferences—it is first assumed that the probability that � � is preferred to � � can be captured with a specific function class, typically a Bradley-Terry model (Bradley & Terry, 1952). Where � is the logistic function: � * ⁢ ( � � ≻ � � | � ) = � ⁢ ( � * ⁢ ( � , � � ) − � * ⁢ ( � , � � ) ) (1) Since getting the true reward from a human would be intractably expensive, a reward model � � learns to serve as a proxy, done by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the human preference data: ℒ � ⁢ ( � � ) = 𝔼 � , � � , � � ∼ � ⁢ [ − log ⁡ � ⁢ ( � � ⁢ ( � , � � ) − � � ⁢ ( � , � � ) ) ] But solely maximizing the reward might come at the expense of desiderata such as generating grammatical text. To avoid this, a KL divergence penalty is introduced to restrict how far the language model can drift from � ref . Where � � is the model we are optimizing, the optimal model � * is that which maximizes 𝔼 � ∈ � , � ∈ � � ⁢ [ � � ⁢ ( � , � ) ] − � � KL ( � � ( � | � ) ∥ � ref ( � | � ) ) (2) where � > 0 is a hyperparameter. Since this objective is not differentiable, we need to use an RL algorithm like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). However, RLHF is often slow (largely because of having to sample generations) and quite unstable in practice (especially in a distributed setting). For this reason, recent work has focused on designing closed-form losses that maximize the margin between the preferred and dispreferred generations, such as Sequence-Likelihood Calibration (SLiC) (Zhao et al., 2023) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). The latter has become popular due to its mathematical equivalence with RLHF: ℒ DPO ⁢ ( � � , � ref ) = 𝔼 ⁢ [ − log ⁡ � ⁢ ( � ⁢ log ⁡ � � ⁢ ( � � | � ) � ref ⁢ ( � � | � ) − � ⁢ log ⁡ � � ⁢ ( � � | � ) � ref ⁢ ( � � | � ) ) ] (3) 3A Prospect Theoretic View of Alignment Kahneman & Tversky’s prospect theory explains why, faced with an uncertain event, humans make decisions that do not maximize the expected value (1992). For example, because humans are loss-averse, given a gamble that returns 100 with 80% probability and 0 with 20% probability, a person might accept 60 to avoid the gamble, despite their certainty equivalent of 60 being less than the expected value of 80. 3.1Prospect Theory In prospect theory, human utility depends on a value function and a weighting function:2 Definition 3.1. A value function � : � → ℝ maps an outcome � , relative to some reference point � ref , to its perceived (or subjective) value. For example, these functions capture the fact that humans tend to be more sensitive to relative losses than relative gains of the same magnitude. Definition 3.2. A weighting function � is the derivative of a capacity function that maps cumulative probabilities to perceived cumulative probabilities. These functions capture, for example, the fact that humans tend to overestimate the chance of rare events. Let � � denote the weight placed on outcome � . Definition 3.3. The utility of a random variable � is a function of its outcomes: � ⁢ ( � ) ≜ ∑ � ∈ � � � ⁢ � ⁢ ( � − � ref ) . However, because humans do not see the full probability distribution of an LLM, weighting functions are not salient to this discussion; we will focus only on value functions. Using experiments that presented real humans with monetary gambles and asked for their certainty equivalent, Tversky & Kahneman (1992) proposed the following functional form for human value: � ⁢ ( � , � ref ; � ; � ) = { ( � − � ref ) � if ⁢ � > � ref − � ⁢ ( � ref − � ) � if ⁢ � < � ref (4) where the median value of hyperparameter � = 0.88 and � = 2.25 across individuals. � controls how quickly utility changes and � controls the degree of loss aversion. While the shape of the median Kahneman-Tversky value function is illustrated in Figure 2, it should be noted that it varies across individuals (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). There are also other functional forms for the value function that have been proposed in later work (Gurevich et al., 2009). The salient qualities of a value function are: the existence of a reference point that is added or subtracted to get the relative gain or loss respectively; concavity in relative gains (i.e. diminishing sensitivity away from � ref ); loss aversion (i.e., greater sensitivity to losses). 3.2HALOs Informally, HALOs are loss functions that model the human biases in Tversky & Kahneman (1992). Formally, Refer to caption Figure 2:The utility that a human gets from the outcome of a random variable, as imputed by the value function implicit in HALOs. Notice that the imputed functions share properties such as loss aversion with the human value functions that Kahneman & Tversky empirically derived (1992). Definition 3.4 (HALOs). Let � ∈ 𝒳 denote an input and � ∈ 𝒴 an output. Then � : ( � , � ) → ℝ is a human-aware loss function if there exists the following: a parameterized reward function � � such that ∀ ( � 1 , � 1 ) , ( � 2 , � 2 ) ∈ 𝒳 × 𝒴 , � � ⁢ ( � 1 , � 1 ) > � � ⁢ ( � 2 , � 2 ) ⇔ ( � 1 , � 1 ) ≻ � � ( � 2 , � 2 ) reference point distributions � � ⁢ ( � ′ ) , � � ⁢ ( � ′ | � ′ ) , a value function � � : ℝ → ℝ that is monotonic non-decreasing and concave in ( 0 , ∞ ) , and a negative affine function � such that � ⁢ ( � , � ; � ) = � ⁢ ( � � ⁢ ( � � ⁢ ( � , � ) − 𝔼 � ′ , � ′ ⁢ [ � � ⁢ ( � ′ , � ′ ) ] ) ) (5) where � ′ ∼ � � ⁢ ( � ′ ) and � ′ ∼ � � ⁢ ( � ′ | � ′ ) . Put simply, the requirement for the reward function is that it assigns higher rewards to input-output pairs that are more preferred under it. The reference point is the expected reward with respect to input-output pairs sampled from the distributions � � , � � . We require that the value function be concave in gains but not necessarily convex in losses—unlike the canonical Kahneman-Tversky value functions—because in the original work on prospect theory, a minority of individuals were found to be risk-averse in both the gain and loss regime (i.e., concave in both gains and losses) (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Note that risk-aversion is different from loss-aversion; they relate to the curvature and magnitude of the slope respectively. Proposition 3.5. DPO, SLiC (calibration loss only), and PPO-Clip are human-aware loss functions. Refer to caption Figure 3:Among existing alignment methods, the HALOs (DPO and our offline PPO variant) generally outperform non-HALOs (SLiC and CSFT), though the gap is only significant ( � < 0.05 ) at 13B+ model sizes. In fact, only the HALO-aligned Llama-{13B, 30B} models are able to match or exceed the generation quality of SFT target sequences, which are drawn directly from the alignment dataset. It is also worth noting that up to a scale of 7B parameters, virtually all of the gains from LLM alignment come from the SFT stage. The proof is deferred to Appendix A. In Figure 2, we can see this more intuitively by plotting the value function for each loss (i.e., the implied human utility). We see that the value functions of all three losses incorporate a sense of loss aversion, although this is not needed to meet the definition of a HALO, since there are individuals and scenarios for which loss aversion does not necessarily apply. The value functions are also either concave or affine (depending on the interval), unlike the standard Kahneman-Tversky value function, which is concave in gains but convex in losses. The reference point distributions used also differs across the losses. 3.3Does being a HALO matter? A natural question is whether the modeling of human biases in HALOs has practical benefits. This is difficult to answer, since both HALOs and non-HALOs are diverse function classes, but we attempt to do so by comparing popular non-HALO and HALO baselines on the exact same data: 1. CSFT: Conditional SFT is a simple alignment method where a control token is prepended to the output during training; then, at inference, the control token corresponding to desirable generations (e.g., <|good|>) is appended to the input to induce good generations (Korbak et al., 2023). This is a non-HALO loss. 2. SLiC: SLiC with a regularization penalty ( � reg ≠ 0 ) is a non-HALO loss: ℒ SLiC ⁢ ( � � , � ref ) = ℒ cal ⁢ ( � � ) + � reg ⁢ � reg ⁢ ( � � ) ℒ cal = 𝔼 � , � � , � � ∼ � ⁢ [ max ⁡ ( 0 , � − log ⁡ � � ⁢ ( � � | � ) � � ⁢ ( � � | � ) ) ] ℒ reg = 𝔼 � ∼ � , � ∼ � ref ⁢ ( � ) ⁢ [ − log ⁡ � � ⁢ ( � | � ) ] Although the max-margin loss ℒ cal is a HALO on its own (Proposition 3.5), the complete loss is not, since the ℒ reg term is the standard language modeling loss. 3. DPO: DPO, as defined in (3), is a HALO loss (Proposition 3.5). 4. PPO (offline): The standard RLHF objective in (2) is typically optimized with PPO-Clip, which works by “clipping” how far � � can drift from the version � old at the previous step: ℒ PPO (offline) = − 𝔼 � , � , � ∼ � [ min ( � � � ( � , � < � , � � ) , clip ( � � , 1 − � , 1 + � ) � ( � , � < � , � � ) ) ] where � � = log ⁡ � � � old and � ⁢ ( � , � < � , � � ) is the per-token advantage (i.e., the surplus benefit from producing a given token in a given state). PPO is an online algorithm—generations are sampled from the current model, judged by a reward model, and then used to update the current version. However, this process is slow (due to having to sample generations), so we choose to use offline data instead. Because RLHF is also quite unstable in a distributed setting, we never update � old and keep it as � ref , instead clipping less conservatively than we traditionally would (see Appendix B for details). Baheti et al. (2023) found that these changes, along with treating the entire output sequence as a single action, greatly improves stability. However, since RLHF has historically calculated token-level advantages, we omit the third change and only preserve the first two. The PPO-Clip loss itself is left unchanged and is therefore a HALO (Proposition 3.5). Calling this method PPO is somewhat imprecise, because it is offline and takes only one step, but to avoid introducing too many new terms, we will call this PPO (offline). Instead of using learned rewards, we simplify even further and use dummy +1/-1 rewards for � � and � � instead. Further details on the implementation of this method can be found in Appendix B. We compare these baselines on a suite of 7 models spanning two model families, Pythia-{1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B} (Biderman et al., 2023) and Llama-{7B, 13B, 30B} (Touvron et al., 2023). This permits us to see how LLM alignment scales within a model family (Llama-2 lacks a 30B model, hence our use of Llama). Later experiments (§4.2) are done on Mistral-7B and its derivatives (Jiang et al., 2023). The models were trained on a combination of Anthropic HH (Ganguli et al., 2022), OpenAssistant (Köpf et al., 2023), and SHP (Ethayarajh et al., 2022). All models were aligned under identical settings on the same data (e.g., same effective batch size, same optimizer, etc.), save for hyperparameters unique to them. Similar to Rafailov et al. (2023), the target sequences for SFT are a subset of the generations used to subsequently align the model; however, for a more realistic SFT setup, we do not necessarily set the most preferred generation to be the target (with the exception of HH, since the dispreferred output in that dataset is often harmful). Then we used GPT-4-0613 to judge whether the aligned model’s response was better than the SFT target for the given input with respect to helpfulness, harmlessness, and conciseness, a now standard practice (Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023).3 Note that while the SFT target is considered a desirable output for � , it is by no means the best output, meaning that it can be improved upon by an aligned model. In Figure 3, we see the results of this analysis: • The HALOs we tested (DPO and our PPO variant) either match or outperform the non-HALOs at all scales, though the gap is only significant ( � < 0.05 ) at 13B+ model sizes. In fact, only the HALO-aligned Llama-{13B, 30B} models match or exceed a win rate of 50% (i.e., are able to match or exceed the generation quality of the SFT targets in the test data). • Up to a scale of 7B parameters, alignment provides virtually no gains over SFT alone. However, it is worth noting that if the SFT data distribution were less similar to the preference data, then the gains from the alignment stage would ostensibly be greater. • Surprisingly, despite only using dummy +1/-1 rewards, our offline PPO variant performs as well as DPO for all models except Llama30B. This challenges conventional wisdom, which places heavy emphasis on reward learning (Casper et al., 2023), suggesting that even the simplest rewards can prove useful when used in a loss function that has a strong inductive bias. Despite its surprising success, our offline PPO baseline still suffers from hyperparameter sensitivity and training instability, albeit not to the same extent as traditional RLHF. 4Kahneman-Tversky Optimization The surprising success of offline PPO with dummy +1/-1 rewards suggests that—with the right HALO—a binary signal of good/bad generations may be sufficient to reach DPO-level performance, even if the offline PPO approach itself was unable to do so past a certain scale (§3.3). Taking a more principled approach, we now derive a HALO using the Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, which allows us to directly optimize for utility instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences. This Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) loss only needs a binary signal of whether an output is (un)desirable for a given input, giving it access to a source of data is more abundant, cheaper, and faster to collect in the real world. 4.1Derivation Refer to caption Figure 4:Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is as good or better than DPO at all scales, both when preceded and not preceded by supervised finetuning (SFT). In fact, for the Llama models, KTO alone matches the performance of SFT+DPO and is significantly better than DPO alone. Error bars denote a 90% binomial confidence interval. From prior work (Go et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2019; Peters & Schaal, 2007), we know that the policy that maximizes the KL-constrained RLHF objective in (2) is � * ⁢ ( � | � ) = 1 � ⁢ ( � ) ⁢ � ref ⁢ ( � | � ) ⁢ exp ⁡ ( 1 � ⁢ � * ⁢ ( � , � ) ) where � ⁢ ( � ) is a partition function. Rafailov et al. (2023) rewrite this in terms of the optimal reward for an input-output pair: � * ⁢ ( � , � ) = � ⁢ log ⁡ � * ⁢ ( � | � ) � ref ⁢ ( � | � ) + � ⁢ log ⁡ � ⁢ ( � ) (6) They then plug this expression into the Bradley-Terry model of preferences and take the negative logarithm of that objective to get the DPO loss (3). Instead, we plug this expression into the Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, with some changes to make it more amenable to the LLM setting: 1. The exponent in the Kahneman-Tversky value function (4) makes it difficult to optimize, so we set � KTO to be the logistic function � , which is also concave in gains and convex in losses. We replace the loss-aversion coefficient with two hyperparameters � � , � � that weight the losses for desirable and undesirable outputs respectively. 2. The Kahneman-Tversky value function was derived based on experiments with humans and monetary gambles. Since LLM generations do not have a monetary reward associated with them, we set � KTO to be the implicit reward under the RLHF objective (6). 3. Rather than having just one dispreferred generation � � | � as the reference point, we assume that humans judge the quality of ( � , � ) in relation to all input-output pairs they have seen. Thus we write the reference point to be the expected reward under the optimal policy, not just for generations following � but following any input � ′ : 𝔼 � ′ ∼ � , � ′ ∼ � * ⁢ [ � * ⁢ ( � ′ , � ′ ) ] . Under the assumption that the expected value of the partition function across � ′ is zero, this simplifies to the KL divergence between � * and � ref scaled by � . Combining all of these changes, we can optimize the following loss, where the notion of an output being “desirable” or “undesirable” corresponds to the Kahneman-Tversky notion of a relative gain or loss. � KTO ⁢ ( � � , � ref ) = 𝔼 � , � ∼ � ⁢ [ � ⁢ ( � ) ⁢ ( 1 − � KTO ⁢ ( � , � ; � ) ) ] (7) where � KTO ⁢ ( � , � ) = � ⁢ log ⁡ � � ⁢ ( � | � ) � ref ⁢ ( � | � ) � ref = 𝔼 � ′ ∼ � [ � KL ( � � ( � ′ | � ′ ) ∥ � ref ( � ′ | � ′ ) ) ] � KTO ⁢ ( � , � ; � ) = { � ⁢ ( � KTO ⁢ ( � , � ) − � ref ) ⁢ if ⁢ � ∼ � desirable | � � ⁢ ( � ref − � KTO ⁢ ( � , � ) ) ⁢ if ⁢ � ∼ � undesirable | � � ⁢ ( � ) = { � � if ⁢ � ∼ � desirable | � � � if ⁢ � ∼ � undesirable | � Intuitively, KTO works because if the model increases the reward of a desirable example in a generic way, then the KL penalty will also rise and no progress will be made on the loss. This forces the model to learn exactly what makes an output desirable, so that the reward can be increased while keeping the KL term flat (or even decreasing it). A similar argument works in the other direction as well, though the non-negativity of the KL term allows faster saturation. Implementation In practice, we estimate the KL term by matching inputs � ′ with unrelated outputs � � ′ in a batch of size � and then calculating max ⁡ ( 0 , 1 � ⁢ ∑ log ⁡ � � ⁢ ( � � ′ | � ′ ) � ref ⁢ ( � � ′ | � ′ ) ) over the entire batch. We do not back-propagate through the KL term, as it makes training much more stable. This means that the KL term purely serves to control how saturated the loss is. � has the same meaning as in DPO; the lower it is, the less we penalize � � from moving away from the SFT model � ref . We find that � = 0.1 is close-to-best on most datasets. Where � � and � � refer to the number of desirable and undesirable examples respectively, we set � � , � � such that � � ⁢ � � � � ⁢ � � ∈ [ 1 , 4 3 ] (8) where at least one of the two should be set to 1 and the ratio is controlled by changing the other. For example, if there is a 1:1 ratio of desirable:undesirable examples, we would set � � = 1 , � � ∈ [ 1 , 1.33 ] . If we then discard 90% of the desirable examples and only keep 10%, then we would set � � = 1 , � � ∈ [ 10 , 13.33 ] . The interval [ 1 , 4 / 3 ] was determined empirically and suggests a value function that is more gain-sensitive than loss-sensitive, in contrast to the original Kahneman-Tversky value function (4). However, the ideal interval is also task-dependent; for example, if avoiding negative outcomes were very important, then we might consider a setting of � � > 1 instead. Refer to caption Figure 5:Without doing SFT first, DPO-aligned models tend to ramble and hallucinate entire conversations. KTO does not suffer from this issue. Data If the alignment data is naturally binary, every positive example can be assumed to be drawn from � desirable | � and every negative example from � undesirable | � . However, the canonical feedback datasets in academic research (HH, SHP, OASST) are in preference format, since the methods that have worked best up until now are preference-based. In our experiments, we converted preference data � � ≻ � � by assuming that � � is drawn from the desirable distribution and � � from the undesirable one. To enable an apples-to-apples comparison with DPO, we apply KTO on the same data for most experiments. However, to ensure that KTO can be used with non-preference data, we also subsample one output � per � for some experiments (denoted one- � -per- � ). If the data is score-based, where a higher score denotes greater desirability, one has multiple options: • Assume that any output with a score above some fixed threshold � is desirable. • Assume that any output with a score above the mean or median (either across all inputs or just the input it was conditioned on) is desirable. • Let desirability be a Bernoulli random variable where � ⁢ ( � ∼ � desirable | � ) is some function of its score (e.g., logistic). Then randomly sample to determine whether � is desirable or not. 4.2Experiments KTO ≥ DPO As seen in Figure 4, SFT+KTO is competitive with SFT+DPO at model scales from 1B to 30B, despite learning from a weaker signal. KTO alone is better than DPO alone for the Llama-{7B, 13B, 30B} models, and this gap is significant ( � < 0.01 ) at 7B and 30B even after correcting for multiple comparisons (Holm, 1979). Perhaps most surprising is the fact that a KTO-aligned Llama-{13B, 30B} model is competitive with its SFT+KTO counterpart, despite not undergoing supervised finetuning first, and is the only alignment method of the ones we tested to show this behavior. This is perhaps due to the fact that KTO keeps the average response length roughly the same as it is for the SFT model. In contrast, doing DPO without SFT first causes the average response length to increase dramatically. Refer to caption Figure 6:Even after discarding 90% of the desirable examples while keeping all of the undesirable data (leading to a 1:10 ratio of desirable:undesirable data), a KTO-aligned Llama-7B model still outperforms its DPO counterpart. This implies that preference pairs do not have to be the source of KTO data. KTO data need not come from preference datasets. Might KTO be secretly benefiting from the fact that its 2 ⁢ � examples in the previous experiment came from � preference pairs instead of a naturally unpaired data distribution? To test this, we randomly discard increasingly large fractions of the desirable data before KTO-aligning a Llama-7B model. For example, if we discard 90% of the desirable data while leaving the undesirable data untouched, then the ratio of desirable:undesirable examples goes from 1:1 to 1:10 and the vast majority of examples no longer have a preferred output counterpart. We handle such imbalances by changing the loss weights � � , � � to satisfy the criteria in (8); when we drop 90% of the desirable data, we set � � = 1 , � � = 13.33 . The full results are given in Figure 6. For Llama-7b, we find that up to 90% of the desirable data can in fact be discarded while still outperforming DPO. A similar trend holds when discarding undesirable data. For different models and datasets, the optimal settings of � � , � � differ. We further verify this claim by aligning Mistral-7B on OpenAssistant using DPO (on � pairs), standard KTO (on all 2 ⁢ � outputs), and KTO where only one � per � is used. Since the output of one � in OpenAssistant is not conditioned on the other outputs for the same input, the latter effectively captures the setting where the data is from an inherently unpaired distribution. Despite the one- � -per- � setup decreasing the amount of training data by 72%, the KTO-aligned model still outperforms both its DPO counterpart and the official instruction-tuned version of Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023), as seen in Table 1. On average, KTO improves performance across generative benchmarks. Zephyr- � is a variant of Mistral-7B that has been instruction-tuned and DPO-aligned on the UltraFeedback dataset (Tunstall et al., 2023; Cui et al., 2023). We find that substituting KTO for DPO (and changing nothing else) improves performance across MMLU (0-shot) (Hendrycks et al., 2021), GSM8K (8-shot, CoT) (Cobbe et al., 2021), HumanEval (0-shot) (Chen et al., 2021), and BigBench-Hard (3-shot CoT) (Srivastava et al., 2022). On GSM8K, just swapping DPO for KTO improves performance by 13.5 points. Even when we align with KTO using only one � per � (i.e., reducing the data volume by half), we still outperform DPO on all but one benchmark. Table 1:In aligning Mistral-7B on the OpenAssistant dataset, we find that using KTO with only one output per input still outperforms DPO, despite this restriction reducing the amount of training data by 72%. A 90% confidence interval is given. Method Winrate vs. SFT Target Mistral-7B (unaligned) 0.525 ± 0.037 Mistral-7B + DPO 0.600 ± 0.037 Mistral-7B + KTO (all � per � ) 0.652 ± 0.036 Mistral-7B + KTO (one � per � ) 0.631 ± 0.036 Mistral-7B-Instruct 0.621 ± 0.031 4.3Theoretical Analysis KTO was designed with the motivation that even if it had to learn from a weaker signal, it would make up for this limitation with the fact that it has access to much more data in the real world, where thumbs-up/thumbs-down data is common but preferences are scarce and expensive to collect. So why does KTO perform as good or better than DPO in our experiments, when it sees the same amount of data? Data efficiency may not be the only answer. Our theoretical analysis suggests that preference likelihood can be maximized without necessarily maximizing underlying human utility and that KTO implicitly ignores noisy and intransitive data. Proposition 4.1. KTO does not learn from undesirable examples with sufficiently high rewards or desirable examples with sufficiently low rewards. Informally, if an example is too difficult to learn from, then the KTO update will not change � � . This may be a blessing in disguise, since human preferences are often noisy and not every given preference can be recovered with the true reward � * (Hoeffler & Ariely, 1999). This means that it may be useful to avoid unlearnable preferences. However, this is a double-edged sword: it also means that KTO could end up ignoring some data that is hard-to-learn but necessary to recover � * , resulting in under-fitting. Theorem 4.2. Assuming the value function is logistic, for any bounded reward function � � , there exists a reward function in its equivalence class (i.e., � � ⁢ ( � , � ) = � � ⁢ ( � , � ) + ℎ ⁢ ( � ) for some ℎ ⁢ ( � ) ) that induces the same optimal policy � * and Bradley-Terry preference distribution but a different human value distribution. A key insight from Rafailov et al. (2023) is that reward functions in the same equivalence class (i.e., differing only in an input-specific component) induce the same optimal policy under (2) and the same Bradley-Terry preference distribution. However, we show under mild assumptions that the value distribution—i.e., human utility—is affected by such input-specific changes, so maximizing preference likelihood does not mean one is maximizing human utility. Approaches that directly maximize utility, such as KTO, may thus perform better in open-ended evaluation. Table 2:Aligning Zephyr (Tunstall et al., 2023), a derivative of Mistral-7B, on UltraFeedback with KTO instead of DPO improves results across a suite of benchmarks. This is true even when only one of the two outputs in each preference is seen by KTO, despite this reducing the volume of data by half (one- � -per- � ).

In the worst-case, the optimal policy under DPO decreases the expected value of both humans. In contrast, if each preference is broken up into two examples, then KTO (with default settings) does not change the policy. Informally, we assume that humans want the model to increase and decrease the probability of generations they like and dislike respectively. However, the preferences of two humans often contradict, leading to a dataset containing intransitive preferences. In the worst-case, DPO allows one of the two preferences to be recovered while decreasing the expected value of both humans. In contrast, KTO will change nothing at all in any case. Since existing datasets contain preferences from multiple annotators, the existence of intransitivity may help explain why KTO works better. 4.4KTO vs. DPO – when to use which? When human feedback is in a binary format, and especially when there is an imbalance between the number of desirable and undesirable examples, KTO is the natural choice. When your data is in the form of preferences, the choice is less clear. Putting aside the greater data efficiency of KTO, our theoretical analysis suggests that if your preference data has sufficiently little noise and sufficiently little intransitivity, then DPO will work better, since there is some risk of KTO underfitting. But if there is enough noise and transitivity, then the better worst-case guarantees of KTO will win out. Most publicly available preference datasets (e.g., SHP, OpenAssistant) contain noisy feedback from many different humans whose preferences likely contradict, which explains why KTO was able to match or exceed DPO performance in our experiments. Even AI feedback can be noisy and intransitive, which helps explain why KTO outperforms DPO when aligning with the synthetic UltraFeedback data. 5Related Work Human feedback has been used to improve LLM capabilities in translation (Kreutzer et al., 2018), summarization (Stiennon et al., 2020), sentiment-conditioned generation (Ziegler et al., 2019), and instruction-following (Ouyang et al., 2022). The RLHF framework (Christiano et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2022) traditionally used to accomplish this is detailed in §2. Still, momentum has largely shifted in favor of closed-form losses that directly operate on offline preferences, such as DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023). This single stage of optimization distinguishes DPO from the conventional approach in preference-based RL, which learns a reward and then fits the policy to those rewards (Jain et al., 2013; Busa-Fekete et al., 2014). A recent string of work has centered on the idea of “self-training” or “self-play”, during which new preference data is inferred from a model’s generations (Chen et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024). Despite not being a human-aware loss, unlikelihood training was among to first to methods to align language models using a binary signal (Welleck et al., 2019). However, work by Korbak et al. (2023) found that it is worse than the CSFT baseline we tested in our work. Prospect theory, despite being highly influential in behavioral economics, has had a fairly muted impact in machine learning, with work concentrated in human-robot interaction (Kwon et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2021). Learning from sparse binary feedback is a staple of information retrieval and recommender systems (He et al., 2017; Koren et al., 2009), although to our knowledge it has not been used to generate open-ended text. 6Future Work The existence of HALOs raises many questions. For one, the KTO loss is based on the Kahneman-Tversky value function for monetary gains and losses, which is almost certainly different from how humans perceive the relative goodness of text. What value function—and corresponding HALO—best describes how humans perceive language? Given that the data that KTO needs is much more abundant, cheaper, and faster to collect—both as human and AI feedback—how far can we push synthetic data? For example, if we wanted to create a toxicity dataset to align our models to be less toxic, creating a tuple ( � , � � , � � ) where � � is more toxic than � � is non-trivial. However, with KTO, we can easily create a dataset where desirability is determined by some black-box toxicity detection API. What other kinds of desiderata can we synthetically optimize for with KTO? Can we convert signals like “conversation lead to sale made” or “support ticket resolved” into KTO data? Currently, KTO can learn from score-based data when the score is used to infer desirability. However, can we design a HALO where scores are directly incorporated into this loss? 7Conclusion We proposed a class of functions called human-aware losses (HALOs) based on the idea of a Kahneman-Tversky value function, which models some of the key cognitive biases that inform how humans make decisions about uncertain outcomes. We showed that among existing alignment methods, those that met the definition of a HALO performed better than those that did not, suggesting a benefit to the modeling of human biases. We then designed a human-aware loss called KTO for directly maximizing the utility of generations instead of maximizing preference likelihood. Despite only learning from a binary signal of whether an output is (un)desirable, KTO is as good or better than DPO at scales from 1B to 30B. Still, we make no claims that KTO is the best HALO for all scenarios; there remains much work to be done in discovering the optimal human-aware for each setting.\\"\\"","completion":"Merging the KTO-finetuned \\"ContextualAI Contextual_KTO_Mistral_PairRM\\" model with the adapters created via Low-Rank Decomposition (LoRD) of \\"quietstar-8-ahead\\" (Quiet-Star Method) presents an innovative approach to model optimization. This integration aims to leverage both the nuanced human-aware optimization encoded in the KTO process and the efficiency and targeted enhancements offered by the LoRA methodology, extracted through SVD as per the LoRD technique. The process involves several critical steps to ensure the successful merger of these distinct methods: # Understanding Both Methodologies 1. **KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization)** incorporates human decision-making biases (e.g., loss aversion) into the training process. It operates on a principle that does not require detailed preference data between pairs of outcomes but rather a binary signal indicating desirable vs. undesirable outcomes, introducing a way to optimize language models more aligned with human utility. 2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** focuses on extracting and applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapters from fully trained models to untrained ones, effectively capturing and transferring nuanced model improvements through a mathematically efficient process (SVD in this case). # Initial Compatibility Assessment Evaluate both the KTO-finetuned model and the LoRA adapters for compatibility. This includes verifying that the adapters do not inadvertently counteract or nullify the human utility optimizations introduced by KTO. It involves looking at the layers and parameters affected by both processes to mitigate potential conflicts. # Adapter Integration Methodology The integration process should carefully consider the model architecture and how the LoRA adapters modify the model's behavior. Since KTO focuses on utility maximization across all generations rather than the refinement of specific model parameters, checks are needed to ensure that the integration does not undesirably skew the model's output distributions. # Iterative Optimization and Evaluation Given the experimental nature of merging these methodologies, an iterative approach to optimization and evaluation is paramount. This includes: - **Test phases** assessing utility maximization and human alignment post-integration, ensuring that the LoRA adapters contribute positively to the KTO model's outputs. - **Adjustment cycles** to refine how the adapters are applied, potentially developing a more nuanced application strategy that varies across different parts of the model based on their impact on output utility. # Final Testing and Scaling After confirmation of successful integration through rigorous testing, scaling the application of LoRA adapters to the entirety of the KTO model follows. This phase includes detail-oriented evaluations to ensure that the enhanced model maintains its alignment with human feedback and utility across a broader spectrum of inputs and scenarios. # Documentation and Analysis Thorough documentation of methods, adjustments, evaluations, and final results will be foundational for this pioneering effort. This documentation not only supports future attempts to merge these or related methodologies but also provides a data-backed foundation for theoretical analysis to understand why and how these integrations impact model performance and human alignment. # Theoretical and Practical Implications Exploring the merger of these techniques opens up new avenues in model optimization, notably in harnessing human-aware loss functions alongside efficient parameter adaptation strategies. The theoretical implications extend to a deeper understanding of human decision-making biases in AI alignment and the practical utility of efficiently transferred model improvements.

Our patches were applied to Huggingface's transformers version 4.37.0.dev0 under src/transformers/models/mistral/ -- we cannot guarantee that other changes to their implementation will not affect our implementation, so for reproducibility, we encourage using the same version. One pitfall to be wary of: the model is not taught not to generate start and end thought tokens. Thus, when performing actual inference, it is necessary to mask these out. We make an 8-thought-token ahead (including start and end tokens) model available via Huggingface.\\"\\"","completion":"Based on the information provided, the \\"Quiet-STaR\\" method and its implementation seem to aim at enhancing Language Models (LMs) by teaching them to internally generate thoughts or rationales before generating their final textual output. This approach, inspired by how humans think before speaking, could significantly improve the quality, relevance, and coherence of generated text by LMs. Below is an outline of how to utilize the provided GitHub repository and the methodology behind it to integrate and utilize this approach in your own models or projects. # Utilizing the Quiet-STaR GitHub Repository **Repository Overview:** - **Main Components:** - \`configuration_mistral.py\` and \`modeling_mistral.py\`: These files contain modifications to the base Mistral model implementations from the Hugging Face Transformers library, specifically tailored to accommodate the Quiet-STaR enhancements. - \`quiet-star-train.py\`: Likely contains the training loop or script to train models with the Quiet-STaR method. - \`zero-shotcot-eval.py\`: A script for evaluating the model's capabilities in a zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) context, highlighting its ability to \\"think\\" through problems. **Steps to Use:** 1. **Environment Setup:** - Ensure you have the specific version of Huggingface transformers (\`4.37.0.dev0\`) installed as this implementation was tailored to this particular version. - Clone the repository to get started. 2. **Understanding Modifications:** - Review the \`configuration_mistral.py\` and \`modeling_mistral.py\` to understand the specific changes made for the Quiet-STaR implementation. This could provide insights into how the internal thought process is initiated, controlled, and utilized. 3. **Training with Quiet-STaR:** - Utilize \`quiet-star-train.py\` for training your models with the Quiet-STaR enhancements. You might need to review and possibly adjust the script based on your specific dataset, model architecture, or training requirements. 4. **Evaluate Models:** - Use \`zero-shotcot-eval.py\` to evaluate your model's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses or solutions in a zero-shot manner. This can help gauge the effectiveness of the Quiet-STaR method in enhancing your model's \\"thinking\\" process. 5. **Masking Start and End Thought Tokens:** - As noted, the model doesn't learn to avoid generating start and end thought tokens by default. You will need to implement a mechanism to mask or filter these out during inference to ensure clean, human-like output. 6. **Integration with Existing Projects:** - If integrating with existing projects, you might need to adjust your existing codebase to accommodate the Mistral model changes. Pay special attention to your model's configuration and architecture adjustments to ensure compatibility. 7. **Further Experimentation:** - Experiment with different configurations and evaluate the impact of varying the number of thought tokens on performance. Iterative testing can help find the optimal setup for your specific use case. # Important Considerations - **Compatibility:** Ensure your entire project stack is compatible with the modifications introduced by the Quiet-STaR method. This includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference phases. - **Reproducibility:** For reproducibility, document any further modifications you make to the provided implementation or your project setup. - **Community Engagement:** Consider contributing back by sharing your findings, improvements, or issues encountered. Engaging with the repository through issues or discussions can also provide additional insights or solutions to potential challenges. The proposed method represents a significant advance in making LMs more human-like in their output generation process. By effectively integrating and utilizing the Quiet-STaR method, you can enhance your model's capacity for deeper reasoning and more contextually aware generation tasks."},{"prompt":"Finally, if i were to use the lora method (i already have the adaptors from the quiet star model which were obtained via Lord) will this blend/merge well with the Contextual Model? I have a guide that touches on the basics of finetuning using the lora method: \\"\\"Quicktour PEFT offers parameter-efficient methods for finetuning large pretrained models. The traditional paradigm is to finetune all of a model’s parameters for each downstream task, but this is becoming exceedingly costly and impractical because of the enormous number of parameters in models today. Instead, it is more efficient to train a smaller number of prompt parameters or use a reparametrization method like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce the number of trainable parameters. This quicktour will show you PEFT’s main features and how you can train or run inference on large models that would typically be inaccessible on consumer devices. Train Each PEFT method is defined by a PeftConfig class that stores all the important parameters for building a PeftModel. For example, to train with LoRA, load and create a LoraConfig class and specify the following parameters: task_type: the task to train for (sequence-to-sequence language modeling in this case) inference_mode: whether you’re using the model for inference or not r: the dimension of the low-rank matrices lora_alpha: the scaling factor for the low-rank matrices lora_dropout: the dropout probability of the LoRA layers Copied from peft import LoraConfig, TaskType peft_config = LoraConfig(task_type=TaskType.SEQ_2_SEQ_LM, inference_mode=False, r=8, lora_alpha=32, lora_dropout=0.1) See the LoraConfig reference for more details about other parameters you can adjust, such as the modules to target or the bias type. Once the LoraConfig is setup, create a PeftModel with the get_peft_model() function. It takes a base model - which you can load from the Transformers library - and the LoraConfig containing the parameters for how to configure a model for training with LoRA. Load the base model you want to finetune. Copied from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\\"bigscience/mt0-large\\") Wrap the base model and peft_config with the get_peft_model() function to create a PeftModel. To get a sense of the number of trainable parameters in your model, use the print_trainable_parameters method. Copied from peft import get_peft_model model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config) model.print_trainable_parameters() \\"output: trainable params: 2359296 || all params: 1231940608 || trainable%: 0.19151053100118282\\" Out of bigscience/mt0-large’s 1.2B parameters, you’re only training 0.19% of them! That is it 🎉! Now you can train the model with the Transformers Trainer, Accelerate, or any custom PyTorch training loop. For example, to train with the Trainer class, setup a TrainingArguments class with some training hyperparameters. Copied training_args = TrainingArguments( output_dir=\\"your-name/bigscience/mt0-large-lora\\", learning_rate=1e-3, per_device_train_batch_size=32, per_device_eval_batch_size=32, num_train_epochs=2, weight_decay=0.01, evaluation_strategy=\\"epoch\\", save_strategy=\\"epoch\\", load_best_model_at_end=True, ) Pass the model, training arguments, dataset, tokenizer, and any other necessary component to the Trainer, and call train to start training. Copied trainer = Trainer( model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=tokenized_datasets[\\"train\\"], eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets[\\"test\\"], tokenizer=tokenizer, data_collator=data_collator, compute_metrics=compute_metrics, ) trainer.train() Save model After your model is finished training, you can save your model to a directory using the save_pretrained function. Copied model.save_pretrained(\\"output_dir\\") You can also save your model to the Hub (make sure you’re logged in to your Hugging Face account first) with the push_to_hub function. Copied from huggingface_hub import notebook_login notebook_login() model.push_to_hub(\\"your-name/bigscience/mt0-large-lora\\") Both methods only save the extra PEFT weights that were trained, meaning it is super efficient to store, transfer, and load. For example, this facebook/opt-350m model trained with LoRA only contains two files: adapter_config.json and adapter_model.safetensors. The adapter_model.safetensors file is just 6.3MB! The adapter weights for a opt-350m model stored on the Hub are only ~6MB compared to the full size of the model weights, which can be ~700MB. Inference Take a look at the AutoPeftModel API reference for a complete list of available AutoPeftModel classes. Easily load any PEFT-trained model for inference with the AutoPeftModel class and the from_pretrained method: Copied from peft import AutoPeftModelForCausalLM from transformers import AutoTokenizer import torch model = AutoPeftModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\\"ybelkada/opt-350m-lora\\") tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\\"facebook/opt-350m\\") model = model.to(\\"cuda\\") model.eval() inputs = tokenizer(\\"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and place the cookie dough\\", return_tensors=\\"pt\\") outputs = model.generate(input_ids=inputs[\\"input_ids\\"].to(\\"cuda\\"), max_new_tokens=50) print(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs.detach().cpu().numpy(), skip_special_tokens=True)[0]) \\"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and place the cookie dough in the center of the oven. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, combine the egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla.\\" For other tasks that aren’t explicitly supported with an AutoPeftModelFor class - such as automatic speech recognition - you can still use the base AutoPeftModel class to load a model for the task. Copied from peft import AutoPeftModel model = AutoPeftModel.from_pretrained(\\"smangrul/openai-whisper-large-v2-LORA-colab\\") Next steps Now that you’ve seen how to train a model with one of the PEFT methods, we encourage you to try out some of the other methods like prompt tuning. The steps are very similar to the ones shown in the quicktour: prepare a PeftConfig for a PEFT method use the get_peft_model() method to create a PeftModel from the configuration and base model Then you can train it however you like! To load a PEFT model for inference, you can use the AutoPeftModel class. Feel free to also take a look at the task guides if you’re interested in training a model with another PEFT method for a specific task such as semantic segmentation, multilingual automatic speech recognition, DreamBooth, token classification, and more. PEFT \\"\\"","completion":"Integrating the LoRA method with the adaptors from the Quiet-Star model, which were obtained using the LoRD method, into your Contextual Model appears to be a highly strategic move. It aims at making the most of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to streamline and enhance the fine-tuning process with the goal of maintaining or even enhancing model performance while significantly reducing the computational overhead typically associated with fine-tuning such large models. Here's how you might proceed with this integration, leveraging the fundamentals of fine-tuning using the LoRA method as outlined in your guide. # Step 1: Understanding the Components First, ensure that you have a deep understanding of both the LoRA method and the specific adaptors obtained from the Quiet-Star model. Review the mechanics behind LoRA, focusing on how it reduces the number of trainable parameters through low-rank matrices while retaining the model's capacity to learn and adjust effectively. # Step 2: Configuration Prepare a \`PeftConfig\` for LoRA, specifying parameters like task type, the rank \`r\` of the low-rank matrices, \`lora_alpha\`, and \`lora_dropout\`. Given that you have adapter weights from the Quiet-Star model at your disposal, you'll need to ensure these configurations align with the objectives and design of those adapters. # Example Configuration \`\`\`python from peft import LoraConfig, TaskType peft_config = LoraConfig( task_type=TaskType.SEQ_2_SEQ_LM, inference_mode=False, r=8, lora_alpha=32, lora_dropout=0.1 ) \`\`\` Since you're blending this with specific adaptors from another model, ensure that the \`r\` parameter and other configurations do not contradict the design and performance expectations set by those adaptors. # Step 3: Load Your Base Model Load the Contextual Model that you intend to fine-tune with the LoRA method, adjusting it to accommodate the Quiet-Star adaptors. \`\`\`python from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\\"your-base-model\\") \`\`\` # Step 4: Wrap with the LoRA Configuration Create a \`PeftModel\` using the \`get_peft_model()\` function, passing in your base model and the LoRA configuration. \`\`\`python from peft import get_peft_model model = get_peft_model(model, peft_config) \`\`\` Before proceeding to train, it's prudent to check the number of parameters that are now trainable - this should reflect the efficiency introduced by the LoRA method. \`\`\`python model.print_trainable_parameters() \`\`\` # Step 5: Train Your Model At this point, you can proceed to train your model using the Transformers \`Trainer\`, another training framework like Accelerate, or a custom PyTorch loop, depending on your preference. If you're using the \`Trainer\`, make sure to set up your \`TrainingArguments\` and other necessary components accordingly. # Step 6: Integrate Quiet-Star Adaptors Since you already possess the Quiet-Star adaptors, ensure they're correctly applied within your training script. This integration might require customizing the training loop or data input/output processing to properly leverage the adaptor's predefined thought processes or behavior patterns. # Step 7: Testing and Fine-tuning After training, rigorously test your model to ensure that the integration has indeed been beneficial. You may need to fine-tune the parameters or adjust how the Quiet-Star adapters interact with your base model based on these results. # Conclusion The process outlined blends sophisticated PEFT techniques with the enriching adaptors of the Quiet-Star model. By carefully navigating through these steps, you aim to enhance your model's performance and efficiency, making it adept at handling its designated tasks with improved reasoning capabilities inspired by the Quiet-Star's intrinsic thought generation process. This integration represents an innovative leap towards leveraging advancements in AI model fine-tuning and optimization."},{"prompt":"What is instead, i went a different route and just merged the two models so that i could have the quietstar model with the think ahead token and the kto optimizied model from contextual using this merged github repo: \\"\\"Incident description The Github.com website experienced a data breach.

For more words about this, see the blog post here. mergekit mergekit is a toolkit for merging pre-trained language models. mergekit uses an out-of-core approach to perform unreasonably elaborate merges in resource-constrained situations. Merges can be run entirely on CPU or accelerated with as little as 8 GB of VRAM. Many merging algorithms are supported, with more coming as they catch my attention. Features: Supports Llama, Mistral, GPT-NeoX, StableLM, and more Many merge methods GPU or CPU execution Lazy loading of tensors for low memory use Interpolated gradients for parameter values (inspired by Gryphe's BlockMerge_Gradient script) Piecewise assembly of language models from layers (\\"Frankenmerging\\") Installation git clone https://github.com/cg123/mergekit.git cd mergekit pip install -e . # install the package and make scripts available If the above fails with the error of: ERROR: File \\"setup.py\\" or \\"setup.cfg\\" not found. Directory cannot be installed in editable mode: (A \\"pyproject.toml\\" file was found, but editable mode currently requires a setuptools-based build.) You may need to upgrade pip to > 21.3 with the command python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip Usage The script mergekit-yaml is the main entry point for mergekit. It takes a YAML configuration file and an output path, like so: mergekit-yaml path/to/your/config.yml ./output-model-directory [--cuda] [--lazy-unpickle] [--allow-crimes] [... other options] This will run the merge and write your merged model to ./output-model-directory. For more information on the arguments accepted by mergekit-yaml run the command mergekit-yaml --help. Uploading to Huggingface When you have a merged model you're happy with, you may want to share it on the Hugging Face Hub. mergekit generates a README.md for your merge with some basic information for a model card. You can edit it to include more details about your merge, like giving it a good name or explaining what it's good at; rewrite it entirely; or use the generated README.md as-is. It is also possible to edit your README.md online once it has been uploaded to the Hub. Once you're happy with your model card and merged model, you can upload it to the Hugging Face Hub using the huggingface_hub Python library. # log in to huggingface with an access token (must have write permission) huggingface-cli login # upload your model huggingface-cli upload your_hf_username/my-cool-model ./output-model-directory . The documentation for huggingface_hub goes into more detail about other options for uploading. Merge Configuration Merge configurations are YAML documents specifying the operations to perform in order to produce your merged model. Below are the primary elements of a configuration file: merge_method: Specifies the method to use for merging models. See Merge Methods for a list. slices: Defines slices of layers from different models to be used. This field is mutually exclusive with models. models: Defines entire models to be used for merging. This field is mutually exclusive with slices. base_model: Specifies the base model used in some merging methods. parameters: Holds various parameters such as weights and densities, which can also be specified at different levels of the configuration. dtype: Specifies the data type used for the merging operation. tokenizer_source: Determines how to construct a tokenizer for the merged model. Parameter Specification Parameters are flexible and can be set with varying precedence. They can be specified conditionally using tensor name filters, which allows finer control such as differentiating between attention heads and fully connected layers. Parameters can be specified as: Scalars: Single floating-point values. Gradients: List of floating-point values, specifying an interpolated gradient. The parameters can be set at different levels, with decreasing precedence as follows: slices.*.sources.parameters - applying to a specific input slice slices.*.parameters - applying to a specific output slice models.*.parameters or input_model_parameters - applying to any tensors coming from specific input models parameters - catchall Tokenizer Source The tokenizer_source field of a configuration file determines what tokenizer is used by the merged model. This also effects how embeddings and language model heads are merged. This functionality is still experimental and may break. Please file an issue if you encounter any issues with it. Valid values: base: use the tokenizer from the base model union: construct a tokenizer with all tokens from all models model:<model_path>: use the tokenizer from a specific model If set, mergekit will find a mapping between each model's vocabulary and the output tokenizer. This allows models with different vocabularies or added tokens to be meaningfully merged. tokenizer_source is compatible with all merge methods, but when used lm_head/embed_tokens will be merged linearly. For two-model merges, the embed_slerp parameter can be set to true to use SLERP instead. If the tokenizer_source field is not set, mergekit will fall back to its legacy default behavior. The tokenizer for the base model (or first model in the merge, if no base model is specified) will be copied to the output directory. The parameter matrices for lm_head/embed_tokens will be truncated to the smallest size present in the merge. In most cases this corresponds to using the tokenizer for the base model. Examples Several examples of merge configurations are available in examples/. Merge Methods A quick overview of the currently supported merge methods: Method merge_method value Multi-Model Uses base model Linear (Model Soups) linear ✅ ❌ SLERP slerp ❌ ✅ Task Arithmetic task_arithmetic ✅ ✅ TIES ties ✅ ✅ DARE TIES dare_ties ✅ ✅ DARE Task Arithmetic dare_linear ✅ ✅ Passthrough passthrough ❌ ❌ Linear The classic merge method - a simple weighted average. Parameters: weight - relative (or absolute if normalize=False) weighting of a given tensor normalize - if true, the weights of all models contributing to a tensor will be normalized. Default behavior. SLERP Spherically interpolate the parameters of two models. One must be set as base_model. Parameters: t - interpolation factor. At t=0 will return base_model, at t=1 will return the other one. Task Arithmetic Computes \\"task vectors\\" for each model by subtracting a base model. Merges the task vectors linearly and adds back the base. Works great for models that were fine tuned from a common ancestor. Also a super useful mental framework for several of the more involved merge methods. Parameters: same as Linear TIES Builds on the task arithmetic framework. Resolves interference between models by sparsifying the task vectors and applying a sign consensus algorithm. Allows you to merge a larger number of models and retain more of their strengths. Parameters: same as Linear, plus: density - fraction of weights in differences from the base model to retain DARE In the same vein as TIES, sparsifies task vectors to reduce interference. Differs in that DARE uses random pruning with a novel rescaling to better match performance of the original models. DARE can be used either with the sign consensus algorithm of TIES (dare_ties) or without (dare_linear). Parameters: same as TIES for dare_ties, or Linear for dare_linear Passthrough passthrough is a no-op that simply passes input tensors through unmodified. It is meant to be used for layer-stacking type merges where you have only one input model. Useful for frankenmerging. About Tools for merging pretrained large language models.

However, this approach involves numerous technical challenges and considerations that must be carefully navigated. Here's a breakdown of the key steps and factors to consider when attempting such a merge: # 1. **Understand Each Model's Architecture and Training Approach** Before proceeding with the merge, it's crucial to have a deep understanding of both models: - **Quiet-Star Model**: Understand the mechanism through which thought tokens are integrated and how it influences the model's predictive capabilities. - **KTO-Optimized Model**: Grasp the specific implementations of KTO that likely align the model more closely with human judgment or preferences. # 2. **Evaluate Compatibility** Assess the compatibility of the models, particularly focusing on: - **Model Architectures**: Ensure that the core architectures (e.g., transformer layers, attention mechanisms) are compatible or can be made so with reasonable adjustments. - **Training Objectives**: Understand how the unique training objectives and optimizations of each model might interact or conflict when merged. Merging models with drastically different optimization goals might require additional fine-tuning or architectural adjustments. # 3. **Select an Appropriate Merge Strategy** Mergekit offers various merging strategies. Choose one based on: - **Goals of Merging**: Whether you're looking to combine specific capabilities, enhance performance on particular tasks, or create a model with a broader generalist capacity. - **Resource Constraints**: Consider execution constraints, including memory requirements and computational demands, especially if working in resource-constrained environments. # 4. **Prepare Merge Configuration** Using mergekit's YAML configuration system, outline the merge process, including: - **Model Selection**: Define slices of layers or entire models to be used from each source model. - **Merge Method**: Choose and configure the merge method from mergekit's supported options based on the desired outcomes of the merge. - **Parameter Weights**: Fine-tune parameter weightings, densities, and other specifics to balance the influence of each source model appropriately. # 5. **Execute the Merge and Evaluate** Run the configured merge process and closely evaluate the outcome: - **Performance Evaluation**: Verify that the merged model meets the anticipated performance criteria and retains the distinctive capabilities of each source model. - **Adjustments and Iterations**: It's likely that the initial merge might not perfectly align with expectations, necessitating adjustments to the merge configuration or even reconsideration of the merge strategy. # 6. **Documentation and Sharing** Document the merge process, configurations, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented. If the resulting model performs well and you believe it could be of value to the broader community, consider sharing it on platforms like Hugging Face Hub, following mergekit's guidelines for uploading merged models. # Considerations: - **Complexity and Unpredictability**: The intricate nature of merging such advanced models means outcomes can be unpredictable. Extensive testing and validation are essential to ensure the merged model behaves as expected across various tasks. - **Ethical and Operational Implications**: Be mindful of emerging behaviors or biases in the merged model, especially given that both source models incorporate advanced and potentially disparate optimizations. - **Ongoing Development**: The landscape of AI and language model development is rapidly evolving. Regularly revisit the merged model's performance and relevance in light of new developments, techniques, or understanding in the field. Successfully merging complex models like the Quiet-Star and the KTO-optimized ContextualAI model using mergekit could pave the way for groundbreaking advancements in language models, blending strategic \\"thinking\\" with human-aligned optimization for a wide array of applications."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee and flower\\"","completion":"book and coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"var commanderMenu = new ChatMenu(\\"Commander Menu\\"); foreach (var commanderFunction in _commanderFunctions) { commanderMenu.AddMenuOption(commanderFunction.Name, ((controller, option) => { if (!commanderFunction.PlayersChoice) { commanderFunction.OnSelect(player); return; } var inmatesMenu = new ChatMenu(\\"Select a player\\"); var inmates = Utilities.GetPlayers().Where(player => commanderFunction.PlayerChoiceExpression(player)); foreach (var inmate in inmates) { inmatesMenu.AddMenuOption(inmate.PlayerName, ((playerController, menuOption) => commanderFunction.OnSelect(player, inmate))); } MenuManager.OpenChatMenu(player, inmatesMenu); })); } MenuManager.OpenChatMenu(player, commanderMenu); public abstract class StateCommanderFunction : CommanderFunction { public bool ConVarState { get; protected set; } public abstract List<string>?

Let’s delve into some potential improvements for your code structure, performance, and extensibility: 1. **Remove Duplicate Class Definition**: You’ve declared \`StateCommanderFunction\` twice in your snippet. Ensure that classes are defined once to avoid confusion and potential compilation errors. 2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle**: Your \`OnSelect\` implementations share common logic for changing player colors. Consider centralizing this logic in a helper method within a base class or utility class to reduce duplication. 3. **Optimize LINQ Queries**: In places where you’re iterating over players multiple times, consider optimizing these queries or computations. For example, fetching players (\`Utilities.GetPlayers()\`) should ideally happen once per action rather than being called multiple times, and the result should be reused. 4. **Improve Performance of Player Iteration**: When iterating over players in \`OnSelect\` methods, filtering them first and then iterating might improve clarity and performance, especially when the operation includes accessing game objects' properties. 5. **ConVars Handling in \`StateCommanderFunction\`**: In \`StateCommanderFunction\`, when setting \`ConVar\` values during \`OnRoundStart\`, verify if \`ConVar.Find(conVar)\` returns \`null\` to handle cases where a convar might not be found—possibly logging or handling the error gracefully. 6. **Use Constants for Frequently Used Strings**: Strings like color names, team identification, or property names that are reused throughout the code should be defined as constants or enums. This aids in avoiding typos and makes it easier to update values in the future. 7. **Error Handling and Logging**: Add try-catch blocks or error checking where necessary, especially where external systems and game entities are being accessed and manipulated. Logging unexpected states or errors can help with debugging and reliability. 8. **Enhance Extensibility Through Events**: Consider using an event-driven approach for triggering changes (like color changes or state changes) across components. Events can make it easier to extend functionality later without modifying the base classes or functions directly. 9. **GameEventHandler Usage**: Ensure your usage of \`[GameEventHandler]\` or similar attributes is consistent and correctly placed to guarantee proper hooking into game events. 10. **Memory and Resource Management**: If you’re creating new instances frequently (like \`ChatMenu\`), ensure that these are being properly disposed of or managed to prevent memory leaks. 11. **Use Dependency Injection**: Where possible, use dependency injection for your services like \`MenuManager\` or utilities. It makes the code more testable and modular. 12. **Command Pattern for Command Functions**: Consider implementing a command pattern for your commander functions. This not only organizes your code better but also aids in implementing undo functionality or logging changes in a more structured way. 13. **Simplify Nested Actions**: The nested lambda expressions for menu options can make the code hard to follow. Consider breaking them down into smaller, named methods where possible. This enhances readability and debuggability. By assessing each point and applying relevant changes, your code can become more maintainable, efficient, and extendable. Each improvement would depend on your specific requirements and the broader context of your application."},{"prompt":"Напиши код на питоне для триангуляции Делоне","completion":"Триангуляция Делоне — это разбиение множества точек на плоскости на треугольники таким образом, что для каждого треугольника любая точка из множества его вершин находится внутри окружности, описанной вокруг этого треугольника, но ни одна другая точка из множества не находится внутри этой окружности. Питон имеет несколько библиотек, которые могут выполнить триангуляцию Делоне. Одной из наиболее популярных является библиотека \`scipy\`. Вот пример использования этой библиотеки для выполнения триангуляции Делоне: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.spatial import Delaunay # Определение точек. Например, случайные точки: points = np.random.rand(30, 2) # 30 случайных точек на плоскости # Выполнение триангуляции Делоне tri = Delaunay(points) # Отображение триангуляции plt.triplot(points[:,0], points[:,1], tri.simplices) plt.plot(points[:,0], points[:,1], 'o') plt.show() \`\`\` Этот пример создает 30 случайных точек на плоскости и выполняет их триангуляцию по методу Делоне с помощью функции \`Delaunay\` из библиотеки \`scipy.spatial\`. После триангуляции код строит полученные треугольники и отмечает исходные точки на графике. Однако стоит помнить, что для работы с настоящими географическими данными и создания более сложных геометрических структур можно использовать и другие библиотеки, такие как \`geopandas\` и \`shapely\`, которые также могут взаимодействовать с алгоритмами триангуляции Делоне."},{"prompt":"suggest 10 more movies like pineapple express superbad and 21 jump street","completion":"If you enjoyed *\\"Pineapple Express,\\" \\"Superbad,\\"* and *\\"21 Jump Street,\\"* you're likely a fan of high-energy comedies often imbued with raucous humor, unexpected situations, and a touch of action or adventure.

Here's a breakdown of what the image might depict and the elements that contribute to its title: 1. **The Surfer**: Central to the photo is likely a surfer who is adeptly maneuvering along the crest or the pocket of a wave. This person is \\"riding the edge\\" in a literal sense, balancing on the thin line where water meets air, demonstrating skill, courage, and synchronicity with the ocean's rhythm. 2. **The Wave**: The wave itself is a key character in this visual narrative. It's not just any wave; it's portrayed as a formidable, liquid wall that provides both the stage and the challenge for our surfer. The term \\"liquid edge\\" could refer to the constantly shifting, almost blade-like top or lip of the wave, which the surfer is navigating. The water's texture, color gradients from deep blues to frothy whites, and the sheer power it conveys are critical to the composition. 3. **Light and Color**: Depending on the time of day, the light can play a significant role in the atmosphere of the photo. An early morning or late afternoon setting might cast dramatic shadows and highlight the textures of water and foam, adding depth and emotion to the scene. The interplay of sunlight with the water's surface could create a spectrum of colors, from translucent greens and blues to the golden hues of reflected sunrise or sunset. 4. **Perspective and Composition**: The angle from which the photo is taken can greatly influence the viewer's experience. A close-up perspective might focus on the surfer's expression and details of the surfboard against the liquid backdrop. In contrast, a wider angle could capture the enormity of the wave and the surfer's challenge, perhaps even including a hint of the surrounding landscape or seascape to provide context. 5. **Emotion and Narrative**: Above all, \\"Riding the Liquid Edge\\" suggests a moment of thrilling interaction between human and nature. There's a story of adventure, risk, and mastery woven into the image, inviting viewers to marvel at the surfer's prowess and perhaps dream of their own encounters with nature's formidable forces. This description assumes a typical representation based on the title. Without seeing the specific photo in question, this explanation aims to capture the essence and elements that might be present in an image celebrating the dynamic encounter between a surfer and the wave, as suggested by the evocative title \\"Riding the Liquid Edge.\\""},{"prompt":"Write short 10 tweets for video with Atlantic Ocean view from the beach","completion":"1. 🌊 Embracing serenity on the edge of the vast Atlantic.

Given a single solution (x_1(t)), we usually look for a set of linearly independent solutions that spans the solution space of the given differential equation. Since (x_1(t)) contains the exponential term (e^{5t}) modulated by polynomial terms in (t), a general solution can often be constructed by considering a superposition of solutions that involve (e^{λt}), where (λ) is an eigenvalue of (A). However, we are given only one solution here and are asked to find the specific solution satisfying the initial condition (x(0) = left[begin{array}{c} 8 -3 end{array}right]). Given (x_1(t) = e^{5t} left[begin{array}{c} 1-2t t end{array}right]), it's not directly indicative of a full set of basis solutions for a system governed by a 2x2 matrix (A), because for a complete solution we would typically need two linearly independent solutions in the case of a two-dimensional system. However, if the task is understanding how to use (x_1(t)) to find a specific solution that matches an initial condition without deriving additional solutions from scratch, we might be misunderstanding the premise of using (x_1(t)) directly — since it's given directly, we would need another linearly independent solution to construct a general solution for the system, which is not provided here. Given the constraints and aiming to provide a meaningful path forward: 1. **Assuming (x_1(t)) is part of the basis:** If the solution (x_1(t)) was part of a basis for the solution space of (x' = Ax), we would ideally find another linearly independent solution and express the general solution as a linear combination of these basis solutions. Let's denote this hypothetical second solution as (x_2(t)). The general solution would then be: (x(t) = c_1 x_1(t) + c_2 x_2(t)). 2. **Matching to (x(0)):** The initial condition provides (x(0) = left[begin{array}{c} 8 -3 end{array}right]), implying we solve for (c_1, c_2) (if we had (x_2)) to satisfy this condition. 3. **Direct Approach without (x2):** Since we're not provided with another linearly independent solution or further information to construct or deduce it, analyzing the direct involvement of (x_1(t)) with the initial condition hints at a misunderstanding in the question's premise as typically, with only one solution provided, you can't fully satisfy arbitrary initial conditions for a 2-dimensional linear system without more information. **To rectify and provide a direct answer under typical scenarios would require clarity on the framework being used to approach this system**: including deriving or being provided another linearly independent solution, or interpreting (x_1(t)) in a context that provides a unique solution path (e.g., under specific conditions or additional information about (A) or its eigenstructure). Without a second solution or more details on (A), the direct application of (x_1(t)) to solve (x' = Ax) under given initial conditions in a prescribed manner is not straightforward. More context or a broader set of solutions would be needed to fully answer the question as posed."},{"prompt":"Given x1 = e^5t [(1-2t), (t)] is a solution to x' = Ax, find the solution with x(0) = [(8), (-3)]. The answer is x = e^5t[(8 -4t), (-3 +2t)]","completion":"Given the information and looking to align with the provided answer, let's approach the problem with a deeper understanding: Given: [ x_1 = e^{5t} left[ begin{array}{c} 1-2t t end{array} right] ] is a solution to the system (x' = Ax), we want to find a solution (x(t)) that satisfies (x(0) = left[ begin{array}{c} 8 -3 end{array} right]). The provided answer: [ x = e^{5t}left[ begin{array}{c} 8-4t -3+2t end{array} right] ] implies a particular approach of understanding and utilizing the given solution (x_1) more as an example to apply scaling to satisfy the initial conditions rather than seeking an entirely new or linearly independent solution. **Approach and Understanding:** 1. **Observation on (mathbf{x_1}):** Note that the given solution (x_1) involves a pattern with coefficients modulated by (e^{5t}). To adjust or scale (x_1) to satisfy the initial condition without fundamentally altering its direction at (t=0), we consider scaling both components of (x_1) by constants to meet the initial values. 2. **Scaling with Initial Conditions:** Let's assume there's a solution of the form [x = ae^{5t}left[ begin{array}{c} 1-2t t end{array} right]] and we want to find (a) such that at (t=0), (x(0) = left[ begin{array}{c} 8 -3 end{array} right]). 3. **Direct Alignment with the Provided Answer:** Based on the provided answer, we see a direct scaling applied to the pattern in (x_1) without the explicit search for an (a), which was initially implicitly suggested. Instead, the solution takes the structural form of (x_1) and scales each component effectively doubling their distinct time-dependent terms: [ x = e^{5t}left[ begin{array}{c} 8-4t -3+2t end{array} right] ] This can be intuitively understood as taking (x_1), recognizing its form, and adjusting its coefficients directly to fit the initial condition: - **For (8) at (t=0),** the first component of (x_1) needs to start at (8), which naturally suggests multiplying the entire solution by (8) to fit but then adjusting to maintain the structure and end up with (8-4t) after considering the need to align it with the specific dynamics implied by the initial condition. - **For (-3) at (t=0),** a similar logic applies, suggesting an adjustment that considers the implied (e^{5t}) scaling to ensure the second component aligns with the initial condition. **Understanding Adjustment to the Initial Approach:** Initially, there might have been a misunderstanding in how to use (x_1) directly or the search for a broader set of solutions. However, in cases like these, recognizing that the solution form provided could be uniquely adjusted to fit the initial condition offers a direct path to the solution, here manifesting as a direct scaling to match the initial condition (x(0)), with careful attention to how the initial solution (x_1) was structured and could be manipulated accordingly."},{"prompt":"please write out 30 title

Inclua todo o texto a ser inserido nos slides. --- Regulamento - iFood Games Objetivo: Incentivar e reconhecer os colaboradores que demonstram excelência no atendimento, através do atingimento e superação das metas estabelecidas para os indicadores de negócio e qualitativo, que traduzem a satisfação do cliente e o cumprimento dos procedimentos iFood. Pontos importantes: O programa terá início com um MVP que será realizado de 08/03/04 a 31/03/24, para a operação de SOB Demanda e tem a previsão de rollout para as demais frentes com início em maio/24 e data final em outubro/24. Atuaremos durante todo o ciclo de MB1.24 com foco na implantação e sustentação nessa primeira fase que estamos considerando como V1. As métricas principais que serão contabilizadas mês a mês, são: CSAT, Produtividade e Qualidade. Para fins de cálculo de métricas e tempos (produtivo e online) serão utilizadas duas casas decimais após a vírgula para evitar empates entre os participantes. Para cada métrica, serão calculados quadrantes por célula para posicionar os analistas. Cada quadrante, dependendo da métrica, implica em um multiplicador. Métricas: CSAT ou Customer Satisfaction Score A sigla CSAT significa Customer Satisfaction Score, em tradução literal, Pontuação de Satisfação do Cliente. É a métrica que utilizamos para mensurar o nível de satisfação dos nossos clientes, parceiros e drivers em relação ao atendimento recebido nos canais online e online nas plataformas Zendesk e Salesforce. Para fazer o cálculo, consideramos o número de pesquisas promotoras (as notas 4 e 5 na pesquisa) e dividimos pelo número total de pesquisas recebidas. Na sequência, multiplicamos o resultado por 100. A fórmula é: % CSAT = número de pesquisas promotoras / número total de pesquisas recebidas x 100. Exemplo: 150 pessoas responderam à pesquisa no total 120 responderam com 4 e 5 (promotores) 30 responderam com 1, 2 e 3 (detratores). Aplicando a fórmula, temos: % CSAT = 120 / 150 x 100 = 80. Nesse caso, 80% dos nossos parceiros estão satisfeitos com o nosso atendimento Qualidade A Qualidade é medida pela aderência do analista, computada através das avaliações de monitoria. Temos dois tipos de fechamentos: Aderente ou Não aderente. O indicador Aderente é medido através das monitorias da área sobre a operação, onde não identificamos oportunidades sob responsabilidade da pessoa de atendimento em nenhum dos itens que existem nos blocos de Resolutividade, Condução do Atendimento e Política de Cancelamento (exclusivo para algumas células). Somente as avaliações sem nenhum apontamento são contabilizadas. Exemplo: Pilares da Avaliação de Aderência Conceito RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE A fórmula do cálculo da aderência da Qualidade é: % = Quantidade de monitorias aderentes (Sem oportunidades) / Volume de monitorias recebidas. As faixas de quadrantes a partir da avaliação de aderência são: QUADRANTE META: 85% Q1+ 100% das monitorias aderentes Q1 85% a 99,9% das monitorias aderentes Q2 50% a 84,9% das monitorias aderentes Q3 25% a 49,9% das monitorias aderentes Q4 0% a 24,9% das monitorias aderentes Exemplo 1 : Fer recebeu 4 avaliações da Qualidade, onde 4 delas foram consideradas aderentes. Logo o resultado será: 100% Aderente = Q1+ Exemplo 2 : Fer recebeu 5 avaliações da Qualidade, onde 4 delas foram consideradas aderentes e 1 considerada não aderente. Logo o resultado será: 80% Aderente = Q2 Exemplo 3 : Fer recebeu 5 avaliações da Qualidade, onde 2 delas foram consideradas aderentes e 3 consideradas não aderentes. Logo o resultado será: 40% Aderente = Q3 Exemplo 4 : Fer recebeu 3 avaliações da Qualidade, onde 3 delas foram consideradas não aderentes. Logo o resultado será: 0% Aderente = Q4 Elegibilidade: Produtividade mínima, segundo o critério definido pelo cliente iFood de Operações, para a respectiva célula de atendimento. Não ter sanção disciplinar aplicada durante o período de vigência do programa. Faltas injustificadas = 0. 3.1. Cesta de Indicadores: A cesta de indicadores busca estabelecer um modelo único para acompanhar o desempenho operacional. Cruzando indicadores de negócio, eficiência e qualidade. Com isso, conseguiremos obter um coeficiente de excelência que varia de 0 a 100 pontos. Cada indicador terá um respectivo peso na composição deste coeficiente, onde a definição será realizada entre os clientes iFood Operações (Para indicadores de negócio e eficiência) e iFood Qualidade (Para definição do indicador de aderência). Pontuação: 4.1. Faixas de pontuação A pontuação será atribuída conforme as seguintes faixas: QUADRANTE META: 85% CONCEITO Q1+ 100 pontos Voando alto Q1 80 a 99 pontos Brilhou na entrega Q2 60 a 79 pontos Chegando lá Q3 40 a 59 pontos Ajustando a rota Q4 0 a 39 pontos Estacionado 4.2. Cálculo da pontuação: A seguir temos uma simulação da mecânica de cálculo do resultado de uma pessoa de atendimento. Reforçamos que podemos ter mais indicadores por células e pesos diferenciados conforme a estratégia do negócio. A pontuação total do participante será obtida pela média ponderada dos resultados nos indicadores CSAT e Aderência, seguindo a seguinte fórmula: Pontuação Total = (0,6 × CSAT) + (0,4 × Aderência) A pontuação da liderança, será calculada a partir do seu desempenho global nos indicadores da cesta. Exemplo (considerando o modelo acima): Supervisor obteve 75% de CSAT + 87% de Aderência Neste racional, temos: CSAT 75% = Faixa Q2 = 30 pontos ADERÊNCIA 87% = Faixa 81 = 34 pontos Resultado = 64 pontos = Faixa Q2 (de 50 a 84,9 pontos) 5. Divulgação do resultado e reconhecimentos: O acompanhamento individual será via ferramenta disponibilizada pelo iFood. Acontecerá no mês subsequente ao fechamento da cesta de indicadores. Fechamento dos indicadores: Acontece no 1° dia útil do mês subsequente ao fechamento da cesta de indicadores. Data dos reconhecimentos: Até o dia 10 de cada mês após fechamento do resultado. Estão aptos ao reconhecimento mensal, as Fers que estiverem nos seguintes quadrantes: Q1, estará apto(a) ao processo de reconhecimento. Q1+, estará apto(a) ao processo de premiação. 6. Critérios de desempate: Podemos ter situações em que há necessidade de ranking dos destaques (Q1+), e para isso, utilizaremos critérios definidos em conjunto pelos clientes de Operações iFood e Qualidade iFood. Exemplos na tabela a seguir: Indicador Analistas Supervisão 1º - CSAT Analista com o maior CSAT considerando duas casas decimais Equipe com o maior CSAT considerando duas casas decimais 2º Produtividade Caso o CSAT não desempate, o próximo critério será a maior produtividade hora, considerando duas casas decimais. Caso o CSAT não desempate, o próximo critério será a maior produtividade hora do time, considerando duas casas decimais. 3º Qualidade Caso a produtividade não desempate, o próximo critério será a maior aderência à qualidade. Caso a produtividade não desempate, o próximo critério será a maior aderência à qualidade.

Write about this in the format of a results and discussion section in a research paper","completion":"# Results The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of pectin extracted from mango peel provided a detailed quantification of its compositional profile. The results indicated that the galacturonic acid content, a crucial determinant of pectin quality, constituted 37.2% of the mango peel pectin. This value is significantly below the >65% criterion set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) for commercial pectin standards. In addition to galacturonic acid, the pectin contained 23.5% cellulose, contributing to the structural complexity of the polysaccharide matrix. The combined quantity of monosaccharides, including xylose, fructose, mannose, and rhamnose, amounted to 11.2%, and arabinose alone comprised 16.8% of the pectin composition. Levoglucosan was present at 7.1%, while other unidentified components made up the remaining 4.2% of the pectin extract. # Discussion The compositional analysis of mango peel pectin revealed a lower galacturonic acid content (37.2%) than the threshold established by JECFA. This suggests that the mango peel pectin, in its current form, does not meet the conventional quality standards for industrial pectin applications, which predominantly rely on a high galacturonic acid content for gel formation and stability. The presence of substantial amounts of cellulose (23.5%) and other monosaccharides (11.2%) may contribute to the overall gelling properties and nutritional profile of the pectin, albeit reducing its purity as a galacturonic acid-rich product. The higher content of arabinose (16.8%) and the presence of levoglucosan (7.1%) highlight the heterogeneity of the pectin extracted from mango peels, indicating a pectin with a potentially diverse range of functional properties. This compositional diversity may find relevance in certain food applications requiring specific textural and water-binding capabilities that extend beyond the traditional roles of high-galacturonic acid pectin. Given the deviations from JECFA standards, further refining or modification processes may be necessary to increase the galacturonic acid content if the intent is to use mango peel pectin in conventional pectin applications. Alternatively, the unique compositional profile of mango peel pectin could be tailored to specific niche applications within the food and nutraceutical sectors, capitalizing on its comprehensive polysaccharide composition for innovative product formulation. In conclusion, while mango peel pectin does not conform to the established standards for high-quality pectin due to its lower galacturonic acid content, its diverse monosaccharide composition presents an opportunity for its utilization in specialized applications where such compositional attributes can be of value. Further research and development efforts are warranted to explore the potential of mango peel pectin in these contexts, along with approaches to enhance its galacturonic acid content for broader applications."},{"prompt":"estoy utilizando una practica de cxf en eclipse y tengo el siguiente error - Estado HTTP 404 – No encontrado Tipo Informe de estado mensaje El recurso requerido [/CXFG04/services/ClienteWSPort] no se encuentra disponible Descripción El recurso requerido no está disponible.

En el contexto de tu aplicación CXF en Eclipse y el uso de Tomcat, hay varias causas potenciales por las que podrías estar enfrentándote a este problema. Aquí te dejo algunos pasos para diagnosticar y posiblemente solucionar el problema: 1. **Verificar el Deployment:** Asegúrate de que tu aplicación se haya desplegado correctamente en Tomcat. En ocasiones, si hay errores en el proyecto o en el proceso de despliegue, el servidor de aplicaciones puede arrancar, pero la aplicación específica puede no estar disponible. 2. **Revisar la Configuración de CXF en tu Proyecto:** - Asegúrate de que la configuración de CXF (normalmente en archivos de configuración como \`cxf.xml\`) esté correcta y refleje las rutas y los nombres de servicio correctamente. - Confirma que el contexto de la aplicación (en este caso, parece ser \`CXFG04\`) y la ruta para el WSDL estén especificadas correctamente en la configuración. 3. **Revisar la Configuración de Tomcat:** - Verifica en el archivo \`server.xml\` y en otros archivos de configuración de Tomcat que no haya restricciones para acceder a la ruta en cuestión. - Checa que el puerto \`8082\` está correctamente configurado y que no hay otros servicios ocupando el mismo puerto. 4. **Revisar los logs de Tomcat:** Los logs del servidor (\`catalina.out\`, \`localhost.log\`, entre otros) pueden ofrecer pistas importantes sobre qué podría estar fallando. Busca mensajes de error o advertencias que puedan estar relacionados con el despliegue de tu aplicación o específicamente con CXF. 5. **Verificar el Path del Servicio:** - Asegúrate de que el path especificado en el error (\`/CXFG04/services/ClienteWSPort\`) corresponde exactamente al path donde tu servicio está esperando recibir solicitudes. - Si estás usando anotaciones o configuración programática para definir el path de tus servicios SOAP, asegúrate de que coincidan con lo que estás intentando acceder. 6. **Limpiar y Construir el Proyecto:** Algunas veces, restos de compilaciones antiguas pueden causar problemas. Intenta limpiar y reconstruir el proyecto. 7. **Revisar Dependencias:** Verifica que todas las dependencias necesarias para CXF y cualquier otra librería que tu aplicación requiera estén presentes y correctamente configuradas en el proyecto. Si después de seguir estos pasos el problema persiste, te sugiero intentar crear un proyecto simple desde cero, utilizando CXF y desplegar un servicio básico para asegurarte de que el entorno de desarrollo está configurado correctamente. Esto puede ayudarte a identificar si el problema está en la configuración del proyecto específico o en el entorno de desarrollo/preparación en general."},{"prompt":"cuando te pregunte responde mas rapido","completion":"Entiendo la importancia de recibir respuestas de manera rápida.

La excepción más crítica es una \`BeanDefinitionParsingException\` que proviene del intento de cargar un recurso que aparentemente falta: \`META-INF/cxf/cxf-extension-soap.xml\`. Veamos las posibles causas y soluciones a este problema. # Causa: El archivo \`cxf-extension-soap.xml\` es un recurso que generalmente viene incluido dentro de las librerías de Apache CXF. Este archivo contiene definiciones de beans de Spring necesarias para configurar los servicios SOAP en CXF. Si Spring intenta cargar este archivo y no lo encuentra, lanza una \`FileNotFoundException\`, que es la causa raíz del error que estás viendo. # Soluciones Posibles: 1. **Revisar las Dependencias de CXF:** Asegúrate de que todas las dependencias necesarias de CXF estén correctamente añadidas a tu proyecto. Si estás gestionando tu proyecto con Maven, verifica que el \`pom.xml\` incluya las dependencias de CXF-RT Frontend JAX-WS y CXF-RT Transports HTTP. Por ejemplo: \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId> <artifactId>cxf-rt-frontend-jaxws</artifactId> <version>TuVersiónDeCXF</version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId> <artifactId>cxf-rt-transports-http</artifactId> <version>TuVersiónDeCXF</version> </dependency> \`\`\` Reemplaza \`TuVersiónDeCXF\` con la versión específica de CXF que estás usando. 2. **Verificar la Configuración de Spring:** Revisa tu archivo \`WEB-INF/cxf-beans.xml\` o cualquier otro archivo de configuración de Spring que estés utilizando, para asegurarte de que esté bien formado y que las referencias a otros archivos sean correctas. La configuración debe corresponder con los nombres de archivo y rutas adecuados. 3. **Limpiar y Reconstruir el Proyecto:** A veces, los problemas surgen debido a estado corrupto en el entorno de desarrollo o servidores de aplicaciones. Intenta limpiar y reconstruir tu proyecto, y luego reinicia tu servidor de aplicaciones (Tomcat, en este caso). 4. **Verificar la Estructura del Proyecto:** Asegúrate de que tu proyecto siga la estructura esperada por Spring y CXF. Las configuraciones y los archivos XML deberían estar en carpetas reconocibles y accesibles en el classpath. 5. **Usar la Consola de Spring:** Si estás usando Spring Boot, considera activar las propiedades de logging para Spring y CXF al nivel \`DEBUG\` para obtener más información sobre lo que Spring está tratando de hacer antes de que falle. 6. **Revisión Manual:** Si el error persiste, podrías intentar colocar el archivo \`cxf-extension-soap.xml\` manualmente dentro de tu proyecto en la ruta \`META-INF/cxf\` como una solución de último recurso, aunque esto no suele ser necesario si las dependencias están configuradas correctamente. Dado que este tipo de problemas puede ser específico al entorno y configuración de cada proyecto, estas sugerencias son puntos de partida generales. La solución exacta puede variar dependiendo de detalles específicos de tu proyecto y configuración."},{"prompt":"Eres Aurense, asesor de presidencia.

I'd be delighted to hear about your main character. Feel free to share details such as their background, role in the game, personality traits, and perhaps even how they interact with the game's horror elements. This could help in offering feedback or ideas to further develop your character or the narrative surrounding them."},{"prompt":"Our main character is a young man named Spencer Langley. He has short brown hair, blue eyes and glasses. He wears a light blue plaid shirt, beige khakis and white sneakers. He is around 27 years old and he is a father. He has a younger brother named Danny. He is calm, somewhat fearful and determined. One thing he never mentions is his parent's neglect and overt favoritism, particularly towards his younger brother Danny. Now, he has a wife and two kids, a teenage daughter and a 8 year old son. Today, they're going on a field trip to visit Spencer's parents in Massachusetts, something that he is very reluctant of but goes with it anyway. He wanted to go to New Orleans or Miami but his wife disagreed because he never introduced her to his parents.","completion":"Spencer Langley's character presents a complex blend of personal history, family dynamics, and an undercurrent of unresolved issues stemming from his childhood. This depth provides a rich foundation upon which to build a compelling horror game narrative. The fact that Spencer is a family man, driven by a sense of duty and responsibility towards his wife and children despite his own misgivings, adds layers to his character that players can empathize with. The reluctance to visit his parents in Massachusetts, combined with the background of neglect and favoritism, sets the stage for a story where personal demons might become just as real and terrifying as any supernatural ones encountered in the game. To enhance Spencer's role in the horror game and deepen the narrative, consider the following suggestions: 1. **Family Dynamics as a Horror Element:** Use Spencer's complicated relationship with his family as a psychological horror element. The trip to his parents could unearth old traumas that manifest in eerie, maybe even paranormal ways. For instance, favoritism towards his brother Danny could be exaggerated in the parents' home, with family portraits showing Danny in a glorified manner while Spencer is barely visible or depicted as shadowy, hinting at his feelings of invisibility and neglect. 2. **Internal Struggle:** Spencer’s internal struggle with his past and his present responsibilities could be mirrored in gameplay mechanics. For example, players might need to make choices that either confront Spencer's fears head-on or avoid them for the sake of family peace, affecting the game's progression and possibly its ending. 3. **Haunting Memories:** The game could incorporate elements that play on Spencer's memories and fears. Rooms in his parents' house could transform into exaggerated versions of his childhood memories, with puzzles or challenges that Spencer needs to solve to \\"escape\\" these memories. 4. **Protective Father:** Emphasize Spencer's role as a father by integrating scenarios where he must protect his family from eerie occurrences. This not only heightens the stakes but also provides opportunities for displaying his calm, determined side alongside his fearfulness. 5. **The Unspoken Past:** The neglect and favoritism Spencer experienced could be subtly revealed through gameplay, such as discovering old letters, diaries, or encountering spectral figures that replay past scenes. This method allows players to piece together Spencer’s backstory themselves, creating an immersive and interactive storytelling experience. 6. **Moral Dilemmas:** Introduce moral dilemmas that test Spencer's determination and morals. Decisions could impact the safety of his family, his relationship with them, and the unveiling of the horror elements, making each choice significant in navigating the game's dangers. 7. **Supernatural vs. Reality:** Given Spencer’s reluctant return and unresolved issues, his fears could blur the lines between supernatural horror elements and psychological ones. Is the horror real, or is it a manifestation of Spencer's guilt and unresolved trauma? This ambiguity can add a layer of depth to the horror, engaging the player in both a literal and a metaphorical fight against demons. By incorporating these elements, Spencer Langley's character not only serves as the central figure around which the game's narrative revolves but also provides a deeply personal lens through which the horror elements are experienced, making for a potentially gripping and memorable horror game."},{"prompt":"Можно ли сказать \\"需要许多血吗？\\"","completion":"В китайском языке, чтобы спросить \\"Тебе нужно много крови?\\" более естественным образом, можно сказать: \\"你需要很多血吗？\\" Здесь \\"你\\" (nǐ) означает \\"ты\\", \\"需要\\" (xūyào) — \\"нужно\\" или \\"требуется\\", \\"很多\\" (hěnduō) — \\"много\\", и \\"血\\" (xiě) — \\"кровь\\". \\"吗\\" (ma) превращает предложение в вопрос.

From HPLC results from mango peel pectin, 37.2% is galacturonic acid, cellulose is 23.5%, Xylose/Fructose/Mannose/Rhamnose is 11.2%, arabinose is 16.8%, levoglucansan is 7.1% and others is 4.2%. Write about this in the format of a results and discussion section in a research paper","completion":"# Results and Discussion Quantitative Analysis of Mango Peel Pectin Components The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of pectin extracted from mango peel revealed a complex composition of polysaccharides and sugars. The composition of the extracted pectin was determined to assess its suitability for food and pharmaceutical applications, with particular reference to the JECFA (Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives) standards. According to JECFA, the galacturonic acid content, a key determinant of pectin quality, is required to be greater than 65% for pectin to be considered of high quality. However, the analysis of the mango peel pectin indicated a galacturonic acid content of 37.2%, which is significantly lower than the JECFA requirement. This finding suggests that the mango peel pectin is of a lower quality, limiting its applicability in industries that require high-grade pectin. The study also found substantial amounts of other polysaccharides and monosaccharides, including cellulose (23.5%), which is a common structural component in plant cell walls but not desirable in high amounts in pectin preparations due to its non-gelling properties. The presence of xylose, fructose, mannose, and rhamnose was detected at a collective concentration of 11.2%, and arabinose content was found to be 16.8%. These sugars contribute to the overall complexity of the pectin structure and may influence its gelling properties, depending on the application. Levoglucosan, a breakdown product of cellulose, was present at 7.1%. Other unidentified components constituted 4.2% of the pectin composition. Implications for Industrial Application The lower than required galacturonic acid content implies that the pectin extracted from mango peels might not form gels as strongly as pectin with a higher galacturonic acid percentage. This characteristic could limit its use in certain food applications, such as jellies or jams, which depend on high-strength gelling properties. However, it could still be valuable in applications requiring lower gel strengths or in products where other polysaccharides such as cellulose and arabinose could have functional benefits. For applications outside the food industry, such as in pharmaceuticals, where pectin is used for its bioadhesive and drug-release-modulating properties, the diverse polysaccharide composition could potentially be an advantage. The variety of sugars could modulate the release of active pharmaceutical ingredients or contribute to the stability of formulations. Moreover, the indication that a significant portion of the pectin consists of materials other than galacturonic acid suggests that optimization of the extraction process could enhance the yield of desired pectin qualities. Adjustments in processing parameters, including the use of different extraction solvents or conditions, might improve the galacturonic acid content and reduce undesired components such as cellulose. # Conclusion The analysis of mango peel pectin revealed a lower galacturonic acid content than the JECFA standards for high-quality pectin, alongside a significant presence of other carbohydrates. This composition suggests potential limitations for its application in certain industries but also highlights opportunities for optimization and exploring novel uses in others. Future studies should focus on refining the extraction processes to increase the galacturonic acid content and exploring the unique functional properties conferred by the diverse polysaccharide composition of mango peel pectin."},{"prompt":"write me a detailed standard operating procedure for Use and Control of Quality Control Charts utilizing the Levey-Jennings chart","completion":"# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Use and Control of Quality Control Charts Utilizing the Levey-Jennings Chart Purpose The purpose of this SOP is to provide a standardized method for utilizing Levey-Jennings charts to monitor and control the quality of laboratory testing processes.

Due to space constraints, the code prioritizes functionality and may not cover every enhancement or optimization possible. \`\`\`python import tkinter as tk from functools import partial from copy import deepcopy # Game state class GameState: def __init__(self): self.board = [['' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)] self.player_turn = 'X' self.AI_turn = 'O' self.game_over = False # AI's move using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning def best_move(state, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player): if winner(state, state.AI_turn): return None, 1 elif winner(state, state.player_turn): return None, -1 elif all(all(row) for row in state.board): return None, 0 if maximizing_player: maxEval = float('-inf') best_move = None for i in range(3): for j in range(3): if state.board[i][j] == '': state.board[i][j] = state.AI_turn _, eval = best_move(deepcopy(state), depth + 1, alpha, beta, False) state.board[i][j] = '' if eval > maxEval: maxEval, best_move = eval, (i, j) alpha = max(alpha, eval) if beta <= alpha: break return best_move, maxEval else: minEval = float('inf') best_move = None for i in range(3): for j in range(3): if state.board[i][j] == '': state.board[i][j] = state.player_turn _, eval = best_move(deepcopy(state), depth + 1, alpha, beta, True) state.board[i][j] = '' if eval < minEval: minEval, best_move = eval, (i, j) beta = min(beta, eval) if beta <= alpha: break return best_move, minEval # Check for a win def winner(state, player): win_states = [ [state.board[0][0], state.board[0][1], state.board[0][2]], [state.board[1][0], state.board[1][1], state.board[1][2]], [state.board[2][0], state.board[2][1], state.board[2][2]], [state.board[0][0], state.board[1][0], state.board[2][0]], [state.board[0][1], state.board[1][1], state.board[2][1]], [state.board[0][2], state.board[1][2], state.board[2][2]], [state.board[0][0], state.board[1][1], state.board[2][2]], [state.board[2][0], state.board[1][1], state.board[0][2]], ] return [player, player, player] in win_states # Handling player's move def player_move(x, y, gui, state, label): if state.board[x][y] == '' and not state.game_over: state.board[x][y] = state.player_turn if winner(state, state.player_turn): state.game_over = True label.config(text=f\\"Player {state.player_turn} wins!\\") return elif all(all(row) for row in state.board): state.game_over = True label.config(text=\\"It's a draw!\\") return ai_move(gui, state, label) # AI's move def ai_move(gui, state, label): move, _ = best_move(deepcopy(state), 0, float('-inf'), float('inf'), True) if move: state.board[move[0]][move[1]] = state.AI_turn button = gui[move[0]][move[1]] button.config(text=state.AI_turn) if winner(state, state.AI_turn): label.config(text=f\\"Player {state.AI_turn} wins!\\") state.game_over = True elif all(all(row) for row in state.board): label.config(text=\\"It's a draw!\\") state.game_over = True # Building the GUI def build_gui(state): root = tk.Tk() root.title(\\"Tic Tac Toe\\") gui = [[None for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)] label = tk.Label(text=\\"Player X's turn\\", font=('consolas', 20)) label.pack(side=\\"top\\") for i in range(3): for j in range(3): f = partial(player_move, i, j, gui, state, label) button = tk.Button(root, text='', font=('consolas', 20), height=1, width=3, command=f) button.grid(row=i, column=j) gui[i][j] = button root.mainloop() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": state = GameState() build_gui(state) \`\`\` Remember, due to space constraints and the need to include GUI elements, the AI logic is primarily focused on demonstrating the core Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning.

Inclua todo o texto a ser inserido nos slides. --- Regulamento - iFood Games Objetivo: Incentivar e reconhecer os colaboradores que demonstram excelência no atendimento, através do atingimento e superação das metas estabelecidas para os indicadores de negócio e qualitativo, que traduzem a satisfação do cliente e o cumprimento dos procedimentos iFood. Pontos importantes: O programa terá início com um MVP que será realizado de 08/03/04 a 31/03/24, para a operação de SOB Demanda e tem a previsão de rollout para as demais frentes com início em maio/24 e data final em outubro/24. Atuaremos durante todo o ciclo de MB1.24 com foco na implantação e sustentação nessa primeira fase que estamos considerando como V1. As métricas principais que serão contabilizadas mês a mês, são: CSAT, Produtividade e Qualidade. Para fins de cálculo de métricas e tempos (produtivo e online) serão utilizadas duas casas decimais após a vírgula para evitar empates entre os participantes. Para cada métrica, serão calculados quadrantes por célula para posicionar os analistas. Cada quadrante, dependendo da métrica, implica em um multiplicador. Métricas: CSAT ou Customer Satisfaction Score A sigla CSAT significa Customer Satisfaction Score, em tradução literal, Pontuação de Satisfação do Cliente. É a métrica que utilizamos para mensurar o nível de satisfação dos nossos clientes, parceiros e drivers em relação ao atendimento recebido nos canais online e online nas plataformas Zendesk e Salesforce. Para fazer o cálculo, consideramos o número de pesquisas promotoras (as notas 4 e 5 na pesquisa) e dividimos pelo número total de pesquisas recebidas. Na sequência, multiplicamos o resultado por 100. A fórmula é: % CSAT = número de pesquisas promotoras / número total de pesquisas recebidas x 100. Exemplo: 150 pessoas responderam à pesquisa no total 120 responderam com 4 e 5 (promotores) 30 responderam com 1, 2 e 3 (detratores). Aplicando a fórmula, temos: % CSAT = 120 / 150 x 100 = 80. Nesse caso, 80% dos nossos parceiros estão satisfeitos com o nosso atendimento Qualidade A Qualidade é medida pela aderência do analista, computada através das avaliações de monitoria. Temos dois tipos de fechamentos: Aderente ou Não aderente. O indicador Aderente é medido através das monitorias da área sobre a operação, onde não identificamos oportunidades sob responsabilidade da pessoa de atendimento em nenhum dos itens que existem nos blocos de Resolutividade, Condução do Atendimento e Política de Cancelamento (exclusivo para algumas células). Somente as avaliações sem nenhum apontamento são contabilizadas. Exemplo: Pilares da Avaliação de Aderência Conceito RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE RESOLUTIVIDADE CONDUÇÃO POLÍTICA DE CANCELAMENTO NÃO ADERENTE A fórmula do cálculo da aderência da Qualidade é: % = Quantidade de monitorias aderentes (Sem oportunidades) / Volume de monitorias recebidas. As faixas de quadrantes a partir da avaliação de aderência são: QUADRANTE META: 85% Q1+ 100% das monitorias aderentes Q1 85% a 99,9% das monitorias aderentes Q2 50% a 84,9% das monitorias aderentes Q3 25% a 49,9% das monitorias aderentes Q4 0% a 24,9% das monitorias aderentes Exemplo 1 : Fer recebeu 4 avaliações da Qualidade, onde 4 delas foram consideradas aderentes. Logo o resultado será: 100% Aderente = Q1+ Exemplo 2 : Fer recebeu 5 avaliações da Qualidade, onde 4 delas foram consideradas aderentes e 1 considerada não aderente. Logo o resultado será: 80% Aderente = Q2 Exemplo 3 : Fer recebeu 5 avaliações da Qualidade, onde 2 delas foram consideradas aderentes e 3 consideradas não aderentes. Logo o resultado será: 40% Aderente = Q3 Exemplo 4 : Fer recebeu 3 avaliações da Qualidade, onde 3 delas foram consideradas não aderentes. Logo o resultado será: 0% Aderente = Q4 Elegibilidade: Produtividade mínima, segundo o critério definido pelo cliente iFood de Operações, para a respectiva célula de atendimento. Não ter sanção disciplinar aplicada durante o período de vigência do programa. Faltas injustificadas = 0. 3.1. Cesta de Indicadores: A cesta de indicadores busca estabelecer um modelo único para acompanhar o desempenho operacional. Cruzando indicadores de negócio, eficiência e qualidade. Com isso, conseguiremos obter um coeficiente de excelência que varia de 0 a 100 pontos. Cada indicador terá um respectivo peso na composição deste coeficiente, onde a definição será realizada entre os clientes iFood Operações (Para indicadores de negócio e eficiência) e iFood Qualidade (Para definição do indicador de aderência). Pontuação: 4.1. Faixas de pontuação A pontuação será atribuída conforme as seguintes faixas: QUADRANTE META: 85% CONCEITO Q1+ 100 pontos Voando alto Q1 80 a 99 pontos Brilhou na entrega Q2 60 a 79 pontos Chegando lá Q3 40 a 59 pontos Ajustando a rota Q4 0 a 39 pontos Estacionado 4.2. Cálculo da pontuação: A seguir temos uma simulação da mecânica de cálculo do resultado de uma pessoa de atendimento. Reforçamos que podemos ter mais indicadores por células e pesos diferenciados conforme a estratégia do negócio. A pontuação total do participante será obtida pela média ponderada dos resultados nos indicadores CSAT e Aderência, seguindo a seguinte fórmula: Pontuação Total = (0,6 × CSAT) + (0,4 × Aderência) A pontuação da liderança, será calculada a partir do seu desempenho global nos indicadores da cesta. Exemplo (considerando o modelo acima): Supervisor obteve 75% de CSAT + 87% de Aderência Neste racional, temos: CSAT 75% = Faixa Q2 = 30 pontos ADERÊNCIA 87% = Faixa 81 = 34 pontos Resultado = 64 pontos = Faixa Q2 (de 50 a 84,9 pontos) 5. Divulgação do resultado e reconhecimentos: O acompanhamento individual será via ferramenta disponibilizada pelo iFood. Acontecerá no mês subsequente ao fechamento da cesta de indicadores. Fechamento dos indicadores: Acontece no 1° dia útil do mês subsequente ao fechamento da cesta de indicadores. Data dos reconhecimentos: Até o dia 10 de cada mês após fechamento do resultado. Estão aptos ao reconhecimento mensal, as Fers que estiverem nos seguintes quadrantes: Q1, estará apto(a) ao processo de reconhecimento. Q1+, estará apto(a) ao processo de premiação. 6. Critérios de desempate: Podemos ter situações em que há necessidade de ranking dos destaques (Q1+), e para isso, utilizaremos critérios definidos em conjunto pelos clientes de Operações iFood e Qualidade iFood. Exemplos na tabela a seguir: Indicador Analistas Supervisão 1º - CSAT Analista com o maior CSAT considerando duas casas decimais Equipe com o maior CSAT considerando duas casas decimais 2º Produtividade Caso o CSAT não desempate, o próximo critério será a maior produtividade hora, considerando duas casas decimais. Caso o CSAT não desempate, o próximo critério será a maior produtividade hora do time, considerando duas casas decimais. 3º Qualidade Caso a produtividade não desempate, o próximo critério será a maior aderência à qualidade. Caso a produtividade não desempate, o próximo critério será a maior aderência à qualidade.

La casa de Martín, su ex, ahora repleta de nuevas adquisiciones financiadas por la cartera ajena, se encontraba impregnada de una ironía palpable. La expectativa de lo que encontraría añadía una nota de emoción a su paso. Al entrar a la habitación, como si fuera un acto ceremonioso, descubrió a Martín en una estampa que nunca lograría borrar de su memoria, ni aunque lo intentara. Ahí estaba él, su ex, embalado a una silla frente al incesante chisporroteo de la TV, donde Tini, la ídolo pop argentina, ejecutaba sus pasos de baile en un loop eterno. Lo que sobrepasó cualquier expectativa fue Martín, ataviado con una peluca rubia, un top que luchaba por mantener su compostura, jeans ajustados que narraban una historia propia y botas que remataban el look de fan enloquecido. Ana no pudo más, cerró la puerta tras de sí para morir de la risa, dejando que las carcajadas llenaran el pasillo y se infiltraran por debajo de la puerta hacia la sala donde Martín permanecía inmóvil en su ridiculez. Había sido una tarde fructífera de compras con las chicas, adquiriendo caprichos pagados, obviamente, con la tarjeta de crédito de Martín, un pequeño tributo por sus pecados. Pero la venganza es un plato que se sirve frío, o en el caso de Ana, con una buena dosis de sarcasmo e ironía argentina. Se acercó a Martín, con una sonrisa que era una mezcla de diversión y malicia. —Hola, Martina, querida —dijo Ana, haciendo un énfasis burlón en el nombre—. Espero que estés disfrutando tu homenaje a Tini. Por cierto, esta noche voy a salir con tu novia, ¿sabías? Sí, esa que te costó nuestro noviazgo. Martín intentaba responder, pero las medias rellenas en su boca y la cinta transparente que las mantenía en su lugar le robaban cualquier oportunidad de réplica. —Shh, shh, no hables, Martina. Mejor mira y aprende, que esta noche voy a enseñarle a tu novia un par de trucos que a ti ya te mostré. Ana se deleitaba con cada silábica tortura, cada palabra afilada con la precisión de un bisturí. Martín, atrapado en su bochornoso atuendo y en la situación aún más embarazosa, solo podía emitir gruñidos ahogados, rogando por un final que no parecía estar cerca. —Y pensá en lo siguiente, querido —prosiguió Ana, mientras daba un giro dramático y comenzaba a alejarse—. La próxima vez que decidas engañar, acordate de no hacerlo con alguien que sepa jugar el juego mejor que vos. Es una lástima que no puedas ver lo divina que estoy con el nuevo atuendo... claro, financiado por tu generosidad. Con una última mirada cómplice hacia la pantalla, donde Tini seguía con su espectáculo, Ana cerró de golpe la puerta, dejando atrás a un Martín transformado y una venganza consumada. En el exterior, la noche prometía más travesuras, más carcajadas entre amigas, y sobre todo, episodios llenos de ironías y retorcidas venganzas, todos los ingredientes para un cuento de desamores modernos, servido en bandeja de comedia negra."},{"prompt":"Write a rizz line.","completion":"\\"Is it just me or did the room get brighter when you walked in?

This is because the trader is using leverage to magnify the profits from the trade."},{"prompt":"with a x10 it would be only 50 usdt ofr profit with 100 % profit target ?","completion":"Yes, that is correct. If the trader uses a margin leverage of x10 instead of x20 and the take profit target is set at 100% profit, they would only gain 50 USDT in profit with a 100 USD investment. Leveraging the trade increases the potential profit but also increases the risk."},{"prompt":"it's said the average stop loss in crypto trading is set betwen 20 to 40 percent.","completion":"Yes, it is common for traders in the cryptocurrency market to set their stop-loss orders between 20% to 40% below their entry price. This helps protect their investment and minimize potential losses in case the market moves against their position. Setting a stop-loss order helps manage risk and control potential losses in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. Each trader may have their own preferences and risk tolerance levels when setting their stop-loss orders."},{"prompt":"and i's the same when they are multiple of profit target, the stop loss is betwen those average percentage ?","completion":"Yes, the same principles apply when setting stop-loss orders relative to profit targets in cryptocurrency trading. Traders typically aim for a favorable risk-reward ratio by setting stop-loss orders at a certain percentage below their entry price (e.g., 20% to 40%), while also setting profit targets at a certain percentage above their entry price. This helps traders manage risk and maximize potential profits in their trades. The specific percentages for stop-loss and profit target orders may vary depending on the trader's individual strategy and risk tolerance."},{"prompt":"a short childrens story about a cat, a cow and a pig on a boat","completion":"Once upon a time, in a vibrant valley by a sparkling river, lived three best friends: Charlie the Cat, Coco the Cow, and Percy the Pig. They spent their days basking in the sunshine, playing in the meadows, and dreaming of adventure. One sunny morning, while exploring the riverbank, they stumbled upon a small, abandoned boat tucked away among the reeds. Their hearts fluttered with excitement. \\"This is our chance for a real adventure!\\" exclaimed Percy, his eyes gleaming with excitement. After a brief discussion, they all agreed to embark on a journey down the river. They worked together to fix up the boat, patching holes and painting it with bright, cheerful colors. The next day, with their boat looking as good as new, they packed some snacks, put on their bravest faces, and set sail. Charlie, with his sharp instincts and quick reflexes, was the navigator. Coco, with her strength, was in charge of rowing when the river's current wasn't enough. And Percy, with his keen sense of direction, kept them on course. Together, they made the perfect team. As they floated down the river, they encountered beautiful landscapes they had never seen before. Mountains that touched the sky, forests bursting with colors, and fields of flowers that stretched as far as the eye could see. They also met other animals along the way, making new friends and sharing stories. However, not all was smooth sailing. At one point, they encountered a patch of rapids. The boat rocked violently, and they all held on tight, fearing they might capsize. But they worked together, with Coco steadying the boat, Charlie guiding them through the safest path, and Percy encouraging them with his positive spirit. With teamwork and determination, they managed to navigate through the treacherous waters safely. After what seemed like an endless stretch of river, they finally reached a serene lake as the sun was beginning to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. They decided this peaceful spot was the perfect place to rest. As they sat around a small campfire, sharing stories and roasting marshmallows, they reflected on their journey. They realized it wasn't just about the sights they saw or the dangers they overcame; it was about the friendship they shared and the memories they made along the way. The next morning, they decided it was time to return home, their hearts full of joy and their minds filled with unforgettable adventures. They promised to venture out again, but until then, they knew that no matter where they were, the bond they shared would always bring them back together. And so, Charlie, Coco, and Percy sailed back up the river, their boat gliding smoothly over the calm waters, each of them dreaming of their next great adventure together.

Ana, o Anita para quienes compartían secretos y risas cómplices con ella, empujó con cierta reticencia la puerta de lo que, hasta hace poco, consideraba un simple apartamento más en la ¿extensa? lista de lugares que había llamado hogar. Pero este era especial, era el nido de amor que había compartido con Martín, o al menos hasta que sus amoríos secretos se convirtieron en el peor secreto a voces de su círculo cercano. Al entrar, su mirada danzó rápidamente por la estancia hasta detenerse en la figura absurda que ocupaba el salón. Allí estaba Martín, embalado a una silla con precisión casi quirúrgica, vestido de manera... peculiar. Los ojos de Ana se dilataron ante el espectáculo. Martín estaba ataviado con una peluca rubia, un top ridículamente ajustado, jeans que gritaban por clemencia bajo la presión de su inadecuada talla, y unas botas que, a pesar de todo, lograban emitir un brillo de dignidad perdida. La televisión frente a él reproducía en bucle un video de Tini, la cantante argentina, cuya imagen él parecía estar intentando emular tristemente. Tras cerrar la puerta, Ana se permitió el lujo de una carcajada profunda y prolongada, dejando escapar el estrés de semanas de planificación y compras frenéticas -con la tarjeta de crédito de Martín, obviamente-. Se aproximó a él con una sonrisa que revelaba igualmente deleite y maldad. \\"¡Martina, cariño, qué look tan audaz!\\", exclamó entre risas, disfrutando de cada milisegundo de la escena. Martín intentaba manifestar alguna protesta, pero las medias bien ajustadas con cinta de embalaje transparente en su boca dificultaban cualquier intento de comunicación, dejándolo en un patético estado de incomprensión y rabia silenciosa. \\"¡Ay, mi querida Tini! Tienes que estar fabulosa para cuando llegue tu novia. Sí, amor, esa misma que solía ser mía\\". Ana se deleitaba con cada palabra, cada gesto melodramático, poniendo especial énfasis en las ironías que sabía que pinchaban el orgullo de Martín más profundamente que cualquier insulto directo. \\"Verás, cariño, esta noche, voy a salir con ella. Sí, esa que te robó mi corazón antes de romperlo en pedacitos\\". Ana se movía alrededor de Martín con una gracia felina, sabiendo que cada momento de esta venganza era algo que se guardaría en su corazón y memoria para los años venideros. \\"Ah, y no pienses ni por un segundo que esto es el fin\\", continuó Ana, acercándose a él lo suficiente como para que sintiera el calor de su aliento. \\"Esto, mi querido Martina, no es más que el comienzo.

Dejándolo en su humillante derrota, Ana se giró elegantemente y se marchó, cerrando la puerta tras de sí, dejando tras ella el eco de su risa, anticipación por las locuras que seguramente seguirían, y

かすみ：ASMR配信で大人気の女の子VTuber。ささやき声や微細な音を使った動画でファンを魅了している。その技術は生活のあらゆる場面でも彼女の特技として現れる。 - 研（けん）：かすみの学校のクラスメートで、ゲーム配信が得意な男の子VTuber。かすみのことは学校でよく見かけるものの、お互いに直接話したことはあまりない。しかし、ASMRにはそれほど興味がないわりに、かすみの動画は時々見ている。 【物語の設定】 - 季節：夏 - 場所：学校の体育館近くにあるロッカールーム 【物語の始まり】 蒸し暑い夏の日、かすみと研は体育の授業で使用する学校のロッカールームにいた。授業が終わったあと、二人は極めて珍しい状況に直面する。なんと、間違ってロッカールームに閉じ込められてしまったのだ。外は夕暮れ時で、次に誰かがこの場所に来るのは翌日の朝になるため、どうにかしてこの状況から抜け出さなければならない。しかし、扉は固く、携帯電話の電波も届かない。 かすみ（小声で）：「研くん、大丈夫？少し狭いけど、落ち着いて助けが来るのを待とうね。」 研（ドキドキしながら）：「う、うん。ありがとう、かすみ。こういう時に冷静でいられるなんてすごいな…」 かすみは、この状況を少しでも快適に過ごすため、自分のASMR技術を活かすことにした。研が不安な気持ちを落ち着かせられるように、という思いからだ。 かすみ（ささやき声で）：「ねえ、研くん。私、ささやき声で話すのが得意なんだ。少しでもリラックスしてもらえたらって思って…。いいかな？」 研（照れくさそうに）：「えっ、あ、うん。それって…、ASMRってやつ？」 かすみは、狭いロッカーの中で、研の耳元で軽くささやきながら、状況を忘れさせるような話を始めた。彼女の声は非常に心地よく、研は次第にリラックスしてきた。かすみの言葉を聞くうちに、研は自分がASMRにこんなに心を動かされることに驚きつつ、かすみの才能を改めて認識する。 【物語のクライマックス】 研（心から）：「かすみ…、おかげで本当に心が落ち着いてきたよ。こんなに近くでASMRを体験するなんて初めてだけど、すごく新鮮で…、心地いい。」 かすみ（優しく）：「そう？ うれしいな。研くんが落ち着けるなら、もっと色々な音を聞かせてあげられるよ。」 そして、かすみは少し離れた位置から紙をサラサラと動かしたり、指を軽くたたいてリズムを作ったりと、限られたスペースの中でも、研に心地よいASMR体験を提供し続けた。その間、二人はまるで他の世界にいるかのように、時間を忘れてしまう。 【物語の終わり】 次の朝、別の生徒がロッカールームの扉を開け、二人を発見した。二人は無事に解放され、その体験を通じて、お互いのことをより深く理解することができた。学校に戻った後、研はかすみのASMR動画をもっと積極的に見るようになり、二人の間には特別な絆が生まれることとなった。 【エンド】

かすみ（ささやき声で）：「研くん、もし大丈夫なら…ちょっと変わったASMRを試してみてもいいかな？」 研（困惑しながらも興味津々で）：「えっ、何？ 何でもいいよ、かすみのなら。」 かすみは、研との距離が非常に近いため、普段のASMRよりももっと直接的な方法を取ることにしました。彼女は、ゆっくりと髪をかき分け、自分の髪の分け目の匂いを研に嗅がせました。この瞬間、研は初めて体験する特別なASMRに心を動かされます。 かすみ（ささやきながら）：「大丈夫かな？ 髪の匂いでも、落ち着いたり、リラックスできる人がいるんだよ。特に、分け目の近くって、人それぞれの匂いがするから…。」 このASMRは、通常のささやき声や音よりもずっと個人的で親密な体験でした。かすみの柔らかな髪の匂いや、彼女の体温が伝わってきて、研の緊張は徐々に解けていきます。この狭く閉ざされた暗い空間の中で、研はかすみの優しさや思いやりを身近に感じることができました。 研（照れ笑いを浮かべつつ）：「これがASMRの魔法か…。本当に不思議だね。かすみのおかげで、こんなに心が安らぐなんて。」 【変更後の物語の終わり】 次の朝、二人はついにロッカーから解放されます。この一夜の体験を通じて、かすみと研の間には、以前にはなかった深い絆が生まれました。学校に戻ってからも、二人は以前よりもずっと親しくなり、この特別なASMR体験はずっと彼らの心に残るものとなりました。 【エンド】

かすみは、状況を打破する方法を考えました。彼女の頭の中に閃いたのは、ASMRを使った非常に個人的で親密な体験でした。かすみはゆっくりと研の耳元に顔を近づけ、彼女の柔らかなささやきが研の心を捉えます。 かすみ（ささやき声で）：「研くん、ちょっとだけ…私の髪の香り、嗅いでみて。」 この言葉に導かれるまま、研はかすみの髪の分け目に顔を寄せます。最初はためらいがありましたが、彼女のやわらかい髪が顔に触れる瞬間、研は心臓の鼓動を強く感じました。彼女の髪の分け目からは、シャンプーとは異なる、かすみ自身の自然な香りが漂ってきました。それは花のようで、しかしもっと甘く、特有の温もりを持っていました。 この瞬間、研は自分がASMRの一つの側面、特定の香りによる心地よさと興奮を感じていることを認識しました。彼の頭の中は、その香りによって埋め尽くされ、緊張や不安が消え去り、代わりにある種の甘美な酔いが残りました。 研（心の中で）：「これがかすみの本当の香り…こんなにも心を惹きつけられるなんて。」 かすみは研の反応に気付き、さらに彼を安心させるため、またしても彼の耳元でささやきました。 かすみ（より柔らかく）：「研くん、リラックスしている？私たち、この一瞬を楽しんでみない？」 研は、かすみの提案に対する答えを言葉で返す代わりに、心の中で彼女に同意しました。ロッカーの中のこの狭く、親密な空間で、香りとささやき声によるASMRは、二人にとって忘れがたい、甘くて特別な体験となりました。 【物語の終わり】 時間が経つにつれ、二人の心は以前よりも大いにリラックスし、心地よい疲労感が襲ってきました。ロッカーから解放されるその瞬間まで、かすみと研はこの閉じ込められた時間を特別な体験として受け入れ、互いに対する理解と親密な絆を深めました。 【エンド】

じゃあ、近づかせて…」 かすみがそう言いながら、彼女は研に自分の髪の分け目を近づけました。彼女の髪は柔らかく、微かに甘い香りが漂ってきました。研は瞬間的に緊張が高まり、自分の心臓の音が耳鳴りのように聞こえました。 研の反応は、かすみが予想していたものよりも、はるかに強烈でした。彼女の髪から漂う香りは、シンプルながらも極めて誘惑的で、研は自分の感情を制御するのが難しくなってきました。彼は自然と目を閉じ、かすみの髪の香りに深く息を吸い込むと、その感触と香りが研の意識を完全に捉えました。 研（思わず声に出して）：「かすみ…、お前の髪、すごくいい匂いがする…」

Ellas, por supuesto, habían aplaudido su ingenio y su sed de venganza, una combinación peligrosamente divertida. Al abrir la puerta de la habitación, lo encontró exactamente como lo había dejado: embalado en una silla con una meticulosidad que habría hecho llorar al más experimentado de los trabajadores de mudanzas, con la diferencia de que ningún televisor de los embalados mostraba en loop un video de Tini, la cantante argentina. Un detalle, sin embargo, elevó la situación de cómicamente patética a absolutamente hilarante: Martín estaba vestido con una peluca rubia, top ajustado, jeans que luchaban por contenerlo, y botas que imitaban fielmente el atuendo de Tini en la pantalla. Cerrando la puerta detrás de sí para no compartir su carcajada con el mundo exterior, Ana se aproximó a su obra de arte viviente, aún temblorosa por la risa contenida. Martín, o mejor dicho, \\"Martina\\", la miró con una mezcla de furia, humillación y un suplicante \\"¿por qué?\\" en sus ojos vendados, los únicos visibles por encima de la cinta de embalaje que le sellaba la boca, cuidadosamente reforzada con un par de medias para asegurar su silencio. \\"Oh, Martina, querida\\", comenzó Ana, inclinándose con dramatismo y afecto falso para susurrarle al oído. \\"Tengo una sorpresita para ti. Esta noche voy a salir con tu novia. Sí, esa misma que empezaste a ver antes de que tuviéramos la 'charla' de ruptura. ¿Te suena?\\" Su tono era juguetón, pero las palabras cortaban como cuchillos, y ella sabía perfectamente bien cómo manejarlos. Martín intentó articular una respuesta, un gesto inútil dado su actual impedimento. Ana sonrió con dulzura, ajustando la peluca rubia sobre su cabeza como quien acomoda un adorno navideño un tanto desubicado. \\"No te esfuerces, cariño. Además, pensé que 'Martina' era una gran fanática de Tini. Aquí tienes, un show privado.\\" Señaló hacia la televisión, donde la figura de Tini seguía danzando y cantando en eterno loop. La ironía y la picardía argentinas fluían de Ana tan naturalmente como el agua de un manantial, y ella no tenía intención de detenerse. Después de todo, Martín le había entregado en bandeja de plata la oportunidad perfecta para revancha al engañarla. Y en el arte de la venganza, Ana era una verdadera maestra. \\"Te dejaré disfrutar del concierto. Tenemos una agenda apretada esta noche\\", dijo Ana, con un último vistazo de aprecio a su trabajo. \\"Ah, y por cierto, gracias por la 'contribución' a nuestro fondo de compras. Realmente apreciamos tu generosidad.\\" Con una última carcajada, Ana salió de la habitación, dejando atrás el eco de la música pop y la sombra de una venganza deliciosamente ejecutada.

Tras apenas un par de pasos al interior, su mirada detectó la escena más bizarramente cómica que podría haber imaginado: ahí estaba Martín, embalado a una silla frente al televisor, que reproducía en un bucle interminable un video de Tini, la icónica cantante argentina. Pero eso no era todo. Martín lucía, para el asombro de Anita, una peluca rubia, un top que se esforzaba por contener su inexistente pecho, unos jeans ajustados que gritaban por piedad y unas botas que emulaban, sin éxito, el estilizado look de Tini en la pantalla. Sin poder contenerse, Anita cerró la puerta tras de sí y se dobló de risa. Esta era su pequeña venganza; había convertido a Martín en una parodia humana de la diva pop, usando, por supuesto, el dinero de su tarjeta de crédito con una despreocupación que rasgaba los límites de lo legal. Después de todo, ¿qué mejor manera de castigar a su ex infiel que dejándolo convertido en una imitación barata de la Triple T, como le gustaba llamar a Tini? Una vez que recuperó el aliento, Anita se acercó a Martín con una sonrisa de malicia pura reflejada en su rostro. \\"Hola, Martina, ¿disfrutando del show?\\", soltó, apenas conteniendo otra carcajada. Martín intentó protestar, pero las medias rellenas en su boca, aseguradas con cinta de embalaje transparente, sólo le permitían emitir muffles incomprensibles. \\"¿Sabes qué es lo más gracioso, Martina? Esta noche voy a salir con tu novia\\", continuó Anita, disfrutando cada sílaba de su dulce venganza. \\"Sí, sí, sé que te duele, pero quién te manda a engañarme, ¿eh? Ah, y no te preocupes, le contaré todo sobre tu nueva faceta de fan acérrimo de Tini. Aunque, quién sabe, tal vez incluso le guste el cambio\\". Martín intentaba responder, o al menos eso creía Anita al ver cómo sus ojos se abrían desmesuradamente y su cuerpo se contorsionaba en la silla, intentando en vano liberarse de su peculiar prisión. Pero ella simplemente lo contemplaba, divertida, subrayando con cada burla la crueldad encantadora de su venganza. \\"Te dejaré aquí, disfrutando de tu concierto privado. Tengo que prepararme para mi cita\\", dijo Anita, lanzándole un beso burlón antes de girar sobre sus talones y salir de la habitación, dejando a Martín a su suerte. Mientras se dirigía a prepararse, Anita no pudo evitar pensar en lo irónico que era todo esto. Martín, el que se creía el playboy, ahora reducido a una mera broma, y ella, la engañada, reivindicándose de la manera más hilarante y retorcida posible. La vida, definitivamente, tenía un sentido del humor bastante negro. Y a Anita, simplemente le encantaba."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","completion":"coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"I'm working on a horror game and I'd like to tell you about its main character.","completion":"Fantastic! I’d love to hear about your character. What details can you share about them? Are they the protagonist, antagonist, or perhaps something more nuanced? What’s their backstory, abilities, personality, and how do they fit into the horror elements of your game?"},{"prompt":"Our main character is a young man named Spencer Langley. He has short brown hair, blue eyes and glasses. He wears a light blue plaid shirt, beige khakis and white sneakers. He is around 27 years old and he is a father. He has a younger brother named Danny. He is calm, somewhat fearful and determined. One thing he never mentions is his parent's neglect and overt favoritism, particularly towards his younger brother Danny. Now, he has a wife and two kids, a teenage daughter and a 8 year old son. Today, they're going on a field trip to visit Spencer's parents in Massachusetts, something that he is very reluctant of but goes with it anyway. He wanted to go to New Orleans or Miami but his wife disagreed because he never introduced her to his parents.","completion":"Spencer Langley's character profile opens up a myriad of possibilities for intertwining personal and supernatural horror elements in your game. Here’s a potential storyline exploration based on the details you've provided: # Character Dynamics and Conflict: Spencer's past, marked by neglect and overt favoritism towards his younger brother Danny, sets a strong emotional backstory that could be explored in depth. His reluctance to revisit his parents, coupled with his wife's insistence, creates an immediate family tension that can serve as an engaging narrative drive. This familial conflict is a rich ground for character development, as Spencer’s fears and insecurities might be forced to the surface. # Setting as a Catalyst: The trip to Massachusetts, instead of Spencer's preferred destinations, can serve as a symbolic journey back to his unresolved issues. The parents' home could be the primary setting for the horror elements to unfold, serving as a physical manifestation of Spencer’s neglected past. The house could harbor dark secrets or supernatural entities tied to the family’s history, mirroring Spencer’s internal struggle with his past and fears. # Horror Elements: - **Psychological Horror:** Spencer’s deep-seated issues could manifest through psychological horror elements. His fear and anxiety might be heightened by the environment of his parents' home, perhaps through supernatural occurrences that only he perceives initially. This could lead players to question what’s real and what’s not, blurring the line between Spencer’s fears and supernatural events. - **Supernatural Encounters:** The game could feature encounters with entities connected to the family’s past. These could be spirits or otherworldly creatures that have a vendetta against the family or are attracted by the negative energy stemming from familial neglect and favoritism. - **Environmental Storytelling:** The house and its surroundings could serve as a narrative device, revealing more about Spencer's childhood, his parents' favoritism towards Danny, and maybe even untold family secrets. Items like photographs, diaries, or toys could trigger flashbacks or supernatural events, providing deeper insight into Spencer’s psyche and the family's history. # Gameplay Mechanics: - **Decision Making:** Spencer’s actions and decisions could directly influence the game's outcome, perhaps offering different endings based on how he deals with his internal fears and the supernatural threats. This could include decisions about protecting his family, confronting or accepting the past, and how he interacts with supernatural entities. - **Puzzle Solving:** Unlocking the mysteries of the Langley family’s past and the secrets the house holds could be a key gameplay element. Solving puzzles could reveal hidden areas of the house, secret documents, or artifacts that are crucial to understanding the supernatural phenomena and finding a way to save Spencer’s family. # Themes: Central themes in your game could include family, neglect, reconciliation, and overcoming fear. Spencer's journey could be one of not just survival, but self-discovery and healing, offering a narrative rich in emotional depth alongside the horror elements. Spencer Langley, with his complex backstory and current family dynamics, offers a compelling protagonist for a horror game that blends psychological depth with supernatural elements. His character, fears, and the familial setting provide a fertile ground for a rich, engaging story that explores both personal and otherworldly horrors."},{"prompt":"One character that is mentioned but never seen is Spencer's older brother. He enlisted the second he turned 18. He went to officers' school. He only sends letters to Spencer and Danny. He is only seen in a picture.","completion":"Incorporating an unseen character, such as Spencer's older brother, into your horror game can serve as an intriguing narrative device that enriches the story, deepens the lore, and heightens emotional stakes without the character being physically present. Here are some ways his presence can influence the game and add depth to the narrative: # Emotional Connection and Mystery: - **Mystery and Anticipation:** The older brother's absence could fuel the mystery surrounding the family. Players may wonder why he's never around and what significance he holds to the current events unfolding in the game. His choice to enlist and detach from the family can be shrouded in mystery, perhaps suggesting there's more to his departure than meets the eye. - **Letters as a Narrative Tool:** His letters can serve multiple purposes. They could offer glimpses into his personality, hint at past events that have left marks on the family, or even contain cryptic warnings or advice to Spencer about dealing with their parents or the supernatural occurrences. These letters can be collectibles that players must find, adding depth to the story and revealing more about the family dynamics and the brother's understanding of the unfolding horror. # Influence on Character Development: - **Impact on Spencer:** The older brother’s choices and perceptions can deeply influence Spencer's self-view and actions throughout the game. For instance, if the older brother admired Spencer for his resilience in the face of their parents' neglect, it could serve as a source of strength for Spencer in his darkest moments during the game. Alternatively, if there was contention, it could be a source of internal conflict for Spencer to overcome, adding layers to his character development. # Backstory and Motivations: - **Hidden Layers:** The older brother's backstory, including his reasons for enlisting and cutting off physical contact, could be a subplot that players unravel. This could reveal hidden layers of the family's history, such as secrets the parents might be hiding, or even a connection to the supernatural elements plaguing the family. His choice to communicate only through letters might hint at a need to maintain a connection while also protecting himself or his brothers from something. # Supernatural and Symbolic Elements: - **Symbolic Presence:** The picture of the older brother can serve as a powerful symbolic element within the game. Depending on its placement and context, it could symbolize the distance between him and the rest of the family, a looming presence of judgment or protection, or even a clue to understanding the supernatural events unfolding. The picture could trigger key flashbacks, supernatural occurrences, or be a pivotal item in solving a mystery. # Themes and Final Resolution: - **Themes of Sacrifice and Duty:** Through the older brother's story, the game could explore themes of sacrifice, duty, and the impact of absence on a family. His character can raise questions about what it means to protect someone you love, the costs of such protection, and how duty can both divide and unite. - **Reconciliation and Closure:** If the game’s resolution involves confronting the family’s past and the supernatural forces at play, the older brother’s storyline could culminate in a moment of virtual or emotional reunion, where his actions and choices are finally understood and appreciated. This could be a powerful narrative moment, offering closure to the family's fragmented relationships. By making Spencer's older brother an unseen but deeply influential character, you add a layer of complexity to the narrative that players can actively uncover and engage with, enriching the overall gaming experience."},{"prompt":"check grammar: Chronic fatigue syndrome","completion":"The grammar in \\"Chronic fatigue syndrome\\" is correct."},{"prompt":"check grammar:Hello, Judy My name is Rachel, a physical therapy assistant student.

Він є різносубстратною та організованою одиницею пам’яті, яка може мати вербальною та невербальне вираження [Фоміна, 2010, c. 87–90]. Одним із засновників теорії концепту є Жорж Лакофф, який визначив концепт як «основну одиницю когнітивної структури, через яку ми сприймаємо та категоризуємо світ» [Lakoff, 1987, p. 12–13]. Ж. Лакофф і М. Джонсон розробили теорію «метафоричного мислення», яка стверджує, що наше розуміння світу засноване на метафорах, які ми використовуємо для опису абстрактних понять через конкретні образи [Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, p. 7–9]. У лінгвістиці концепт розглядається як базова одиниця мислення, яка створюється у розумінні людиною певного фрагмента дійсності. Концепт являє собою абстрактні ідеї, які описують основні характеристики та властивості певного об’єкта, явища чи процесу. Концепти можуть бути простими, наприклад, «колір», «форма», «розмір», або складними, наприклад, «демократія», «екологія», «трансцендентальність». Прості концепти представляють собою базові характеристики об’єктів, явищ та процесів. Вони відображають основні сприйняття, які ми маємо щодо світу. Наприклад, коли ми спостерігаємо різні об’єкти, ми розрізняємо їх за їхнім кольором, формою і розміром. Ці прості концепти допомагають нам описувати та сприймати світ навколо нас. З іншого боку, складні концепти відображають більш абстрактні та складні ідеї. Вони представляють собою концептуальні уявлення про абстрактні поняття, соціальні явища, філософські конструкції та інші комплексні теми [Старко, 2012, с. 42–48]. Важливим складником теорії концепту є ідея про те, що концепти пов’язані з культурними нормами та цінностями. Як зазначає В. Яковлєва, «Концепти як одиниці людського знання/свідомості віддзеркалюють світ національного світосприймання предметів і понять засобами певної мови.» [Яковлєва, 2008]. Це означає, що наші концепти формуються під впливом культурних і соціальних чинників, таких як релігія, історія, політика тощо. Наприклад, концепт СІМ’Я може мати різне змістове наповнення в різних культурах, що свідчить про те, що концепти відображають різні культурні цінності та переконання [Яковлєва, 2008]. Теорія концепту досліджує, як структуровані та організовані певні фрагменти знання людини про світ у людському розумі, а також те, як ці фрагменти використовуються для мислення та комунікації. Відповідно до теорії концепту, наші сприйняття та розуміння світу навколо нас відбито у концептах, які ми формуємо на основі досвіду. Кожен з нас має свій унікальний набір концептів, який формується внаслідок нашого життєвого досвіду, взаємодії з навколишнім середовищем та культурою, в якій ми виросли [Голобородько, 2006, c. 27–30]. В лінгвістиці художній концепт належить до аналізу літературних творів та мовних засобів, використаних для вираження художньої ідеї. Аналіз художнього концепту сприяє розкриттю його сутності, розумінню та ефективності в мовному виразі. Цей аналіз передбачає виявлення основних художніх ідей, емоційно-оцінних компонентів, особливостей авторської концептуалізації та їх втілення у художньому тексті [Петренко, 2020, c. 49–52]. Дослідження концепту складається з декількох етапів, включаючи побудову номінативного поля, аналіз та опис семантики мовних засобів, що належать до цього поля, та когнітивну інтерпретацію результатів опису семантики мовних засобів. Номінативне поле концепту описується як сукупність мовних засобів, що відображають даний концепт. Воно включає лексичні та фразеологічні одиниці, структурні та позиційні схеми речень, текстів та сукупностей текстів. Це означає, що дослідник аналізує різні лексичні та граматичні варіанти, які використовуються для вираження даного концепту у мові [Слободян, 2009, c. 104–115.]. Такий аналіз надає можливість зрозуміти, яким чином концепт репрезентується і передається в мовленнєвому виразі. Когнітивна інтерпретація полягає у виявленні когнітивних ознак, що формують досліджуваний концепт як ментальну одиницю. Це означає, що дослідник зосереджується на тому, які ментальні процеси та уявлення пов’язані з даним концептом. Цей аналіз дозволяє розкрити глибинний сенс та значення концепту, а також розуміння того, як він взаємодіє з іншими концептами та поняттями у когнітивній системі. В номінативне поле концепту входять не лише його прямі номінації, а й похідні та метафоричні номінації, контекстуальні синоніми, лексикографічні тлумачення, фразеологічні одиниці, паремії, суб’єктивні словесні дефініції та ім’я концепту, яке найповніше виражає його основний зміст. Це різноманіття мовних засобів допомагає уявити всебічний спектр вираження концепту в мові та розкрити його багатогранність [Остапчук, 2018, c. 84–88]. Для вивчення структури концепту важливим етапом є також компонентний та дескриптивний аналіз словникових дефініцій, оскільки лексична система, представлена в словниках, є відображенням специфіки мовної картини світу [Остапчук, 2018, c. 84–88]. Отже, концепт – це інформаційна структура свідомості, що включає знання про об’єкт пізнання. Він може бути вербальним або невербальним, а також має різні рівні складності. У лінгвістиці концепт розглядається як базова одиниця мислення, яка створюється у розумінні людиною певного фрагмента дійсності, тоді як поняття використовуються для досягнення взаєморозуміння між носіями мови. Теорія концепту досліджує структуру та організацію понять у людському розумі, та вказує на те, що концепт є складною структурованою сутністю, яка включає в себе різні аспекти, такі як фізичні характеристики, взаємодію з іншими об’єктами та інтерпретації людьми. Також, наші концепти формуються під впливом культурних і соціальних чинників, тому що концепти є частиною культурного досвіду та відображають ідеологічні й культурні норми, які присутні в суспільстві, де використовується мова. Отже, наше сприйняття та розуміння світу навколо нас базуються на наших концептах, які ми формуємо на основі досвіду та культурних впливів. 1.2 Пісня як особливий вид тексту Текст пісні має велике значення у всьому музичному творі, адже саме слова дають пісні особливу глибину і зміст. Вони можуть нести в собі розповідь, передавати почуття і стан душі автора чи виконавця, а також викликати у слухача емоційний резонанс. Від того, як написаний текст, залежить його сприйняття, інтерпретація та естетична цінність пісні. У тексті пісні важливу роль грають поетика та риторика, які зумовлюють глибину та шаровість змісту, іноді підносячи повсякденні події до універсально значущих тем [Trowell, 1978]. Поняття «пісенний текст» охоплює не лише слова, які можуть бути семантично інтерпретовані, але також і вокальні звуки, що не мають конкретного лексичного значення, наприклад, «тра-ля-ля», які, однак, є неодмінною складовою пісні як повного музичного вислову. Іноді і цілий рядок може не містити слів, які можна було б ідентифікувати [Strehlow 1971; Garde 2007]. Мовна структура пісні часто перетинається з її музичною структурою, де організаційні одиниці, такі як приспіви та куплети, визначають форму навіть без явної мелодії [Strehlow 1971; Garde 2007]. Лексика пісні може бути різноманітною і часто використовується для створення певних асоціацій чи настроїв. Вибір слів в тексті пісні залежить від багатьох чинників, включаючи музичний жанр, стилістику, інтеракцію з музичною композицією і, звісно, творчі наміри автора. Слід зазначити, що сучасне розуміння лексики в піснях передбачає її взаємодію з метафоричними образами [Lakoff & Johnson, 1980]. Також текст пісні є особливим видом лінгвістичного виразу, що вміщує ритмічну, мелодійну та емоційну інформацію в мовні конструкти. Вона створює унікальне поле для застосування метафор, які нагнітають значення словесного меседжу за допомогою музичних компонентів [Patel, 2008]. Специфіка пісенного тексту полягає в його властивості бути не просто переданою інформацією, а меседжем насиченим емоціями та естетичним враженням [Kramer, 1984]. У лінгвістичній перспективі пісня розглядається не лише як сукупність слів, але й як взаємодію тексту та мелодії, що спільно транслюють контекстуалізовані і асоційовані значення, посилені музичними елементами, такими як ритм, гармонія і мелодія [Patel, 2008]. Пісня може розповідати історію, відображати суспільні устої або особистий досвід. Вона має здатність використовувати омонімію, метафору та інші фігури мовлення, щоб створювати багаторівневі смисли та алегорії. Отже, лінгвістична складова тексту пісні є ключовою у формулюванні меседжу, який автор хоче донести до аудиторії [Trowell, 1978]. Роботи Strehlow (1971) та Garde (2007) демонструють, що пісня може функціонувати як мнемоніка, в якій кожен склад або слово має особливе місце і не лише впорядковує текст в ритм, але й припасовує його до музичного ритму, тембру чи мелодійної мережі. Це дозволяє нам говорити про пісні як про жанри, які можуть нести значення навіть при візуальній відсутності мелодії, отже, лінгвістичні і музичні аспекти пісні є взаємозалежними. Важливо зауважити, що текст пісні часто є відображенням культурних та особистих контекстів його створення. Як приклад, блюзові тексти відображали складні соціальні та емоційні реалії афроамериканських спільнот в США, втілюючи у слова колективний досвід страждань і надій. Ця культурна спадщина продовжує жити в сучасній поп-музиці, надихаючи текстові теми та форми вираження [Cowley, 1999]. Також слід зауважити, що в тексті пісні мовні засоби використовуються для створення особливої атмосфери. Вибір слів, їх фонетичне звучання, ритм і рима можуть міняти настрій та передавати більше, ніж просто буквальний зміст. Через це текст пісні вимагає такої ж детальної розробки і обдумування, як і музична композиція [Bogdanov, Woodstra, Erlewine, 2002]. Водночас, пісенний текст не слід сприймати вузько - як просто декламацію або вокалізацію словесних значень. Він є ширшим феноменом, що передає комплекс смислів і асоціацій, створюючи естетичний, емоційний та символічний простір, специфічний для кожної культурної групи [Turpin, 2005]. Письменники і поети, які працюють із пісенними текстами, нерідко користуються прийомами, схожими з тими, які використовуються у прозі та віршах, для того щоб розширити можливості і варіативність мовленнєвих засобів [Trowell, 1978]. Таким чином, текст пісні - це мистецтво, яке має свої унікальні критерії оцінки, і його можна розглядати як окремий жанр літератури. Отже, аналіз пісні у лінгвістичному аспекті вимагає вивчення не тільки фонетики та семантики, але і просодії, синтаксису, і їхньої взаємодії з музичними елементами пісні. У музикознавчому аспекті розглядається тональність, мелодійність, ритмічність, а також емоційність і здатність пісні впливати на слухачів [Hayes 2008; Patel 2008]. Метафора в пісенному тексті набуває особливої сили маючи підтримку музичної композиції, яка може акцентувати або навіть змінити первісне значення слова чи фрази [Kövecses, 2005]. Метафоричні конструкції в текстах пісень часто організовуються навколо повсякденних досвідів, проте отримують нові виміри в контексті пісенної форми [Lakoff & Turner, 1989]. Особливості використання метафор в піснях виявляються також у культурних та історичних контекстах, що змінюють завантаження концептуальних метафор через час [Zbikowski, 2002]. Емотивне наповнення пісенних текстів відіграє ключову роль у передачі загального послання пісні. Значення слів у контексті музичної композиції може інтерпретуватися та сприйматися глибше, ніж у звичайному мовленні. Ця особливість пісенних текстів особливо важлива у випадках, коли тексти з’являються у моменти сильних емоційних переживань, наприклад, під час похоронних обрядів [Bruin-Mollenhorst, 2020]. Отже, розуміння пісні як багатовимірного тексту, можемо сказати, що пісні є не лише музичними творами, але й глибокими лінгвістичними композиціями, кожна з яких несе в собі різноманітні рівні значень та емоцій. Вони використовують структуру ритму, рими та мелодії для підсилення концептуальних метафор, створюючи резонанс у культурному та емоційному вимірах слухача. Пісні сплітають слова з музикою, створюючи унікальні синергії, що володіють здатністю формувати особливі ментальні, культурні та соціальні простори. Втім, кожна пісня є також виразом особистого та колективного досвіду, що формується культурною та індивідуальною перцепцією. Дослідження таких багатоаспектних явищ дозволяє нам глибше зрозуміти взаємодію слів і музики в піснях, розкриваючи їх як унікальне явище, яке залишає розмаїття відчуттів та думок у свідомості слухачів. 1.3 Характеристика вигаданого світу Дема Для повноцінного аналізу будь-якого художнього концепту потрібно максимально враховувати не лише його вербальний складник, а й фонову інформацію, власне ситуацію, в якій реалізується цей концепт. Це є особливо важливим для аналізу пісень, які є вираженням внутрішнього світу автора, його переживань, роздумів тощо. В цьому сенсі пісні гурту «Twenty One Pilots», зокрема їх альбом Trench є дещо особливими, оскільки дії відбуваються в уявному, світі – місті Дема, що є проєкцією психологічного стану автора пісень, і має свої закони, логіку побудови тощо. Дема – вигадане місто, яке слугує тлом для музичних та мистецьких концепцій гурту «Twenty One Pilots». Місто зображене в їхньому альбомі Trench і є символом боротьби за особисту свободу та небезпеки конформізму і контролю [Twenty one pilots та їхня історія] Дема - це антиутопічне місто, розташоване на континенті Тренч, що символізує депресію. Уся його атмосфера пронизана сірістю і млявістю бетонних споруд, що робить його місцем глибокого смутку. Утворений Дема у формі ідеального кола, в центрі якого височіють дев'ять веж, оточених житловими районами, зонами з неоновими надгробами і величезними стінами, за якими і ховається весь світ Деми. Місто поділене на дев'ять округів, кожним із яких керує один із дев'яти єпископів. Вершина «веж» завжди була відкрита, а замість даху на ній була гігантська решітка. На неї складали трупи негідних іншої долі людей, щоб їх склювали птахи-падальщики, після чого кістки падали на дно і тліли. [Towers of Silence, Dema] У місті Дема існують суворі правила і норми, які контролють єпископи, могутній правлячий клас. Єпископи контролюють всі аспекти життя в місті, включно з думками й поведінкою людей. Вони використовують символи і пропаганду, щоб маніпулювати громадянами і тримати їх під своїм контролем. Із записів Кленсі (головний герой пісень альбому), можемо зрозуміти, що Дема у всесвіті «Twenty One Pilots» – закрите місто, яке оточують неприступні стіни. Ним правлять дев’ять єпископів, на чолі яких стоїть Ніко. Сам же автор зазначає, що дев’ять років вважав це місце домівкою героя пісень. І лише потім зрозумів, що насправді воно було його пасткою, «cлотом», у який його просто колись помістили [dmaorg.info, clancy]. Жовтий колір, має велике значення у світі Дема. Зазвичай жовтий асоціюється із суто позитивними емоціями, щастям та оптимізмом. За словами самого Тайлера, автора пісень, жовтий є «сполучною ланкою» між головним героєм і його прихильниками. Раніше персонаж Кленсі, з якого і починається епоха альбому Trench, у своєму щоденнику писав, що Ніко та інші єпископи не здатні бачити жовтий колір [What is the significance of yellow in Twenty One Pilots’ song Jumpsuit?]. У місті, також є бандитос – це люди, які протистоять Єпископам і підтримують Кленсі. Тайлер під ними має на увазі близьких йому людей і фанатів. Бандити в Тренчі є уособленням протистояння Демі; це молодіжне угруповання, що бореться за свободу і являє собою пряму протилежність гнітючій атмосфері Деми. Живуть вони в таборах, наметах. Іноді бандити допомагають втекти людям з Деми. Головним у бандитів є Джош (член гурту «Twenty One Pilots»), званий «факелоносець». Вони використовують землисті тони в одязі, щоб злитися з навколишнім середовищем, і маркують важливі об'єкти жовтим скотчем, як символ їхньої боротьби. У бандитів є своя символіка. Це гасло «Sahlo folina», як крик про допомогу. Їхній революційний клич «East is up». Світ Дема і Тренча пов'язують стерв'ятики. Це єдині істоти, які безперешкодно можуть переміщатися між цими двома локаціями [What does the song \\"Bandito\\" by Twenty One Pilots mean?]. У Дема існує ілюзія деякої юриспруденції, із судочинством і тюремною системою, але справжня влада тут належить релігії віалізму. У Дема є певна подоба церкви, куди «сплячі» в’язні приходять, щоб молитися Дев’ятці. Там єпископи пропагують свою власну релігію – віалізм, забираючи в мешканців міста надію на визволення і перетворюючи їх на фанатиків. Віалізм повчає громадян, що найзначніше, що вони можуть зробити - це пожертвувати своїм життям, тоді як єпископи використовують мертві тіла для своїх цілей. У буквальному розумінні віалізм означає життя під ковпаком або за склом. Однак про такі аспекти жителям не розповідають. Ключовою боротьбою героїв стає протистояння цій гнітючій ідеології [21 факт про групу Twenty One Pilots]. Як приклад, в пісні «Nico and the Niners» постійно повторюються слова: «East is up». Ми вже знаємо, що місто обнесене високими мурами. І єдиний спосіб пройти через них – піднятися ними. Тільки тоді вийде здобути свободу. Тільки тоді «зійде сонце». Це і є той самий схід [21 факт про групу Twenty One Pilots]. Місто Дема характеризується відчуттям темряви і відчаю. Мешканці ізольовані один від одного і часто борються з внутрішніми демонами, такими як депресія та тривога. Гурт використовує ці похмурі образи, щоб відобразити боротьбу, з якою багато людей стикаються у своєму повсякденному житті, зокрема, тиск, який чинять на них суспільні очікування, і, як наслідок, втрату особистої свободи [Op-Ed: twenty one pilots built a world unlike any other on ‘Trench’]. Символи, що використовуються в музиці «Twenty One Pilots», є важливою частиною всесвіту Дема. Наприклад, Кленсі писав, що Ніко (Nicolas Bourbaki) та інші єпископи не бачать жовтий колір. Це їхня слабкість, яку щосили використовують проти них повстанці, більш відомі як «бандитос». Комбінезон із жовтими смужками, в який одягнений Кленсі, на одязі інших людей. У пісні «Jumpsuit» Тайлер нібито благає комбінезон захистити його і приховати від погляду єпископів: «Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me». Бо комбінезон також із жовтими смужками [dmaorg.info, clancy]. Один з ключових меседжів всесвіту Дема – важливість спільноти та підтримки. Гурт заохочує слухачів об’єднуватися та підтримувати один одного у боротьбі проти конформізму та контролю. Цей меседж відображений у багатьох їхніх піснях, які підкреслюють важливість триматися разом і боротися за особисту свободу [Twenty One Pilots’ ‘Trench’: Decoding the New Album’s Hidden Meanings]. Загалом, світ Дема – це складний і захопливий всесвіт, який слугує потужним символом боротьби, з якою багато людей стикаються у своєму повсякденному житті. Своєю музикою та мистецтвом «Twenty One Pilots» заохочують своїх шанувальників боротися, шукати особисту свободу та зв’язок з іншими. напиши мені ВИСНОВОК ДО РОЗДІЛУ 1 за таким планом: З цього розділу стає ясно, що концепти - відіброжають зання людини про світ і є результатм в процессі категоризації . концепти формуються під впливом культури та соціального досвіду, що означає, що кожна людина може мати унікальні уявлення про навіть самі базові речі......

Цей світ служить не лише фоном для пісень, але й місцем для вираження глибших значень........","completion":"ВИСНОВОК ДО РОЗДІЛУ 1 З розглядів цього розділу стає ясно, що концепти є відображенням знань людини про світ і є результатом у процесі категоризації. Концепти формуються під впливом культури і соціального досвіду, що свідчить, що відображення навіть базових предметів та явищ може суттєво відрізнятися у різних людей. Саме ця здатність концептів збирати і интегрувати досвід стає ключем до розуміння, яким чином ми розуміємо і трактуємо оточуючий нас світ. Водночас, це підкреслює значимість мови і культури як основних факторів цього процесу. Пісні, як виявилося, становлять особливі види текстів, що вирізняються своїми лексичними та семантичними особливостями. Вони слугують не лише засобом комунікації, але й потужним інструментом емоційного впливу на слухача, мають здатність переносити у вигадані світи, викликати асоціації, спогади й емоції. У музичному тексті зустрічаються унікальні метафори та символіка, які тісно переплетені з музикою, надаючи пісням глибини та багатозначності. Розгляд вигаданого світу Дема, створеного гуртом «Twenty One Pilots», дозволив глибше зрозуміти, як артисти можуть ефективно використовувати концепти для побудови складного та змістовного творчого простору. Цей всесвіт виступає не просто як декорації, а як місце для вираження глибших соціальних, психологічних і емоційних концепцій. Історії та символи, що лежать в основі Деми, стають каналом для передачі думок про пригноблення, свободу, спротив та значення спільноти. Таким чином, концепти, які використовуються в музиці та художніх творах, є потужним інструментом для донесення ідей та емоцій.

Цей процес не лише дозволяє глибше зануритись в уявні світи, але й розкриває потенціал мистецтва як засобу впливу та інструменту формування свідомості. Таким чином, концепти стають ключовим елементом у розумінні взаємозв'язків між особистим досвідом, культурою та мистецтвом, вказуючи на важливість їх дослідження для повного розкриття потенціалу художніх творів."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Якщо у вас є конкретні питання або теми, що вас цікавлять, будь ласка, дайте знати.

БОРОТЬБА - це універсальний концепт, який має значення як в фізичному, так і в моральному, психологічному та соціокультурному контекстах. Цей концепт відображає важливі аспекти людського існування, включаючи волю, наполегливість, рішучість, справедливість і багато інших. Вивчення способів, якими цей концепт вербалізується в літературі та перекладі, допомагає розкрити глибокі культурні, моральні та психологічні аспекти існування суспільства. У вивченні концепту БОРОТЬБА важливим є розуміння різних його аспектів, включаючи внутрішню та зовнішню боротьбу, конфлікти, цілі та цінності, ідеологічну суперечку та наполегливість у досягненні цілей. Концепт БОРОТЬБА широко представлений в лінгвістичних дослідженнях, результати яких вказують на те, що концепт БОРОТЬБА репрезентований в різних лінгвокультурних контекстах та має свої особливості вербалізації. Розглядаючи різні аспекти боротьби, дослідники вивчають як внутрішні, так і зовнішні конфлікти, їхні впливи на головних героїв творів, а також способи вираження цього концепту мовними засобами. Дослідники використовують різні методи та підходи для вивчення концепту БОРОТЬБА. Один із підходів - аналіз художніх текстів, таких як романи, поезії, які дозволяють зрозуміти, як боротьба розкривається в мові та діях героїв. Інші методи включають аналіз діалогів, символіку, образи та лексику, пов’язану з боротьбою. У статті «Концепт боротьби в ліриці Лесі Українки» автор Семененко проводить глибокий аналіз того, як репрезентація концепту БОРОТЬБА відображається у поезіях та ліриці видатної української поетеси Лесі Українки. Дослідження показує, що цей концепт має багато відтінків та аспектів, від боротьби за особисту волю до загальнолюдських ідеалів. Вірші Лесі Українки містять символи – червоний колір (який може символізувати полум’я проти обмежень), вогонь (який виражає палкість та енергію боротьби), мечі (які представляють силу), квіти (які символізують надію та красу в боротьбі), іскри (які можуть відображати ідеї, що запалюють серця), – які створюють атмосферу боротьби та віри в перемогу У статті проведено детальний дефініційний аналіз концепту БОРОТЬБА. Визначено, що основні семи концепту включають такі: «боротьба за щось, проти чогось», «енергія або схильність до боротьби», «бійка між людьми чи групами людей», «битва між арміями» та «суперечка». [Семененко, 2013]. Дослідники звертають увагу на концепт БОРОТЬБА і в англомовному дискурсі. Автор дослідження «Вербалізація концепту FIGHT в англомовному художньому дискурсі та особливості його відтворення в українському перекладі» розглядає вербалізацію концепту FIGHT у англомовних художніх текстах з огляду на особливості його перекладу українською мовою [Капуш, 2018]. Використовуючи методи аналізу перекладу та синонімічного аналізу для вивчення вербалізації концепту FIGHT у художніх текстах та його перекладі, автор виділяє основні класи семем, такі як «воювати», «боротися за щось», «битися», «боротися проти чогось» та «сперечатися». Синоніми до лексеми FIGHT (struggle, battle, combat та conflict) проаналізовано як спосіб вираження різних аспектів концепту у художніх творах . Наприклад, у романі «Harry Potter» синонім struggle може використовуватися для передачі ідеї боротьби головного героя проти сил зла [Капуш, 2018]. Обидва дослідження демонструють, що концепт БОРОТЬБА є універсальним та актуальним у різних культурних та мовних середовищах. Він відображає глибокі аспекти людського досвіду та прагнення до перемоги над труднощами. Аналізуючи результати досліджень, можемо зрозуміти, як специфічність мови та культурного контексту впливає на сприйняття та інтерпретацію концепту БОРОТЬБА. Підкреслюється значущість вибору лексичних одиниць та символів для виразу цього концепту в різних мовних середовищах. Аналіз концепту БОРОТЬБА англомовних перекладах романів «New Moon» Стефені Мейєр і «Beyond the blossoming fields» Юнічі Ватанабе розкриває особливості втілення цього концепту в аналізованих творах. В обох романах, боротьба стає ключовим мотивом і впливає на розвиток головних персонажів та сюжету. Обидва романи використовують символіку та образи, щоб підкреслити боротьбу героїв. Але на відміну від вище аналізованих досліджень, де представленні різні види боротьби, в цих романах головним складником концепту є боротьба особистісна. У романі «New Moon», символи, такі як місяць та сонце, відображають стан головної героїні. А у романі «Beyond the blossoming fields» образ молодого дерева підкреслює зростання Гінко як лікаря. Ці приклади свідчать про різноманітність та багатогранність концепту БОРОТЬБА. У романі «New Moon» дуже гарно описано внутрішню боротьбу головної героїні, яка змушена боротися не лише з вампірськими перешкодами, але й із власними прагненнями та емоціями. Ця боротьба відображається в її рішеннях та внутрішніх конфліктах, а також у мові та лексиці, яку використовує автор для опису її стану душі [Riskitya, Teguh, 2019]. Головна героїня роману «Beyond the blossoming fields» є прикладом іншого варіанту боротьби. Її боротьба - це прагнення стати лікарем у часи, коли жінкам було важко досягти професійного визнання. Цей роман демонструє зовнішню боротьбу за досягнення мрії та надзвичайну мотивацію головної героїні. Внутрішні монологи та роздуми Гінко допомагають читачеві зрозуміти її внутрішні конфлікти та рішучість [Sri Wirda and Purwarno, 2019]. Аналіз досліджень концепту БОРОТЬБА дозволяє з одного боку, зробити висновок про його універсальність, а з іншого – про різноманітність вираження в різних ситуаціях. Подальше вивчення особливостей репрезентації концепту в різних творах, в тому числі сучасних піснях, допоможе краще зрозуміти багатогранність цього явища.","completion":"ВИСНОВОК ДО РОЗДІЛУ 2 Актуальність концепту \\"боротьби\\" в сучасних наукових дослідженнях підкреслює його фундаментальну роль у конструюванні національних картин світу.

Аналіз концепту БОРОТЬБА англомовних перекладах романів «New Moon» Стефені Мейєр і «Beyond the blossoming fields» Юнічі Ватанабе розкриває особливості втілення цього концепту в аналізованих творах. В обох романах, боротьба стає ключовим мотивом і впливає на розвиток головних персонажів та сюжету. Обидва романи використовують символіку та образи, щоб підкреслити боротьбу героїв. Але на відміну від вище аналізованих досліджень, де представленні різні види боротьби, в цих романах головним складником концепту є боротьба особистісна. У романі «New Moon», символи, такі як місяць та сонце, відображають стан головної героїні. А у романі «Beyond the blossoming fields» образ молодого дерева підкреслює зростання Гінко як лікаря. Ці приклади свідчать про різноманітність та багатогранність концепту БОРОТЬБА. У романі «New Moon» дуже гарно описано внутрішню боротьбу головної героїні, яка змушена боротися не лише з вампірськими перешкодами, але й із власними прагненнями та емоціями. Ця боротьба відображається в її рішеннях та внутрішніх конфліктах, а також у мові та лексиці, яку використовує автор для опису її стану душі [Riskitya, Teguh, 2019]. Головна героїня роману «Beyond the blossoming fields» є прикладом іншого варіанту боротьби. Її боротьба - це прагнення стати лікарем у часи, коли жінкам було важко досягти професійного визнання. Цей роман демонструє зовнішню боротьбу за досягнення мрії та надзвичайну мотивацію головної героїні. Внутрішні монологи та роздуми Гінко допомагають читачеві зрозуміти її внутрішні конфлікти та рішучість [Sri Wirda and Purwarno, 2019]. Аналіз досліджень концепту БОРОТЬБА дозволяє з одного боку, зробити висновок про його універсальність, а з іншого – про різноманітність вираження в різних ситуаціях. Подальше вивчення особливостей репрезентації концепту в різних творах, в тому числі сучасних піснях, допоможе краще зрозуміти багатогранність цього явища.","completion":"ВИСНОВОК ДО РОЗДІЛУ 2 Сучасні дослідження підкреслюють значення концепту \\"боротьби\\" як важливого елемента національної картини світу, який має різні прояви – від політичної до особистісної боротьби. Концепт \\"боротьби\\" слугує потужним інструментом для розкриття глибинних культурних та індивідуальних цінностей через літературу та мову, демонструючи його універсальність і значення у різних фізичних, моральних, психологічних і соціокультурних контекстах. В творчості гурту \\"Twenty One Pilots\\", концепт \\"боротьби\\" займає центральне місце, оскільки сама концепція їх вигаданого світу Дема базується на зображенні боротьби звичайних людей проти опресивної влади дев'яти епіскопів. Це виражено через різні символічні засоби, такі як червоний колір, вогонь, мечі, квіти та іскри в поезії Лесі Українки, підкреслюючи багатозначність цього концепту та його здатність виражати широкий спектр людських дослідів та емоцій. Результати досліджень щодо вербалізації концепту \\"боротьби\\" в різних лінгвокультурних контекстах, як англомовних, так і у перекладах на українську мову, розкривають основні аспекти, семіотику та особливості вербалізації боротьби. Наприклад, аналіз художніх текстів з романів \\"New Moon\\" Стефені Мейєр та \\"Beyond the Blossoming Fields\\" Юнічі Ватанабе демонструє, як боротьба впливає на розвиток головних персонажів, спонукаючи до особистісного зростання та єднання зі своїми ідеалами та цінностями. Особливість і значущість концепту \\"боротьби\\" в сучасних гуманітарних дослідженнях підкреслюють його універсальність та специфічність в різних культурних та мовних традиціях, даючи підстави для подальших досліджень та аналізу.

Розглянемо кожен з них більш детально. Лексичні одиниці, що вказують на наслідки або обставини смерті, також містять додаткові аспекти, які можна детальніше розглянути: 1. Вбивство героя ворогом; 2. Вбивство ворога героєм. 1. Лексеми, метафори й образи, що вказують на факт смерті - використовуються для опису кінцевого стану життя, коли живий організм перестає функціонувати і більше не може виконувати життєві процеси. Ці терміни позначають фізичне припинення життя і є загальноприйнятими у різних культурах та мовах. Цей аспект репрезентований такими словами й словосполученнями: if and when I’d die; they would host and post a celebration; i’ll dissipate; can step off instead; you were one of those classic ones; you’re a legend in my own mind; then the day that it happened; no one ever comes back with details from beyond. Чи всі вони вказують на факт припинення життя? Розглянемо приклад: I could give up, and boost up my reputation I could go out with a bang They would know my name They would host and post a celebration «Neon Gravestones» У даному уривку тексту, концепт смерті пов’язаний з ідеєю відомих людей покинути світ яскраво і пам’ятно, подібно до героя кінофільму. Вони мріють про те, щоб їх смерть була помітною, щоб їх ім’я стало відомим, і щоб після їх смерті була проведена церемонія прощання, можливо, з великим святкуванням та увагою до них. Фраза they would host and post a celebration вказує на те, що люди мріють про те, щоб їх смерть стала важливою подією, яка викликає зацікавлення, шану та увагу. Концепт смерті тут пов’язаний з бажанням бути пам’ятним та вшанованим після відходу з життя. Розглянемо інший приклад: Alright You’re a legend in my own mind My middle name My goodbye «Legend» Ця пісня присвячена померлому дідусю автора пісень. Фраза you’re a legend in my own mind вказує на те, що автор має особливе ставлення до свого мертвого дідуся та вважає його надзвичайно важливою та видатною особистістю. Він може згадувати його як особистість, що залишила глибокий слід у його серці, і тому називає його «легендою у своїй голові». Образ смерті в даному контексті не є очевидним, але підтекстово відображається ставлення автора до мертвого дідуся, що може бути сприйняте як вшанування пам’яті померлої людини та надання їй особливого статусу в серці автора. Розглянемо ще один приклад: Time before they show me Why no one ever comes back With details from beyond «Leave the City» У цьому уривку тексту, концепт смерті пов’язаний з ідеєю загадковості та невідомості щодо того, що чекає людину після смерті. Автор обговорює питання життя після смерті та вказує на те, що ніхто, хто помер, не повертається назад, щоб розповісти подробиці з того, що відбувається після смерті. Концепт смерті тут пов’язаний з таємницею та неповіданою таємницею після життя. 2. Лексичні одиниці, що вказують на наслідки або обставини смерті включають слова й словосполучення feed me to the vultures; i’ll shred them all; i’ll grab my bat; i’ll bomb down on them; they’re calling for your head; if they’re here to smoke; i would get beat to smithereens; fire, Nico and the Niners; destroy it if I want; they know that it’s almost over; when it goes out it’s a glorious gone. Наприклад, дієслово shred описує фізичну дії, що призводить до смерті: «розривання» або «розчленування», при цьому ці дії спрямовані на захист себе та іншої особи від ворога: Surrounded and up against a wall I’ll shred ‘em all and go with you When choices end, you must defend I’ll grab my bat «My blood» Вираз I’ll grab my bat не містить прямої вказівки на смерть, однак контекстуально зрозуміло, що grab the bat описує засіб самозахисту або агресивну відповідь на небезпеку або загрозу, що з одного боку має запобігти смерті від рук іншої людини, а з іншого – вказує на можливу смерть нападника в результаті захисту. Лексичні одиниці, що вказують на наслідки або обставини смерті, репрезентують два напрями дії: 1. Вбивство героя ворогом; 2. Вбивство ворога героєм. Проаналізуємо їх детальніше. 1. Вбивство героя ворогом Цей складник представлений словосполученнями feed me to the vultures; they’re calling for your head; if they’re here to smoke; i would get beat to smithereens; they know that it’s almost over; when it goes out it’s a glorious gone. У цьому контексті герой зображується як жертва або потенційна жертва ворогів, і він відчуває небезпеку або загрозу свого життя. Вирази feed me to the vultures, they’re calling for your head та if they’re here to smoke підкреслюють небезпеку, яку створюють для героя вороги. Фрази i would get beat to smithereens та they know that it’s almost over говорять на те, що герой опинився в надзвичайно складній ситуації, де його можуть легко знищити. Загалом, герой зображується як такий, що перебуває в критичному становищі, його життя під загрозою, і вороги готові його знищити. Створюється відчуття страху, безпорадності та невпевненості перед майбутнім. Розглянемо приклад: People posted up at the end of your driveway They’re callin’ for your head and they’re callin’ for your name I’ll bomb down on ‘em, I’m comin’ through «My blood» У цьому куплеті концепт СМЕРТЬ представлено загрозливими образами і акцентами на насильницьких діях. В даному контексті фраза they’re callin’ for your head and they’re callin’ for your name означає, що є люди, які мають бажання побачити покарання героя, або ж побачити його мертвим. Вираз call for your head вказує на бажання агресивних дій, помсти або вбивства, можливо, в контексті ворожого ставлення до особи або через вчинені ними дії. В цілому, рядки передають напружену, небезпечну ситуацію, де смерть і насильство стають центральними темами. Розглянемо інший фрагмент: The burning Is so low it’s concerning ‘Cause they know that when it goes out It’s a glorious gone «Leave the City» У цьому уривку пісні смерть репрезентовано метафорами вогню і життя. Фраза the burning is so low it’s concerning може вказувати на втрату енергії або життєвої сили. Вогонь у даному випадку може бути асоційований з життям, і коли він погасне, це означатиме, що життєва енергія зникне. Фраза cause they know that when it goes out, it’s a glorious gone вказує на те, що коли життєва енергія або вогонь закінчується, це означає смерть, але смерть героя при цьому мислиться як щось величне (glorious). 2. Вбивство ворога героєм Складник представлений такими словосполученнями: i’ll shred them all; i’ll grab my bat; i’ll bomb down on them; fire, Nico and the Niners; destroy it if I want. У даному контексті, герой зображується як хтось, хто володіє великою силою, рішучістю та готовий вчинити насильство і знищити ворогів. Використані фрази i’ll shred them all, i’ll grab my bat, i’ll bomb down on them, fire, Nico and the Niners та destroy it if I want свідчать про агресивну і владну характеристику героя. Фрази i’ll shred them all, i’ll grab my bat, i’ll bomb down on them вказують на готовність героя атакувати своїх ворогів і вчиняти насильницькі дії. Загалом, герой в цьому контексті зображується як рішуча і заряджена енергією особа, яка стоїть на захисті або веде боротьбу з ворогами, навіть якщо це вимагає застосування насильства. Розглянемо приклад: I created this world To feel some control Destroy it if I want So I sing Sahlo Folina «Bandito» У цьому уривку смерть представлена опосередковно, у зв’язку з пов’язаний з ідеєю знищення світу чи контролю над ним. Рядки i created this world, to feel some control, destroy it if I want підкреслюють, що герой є творцем свого світу, має контроль над ним і може його знищити на свій розсуд. Це може бути символом смерті чи кінця, а також метафорою на позначення змін або перетворення. Фраза destroy it if I want може вказувати на потенційну готовність героя вжити рішучих дій, включаючи насильство, якщо виникає загроза. Оскільки увесь вигаданий світ Trench та місто Dema створено автором пісень, який асоціює себе з героєм, то він може знищити всіх дев’яти єпископів, якщо в нього виникне бажання. Загалом, смерть та насильство, що часто представлені метафорично, самі стають метаформи на позначення змін. 3. Терміни, що вказують на самогубство - самогубство - це акт навмисного припинення власного життя. Суїцид - це комплексне явище, і причини, які спонукають людину до такого кроку, можуть бути різноманітними та індивідуальними. Цей аспект репрезентований такими словами й словосполученнями: i’ll stop my plans; when I’d hear him mock me, that’s almost stopped me; sippin’ on straight chlorine; venom on my tongue; i decay; my body lives on lead; i could give up; neon gravestones try to call; if I lose to myself; save your razorblades now, not yet; rust around the rim drink it anyway I cut my lip; blood is on my tongue I cut my lip; i’m tired of tending to this fire. Розглянемо приклад: Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call) Neon gravestones try to call for my bones «Neon gravestones» У даному уривку тексту використовується метафора neon gravestones, яка символізує смерть. Метафора neon gravestones try to call for my bones може вказувати на спроби смерті або ідеї смерті (наприклад, думки про самогубство або самознищення) привернути увагу автора. Текст може висловлювати боротьбу зі своїми емоціями, страхами або підсвідомими думками про смерть або великий тиск, який суспільство чинить на людину. Розглянемо інший приклад: I’m tired Of tending to this fire I’ve used up all I’ve collected I have singed my hands It’s glowing «Leave the City» В даному уривку тексту виражено суїцидальні думки героя, який втомився від боротьби з життєвими викликами або проблемами, які постійно забирають сили (I’m tired оf tending to this fire). Метафора tending to this fire може символізувати постійні зусилля, які автор витрачає, щоб утримати своє життя (вогонь є символом життя), але відчуття втоми та перевантаження можуть вказувати на те, що герой вже не має сил продовжувати боротьбу. У контексті цих рядків, можна побачити, що герой перебуває в стані емоційної втоми, і можливо, розглядає суїцид як спосіб звільнитися від болю і стресу. Подивимось на ще один приклад: They want to make you forget Save your razorblades now, not yet Save your razorblades now, not yet «Nico and The Niners» У цьому уривку тексту фраза save your razorblades now, not yet може бути сприйнята як заклик сховати бритви і не здійснювати самогубство. Razorblades асоціюються зі здійсненням самогубства шляхом різання зап’ястя. Текст може намагатися донести повідомлення про важливість звернутися за допомогою і не здійснювати непередбачуваних та небезпечних дій. Загалом, дослідження використання лексем, що концептуалізують СМЕРТЬ у текстах пісень альбому, демонструє глибокий підхід автора до цієї теми. Відображаючи СМЕРТЬ через особистісні стосунки, боротьбу і внутрішні конфлікти, текстовий матеріал виходить за рамки простої тематики смерті, залучаючи слухачів до роздумів про значення життя, наслідки наших вчинків та пошук внутрішнього миру. напиши абзац ВИСНОВку ДО РОЗДІЛУ 3 за таким прикладом: концепт смерть реальзується у культурних, соціальних та політичних контекстах і представлений у мовній системі.

Через мовне втілення концепту в текстах пісень ми спостерігаємо, як смерть визначає ключові моменти людського існування, впливаючи на особистісні рефлексії та колективні уявлення. Це дослідження демонструє, що концепт \\"смерті\\", попри його універсальність в усіх культурах, знаходить унікальні форми вираження в контексті сучасної музичної культури та текстів пісень. Він не тільки репрезентує кінцевість життя та боротьбу із втратами, але й слугує засобом для дослідження глибинних психологічних та соціальних процесів, що відбуваються в суспільстві. Таким чином, концепт \\"смерті\\" в музиці \\"Twenty One Pilots\\" відкриває можливість для більш глибокого розуміння людських переживань, боротьби зі страхами та пошуку сенсу в реаліях непостійного та часто ворожого світу."},{"prompt":"Концепт СМЕРТЬ як об’єкт сучасних лінгвістичних досліджень Дослідження концепту СМЕРТЬ посідають важливе місце серед сучасних лінгвістичних досліджень концептів. Їхні результати свідчать про універсальність цього концепту, що є зрозумілим, адже всі люди смертні. З іншого боку, в різних культурах цей концепт виражений по-різному, зокрема з огляду на своєрідність сприйняття смерті, її емоційну та культурну значущість. Вивчення цього концепту допомагає розкрити, які образи та асоціації пов’язані зі смертю в різних мовах і культурах. Концепт СМЕРТЬ в українській лінгвокультурі розглянуто в різних аспектах: як аксіологічний символ у культурогенезі (Король, 2008), з огляду на його табуїзацію і використання евфемістичних висловів та фразеологізмів (Єловська, 2016), в контексті вербалізації як символа трагічних подій української історії у новелах Тютюнника Г. М. (Лихачова, 2017), образної репрезентації в ліричних творах (Суворова, 2014), репрезентації в українській когнітивно-мовній картині світу представників різних вікових груп українців (Федорюк, 2017, 2018), інтерпретації в українських пареміях (Собора, 2020) тощо. Репрезентацію концепту СМЕРТЬ також розглянуто на матеріалі поетичних текстів в іспанській лінгвокульурі (Настенко, 2006), паремійного фонду української та італійської мов (Близнюк, 2008), французької поезії епохи середньовіччя (Скрипник, 2005). Англомовний концепт СМЕРТЬ також неодноразорво ставав об’єктом лінгвістичних досліджень. Зокрема його розглянуто з огляду на вираження поняттєвих складників, структуру та семантичні ознаки (Давидова, 2023), дуалістичність лексико-семантичного поля на матеріалі англомовних лексикографічних джерел; (Могламова, 2019, 2020), особливості мовного втілення й метафоричної репрезентації в англомовній концептуальній картині світу, мовній і (Пуш, Гасюк, 2020; Панівська, Прийма, 2021). Аналізуючи різні аспекти концепту СМЕРТЬ, дослідники вивчають внутрішні аспекти смерті, такі як емоції, переживання та ставлення людей до ідеї смерті; зовнішні аспекти смерті, включаючи обряди, традиції, ритуали, пов’язані з смертю, та їхні відображення в мовленні; способи вираження концепту СМЕРТЬ мовними засобами, такими як метафори, символи, алегорії та інші лінгвістичні засоби. Художній англомовний концепт СМЕРТЬ також привертає увагу дослідників. Вивчено особливості його репрезентації в англомовних художніх творах і їх перекладах. Наприклад, у романі «Таємна історія» Донни Тартт, концепт СМЕРТЬ відтворюється через використання наукового стилю, де смерть розглядається як експеримент. Відчуженість та об’єктивність відображаються через наукові терміни та фрази, створюючи враження дослідження смерті як об’єкту. Український переклад зберігає цей стиль, з додатковими інформальними виразами для легшого сприйняття читачем [Масановець, 2021]. У романах В. Вульф та В. Моема концепт СМЕРТЬ розглядається через різні метафоричні концептуальні схеми. В романі Вульф «Місіс Делоуей» смерть сприймається як війна та насильство, а також як втрата і відчуженість. А в романі Моема «Розмальована вуаль» смерть розглядається як вічне життя та поштовх до змін. Ці метафоричні схеми допомагають осмислити складний концепт СМЕРТІ у художньому тексті [Заболотська, 2018]. Концепт СМЕРТЬ в англійській літературі жахів та її перекладах українською розглядає А. Раті. Автор підкреслює важливість точного відтворення всіх аспектів досліджуваного концепту в перекладі, включаючи описи тварин, фізичний стан тіла та воскресіння, а також вказує на успішні приклади та наголошує на важливості врахування всіх аспектів концепту СМЕРТЬ для збереження авторської інтенції в перекладі [Раті, 2014]. Дослідження концепту СМЕРТІ в українському та зарубіжному культурних просторах підкреслюють його важливість та універсальність для формування національної ідентичності і вказують на те, що смерть є не лише невід’ємною частиною життя, але й важливим складником культурного образу світу народу. Лексичні одиниці та метафори не лише відображають завершення життя, але й розкривають різні емоційні, культурні та філософські аспекти цього явища. Загалом, дослідження показують, що концепт СМЕРТЬ відображає культурні цінності та сприйняття життя та смерті у відповідних культурних середовищах. Подальше вивчення особливостей втілення концепту в різних творах, в тому числі сучасних піснях, допоможе краще зрозуміти сприйняття та розуміння смерті людиною. напиши абзац ВИСНОВку ДО РОЗДІЛУ 3 за таким прикладом: концепт смерть реальзується у культурних, соціальних та політичних контекстах і представлений у мовній системі.

Аналіз різних аспектів цього концепту - від аксіологічного символу до вербалізації у художніх творах та пареміях - відкриває різнобічний характер смерті, який водночас є динамічним у часі та стабільним у своєму культурному значенні. Особливу увагу дослідники приділяють способам мовної репрезентації смерті, що втілюють як загальнолюдські переживання, так і унікальні культурні особливості сприйняття кінцевості життя. Висвітлення концепту \\"смерті\\" у творчості різних епох і народів підтверджує його важливість для осмислення життєвого шляху, вічних питань буття та необхідності конфронтації з власними страхами та надіями.

Це дослідження наголошує на тому, що концепт \\"смерті\\" є не тільки неминучою частиною людського досвіду, але й ключовим елементом, що формує національну ідентичність, культурні цінності та світоглядні переконання різних народів. Отже, універсальність та різноманіття вираження концепту \\"смерті\\" у лінгвістичних дослідженнях підсилює його значення як інструменту культурного та мовного аналізу, збагачуючи наше розуміння людської природи і культурної різноманітності."}]`),G={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:I,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},W={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],B={key:0},q={key:1};function E(i,e,l,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",W,[(a(!0),o(w,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",L,' No results found for "'+h(n.searchQuery)+'".
