The Task: Can you give me a small comment like a redditor would comment for this reddit post and send it to me:\\"Gemini 1.5 will be ~20x cheaper than GPT4 - this is an existential threat to OpenAI From what we have seen so far Gemini 1.5 Pro is reasonably competitive with GPT4 in benchmarks, and the 1M context length and in-context learning abilities are astonishing. What hasn't been discussed much is pricing. Google hasn't announced specific number for 1.5 yet but we can make an educated projection based on [the paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf) and [pricing for 1.0 Pro](https://ai.google.dev/pricing). Google describes 1.5 as highly compute-efficient, in part due to the shift to a soft MoE architecture. I.e. only a small subset of the experts comprising the model need to be inferenced at a given time. This is a major improvement in efficiency from a dense model in Gemini 1.0. And though it doesn't specifically discuss architectural decisions for attention the paper mentions related work on deeply sub-quadratic attention mechanisms enabling long context (e.g. [Ring Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01889)) in discussing Gemini's achievement of 1-10M tokens. So we can infer that inference costs for long context are relatively manageable. And videos of prompts with ~1M context taking a minute to complete strongly suggest that this is the case barring Google throwing an entire TPU pod at inferencing an instance. Putting this together we can reasonably expect that pricing for 1.5 Pro should be similar to 1.0 Pro. Pricing for 1.0 Pro is 0.000125 / 1K characters. Compare that to 0.01 / 1K tokens for GPT4-Turbo. Rule of thumb is about 4 characters / token, so that's 0.0005 for 1.5 Pro vs 0.01 for GPT-4, or a 20x difference in Gemini's favor. So Google will be providing a model that is arguably superior to GPT4 overall at a price similar to GPT-3.5. If OpenAI isn't able to respond with a better and/or more efficient model soon Google will own the API market, and that is OpenAI's main revenue stream. https://ai.google.dev/pricing https://openai.com/pricing\\"","completion":"\`\`\`json { \\"command\\": { \\"name\\": \\"message_user\\", \\"args\\": { \\"message\\": \\"Wow, the price difference between Gemini 1.5 and GPT-4 is pretty wild!

Please go ahead and share their backgrounds, ideologies, territories, conflicts, and any other interesting details you have developed for your story."},{"prompt":"Btw, this world happens in a alternate timeline where Y2K ended the world.","completion":"That's an intriguing premise for your story! The Y2K bug, also known as the Millennium Bug, was a feared computer flaw that was supposed to cause massive disruptions at the turn of the millennium when computer systems would potentially fail to recognize the year 2000. Turning this concern into a reality that ends the world creates a unique setting for your post-apocalyptic factions. Please go ahead and tell me about these factions, how they've adapted to the world post-Y2K, and how the technological collapse has shaped their societies and conflicts."},{"prompt":"So, one faction is named the Desert Rangers. They are situated in the Western U.S. The Desert Rangers are based off of the NCR from the Fallout games. They use 1940s-1960s era weapons and equipment. Their two HQs are the Hoover Dam and Los Angeles. They commonly wear brown or tan fatigues with M1 helmets. They were established in 2001. The main areas that they govern are Washington, Oregon, California (alongside Baja and the Gulf of California), Utah, Arizona, Idaho and Montana.","completion":"The Desert Rangers sound like a formidable and well-structured faction within your post-apocalyptic world, drawing clear inspiration from the New California Republic (NCR) of the Fallout series. Here are some possible details and dynamics you might consider for the Desert Rangers: **Background and Development:** Given that your world diverged in the year 2000, it's interesting that the Desert Rangers were established shortly after the collapse. They might have formed from remnants of various military units, survivalist groups, or communities that banded together for mutual protection and to restore order in the chaos following the technological catastrophe. **Society and Ideology:** The Desert Rangers might advocate for the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, similar to the NCR. They could be working to rebuild society based on pre-Y2K American values, focusing on rebuilding infrastructure, promoting trade, and ensuring security for the territories they govern. **Military and Resources:** With headquarters at strategic locations like Hoover Dam and Los Angeles, the Desert Rangers undoubtedly have access to vital resources, including water and pre-Y2K military stockpiles and equipment. Their choice of 1940s-1960s era weapons and gear suggests a retrofitted approach to warfare, scavenging what works from the remnants of the old world. **Uniform and Appearance:** The use of brown or tan fatigues and M1 helmets not only provides a distinct visual identity for the Rangers but also indicates a reliance on reliable and well-known military equipment. This aesthetic could also serve to inspire a sense of nostalgia and legitimacy among the population, drawing on the iconic imagery of mid-20th-century American military forces. **Territory and Governance:** Their control over states such as Washington, Oregon, California, Utah, Arizona, Idaho, and Montana implies they govern a vast and diverse region with various challenges, from managing coastal areas to maintaining order in the desert and mountain territories. Their rule might vary from strict military governance in some areas to more autonomous local administration in others. **External Relations:** It would be interesting to explore the Desert Rangers' interactions with other factions. They might be engaged in trade, diplomacy, or conflict with neighboring groups. As they aim to expand their influence, they might encounter resistance from independent communities or rival factions with different visions for the future. **Internal Challenges:** The internal politics of the Desert Rangers could present their own challenges, with potential divisions between hardliners and reformers, disputes over resources, or debates on how to govern such a large and varied territory. As you develop your Desert Rangers further, consider how their origins, aspirations, and limitations shape their actions and how these, in turn, impact your story's larger narrative."},{"prompt":"Their leader kinda looks like Douglas MacArthur in terms of appearance. They have vehicles like tanks, jeeps, planes and trucks but they aren't used too much. They have a air force base in the Mojave desert. Their air force mostly consists of P-51s and a few Corsairs. Their tanks range from Shermans and Pattons. They have some bombers at their disposal, particularly like the A-26, B-17 and the B-29. They are at war with a faction called the Graybacks of which I'll talk about later.","completion":"The Desert Rangers' leader's resemblance to Douglas MacArthur brings to mind images of a strong, perhaps even authoritarian, military leader. This could hint at a faction that values discipline, hierarchy, and perhaps a certain degree of militarism—reflecting a longing for the 'great leaders' of the past to guide them through the chaos of the post-apocalyptic world. **Leadership and Image:** The choice to model the leader after a historical military figure like MacArthur could indicate a central personality around which the faction unites. Such a figure might be seen as a stabilizing force, a strategic genius, or even a symbol of a bygone era. This could also point to a cult of personality, with the leader's image being used for propaganda purposes to instill loyalty among the troops and civilians. **Military Might and Logistics:** The Desert Rangers' possession of vintage military vehicles like tanks, jeeps, planes, and trucks underscores their resourcefulness and strategic advantage. However, the fact that these vehicles aren't used much could imply a variety of things: scarcity of fuel or parts, the strategic choice to conserve them for critical battles, or perhaps a prioritization of ground forces and fortifications. **Air Force Capabilities:** Having a functional air force, even if it primarily consists of P-51 Mustangs and Vought F4U Corsairs, gives the Desert Rangers a significant edge in reconnaissance, mobility, and combat. Their bombers, including the A-26 Invader, B-17 Flying Fortress, and B-29 Superfortress, would be incredible assets for strategic bombings or displays of power, despite the logistical challenges of maintaining such complex, vintage aircraft. **Tanks:** Using iconic tanks like the M4 Sherman and M48 Patton further cements the Desert Rangers' image as a faction deeply rooted in mid-20th-century military tradition. These tanks would be powerful tools on the battlefield, though their maintenance and operational costs in a post-apocalyptic world would likely be considerable. **Conflict with the Graybacks:** The ongoing war with the Graybacks suggests that the Desert Rangers have a formidable opponent, challenging their control and ideology. This conflict could be the central narrative driver of your story, with battles, espionage, and shifting front lines offering constant tension and drama. The reasons for the war, whether ideological, territorial, or resource-driven, will add depth to the narrative and give insight into the motivations of both factions. **Considerations:** As you flesh out the Desert Rangers even further, consider how they maintain their vehicle fleets and where they get the parts, fuel, and expertise required to keep such vintage equipment operational. Additionally, think about how the war with the Graybacks influences internal faction dynamics and the leader's position. I'm looking forward to hearing more about the Graybacks and how they contrast with the Desert Rangers in your narrative."},{"prompt":"Their leader used to be a U.S. army general. He was known to visit troops on the frontline and often carried a single action revolver. He also often wore brown-tinted shades. He once said that he will not send any young Americans to die in another U.S. state unless he really has to, meaning that he wouldn't start a war just because he feels like it. So, up until 2005, the Desert Rangers were busy either helping civilians, patrolling around the wasteland or just doing nothing. Their flag is a black field with three horizontal yellow stripes alongside a white star.","completion":"The Desert Rangers' leader, formerly a U.S. army general, clearly embodies a strong and charismatic figure, with his commitment to being on the front lines and that iconic carry of a single-action revolver, reminiscent of storied military leaders of the past. His use of brown-tinted shades could also serve as a distinctive visual trademark that enhances his mythos among the people and his troops. **Leadership Philosophy:** His statement about not sending young Americans to die in another U.S. state unless necessary depicts him as a pragmatic and potentially empathetic leader. It suggests a reluctance to enter into conflict without just cause, which could be a point of respect within the faction, or a source of tension if there are those among his ranks who are more hawkish and eager for expansion or retribution. **Peace-Time Actions:** It's interesting to note that the Desert Rangers spent the first five years after the apocalypse not waging war but instead focusing on civilian aid, patrolling, and staying idle when appropriate. This approach to post-apocalyptic governance indicates a faction prioritizing stabilization and protection over conquest, at least initially. Their activities during this time would have helped them build legitimacy and trust with survivors, as well as establish a degree of order and safety in the lands they control. **The Flag:** Their flag's design, a black field with three horizontal yellow stripes and a white star, combines simplicity with strong symbolism. The color choice and the imagery might represent various traits or historical references: - Black backgrounds often symbolize strength, determination, and the hardships overcome. - The yellow stripes could represent the faction's commitment to a prosperous future, illumination in dark times, or a connection to wealth in terms of resources or spirit. - The white star might symbolize guidance, a bright future, or possibly the leader himself as a guiding star for the faction. The symbolism of the flag could play a significant role in how the faction and its members perceive themselves and how they present themselves to others in the wasteland. As you continue to develop this faction and its leader, consider how their background, values, and actions have shaped their evolution, their interactions with other factions, and their current challenges and ambitions. The dynamic between the leader's philosophy, the faction's militaristic capabilities, and their relations with the people will likely be central to your story. Given the leader's cautious stance on warfare, it will be fascinating to uncover the circumstances that led to the conflict with the Graybacks—the opposing faction you plan to discuss later."},{"prompt":"Ok, time to talk about the Graybacks. They are kind of based off of Caesar's Legion from Fallout New Vegas. They own Texas, Louisiana and a large part of the Southern U.S. Their vehicles are mainly horse carriages, pick-up trucks and even crudely-made tanks made out of Bulldozers. Their ideology is similar to that of the CSA. They wear gray uniforms, British brodie helmets and mostly WW2 gear. They are at war with the Desert Rangers since 2005.","completion":"The Graybacks present a stark contrast to the more technologically geared and structured Desert Rangers. Inspired by Caesar's Legion from Fallout: New Vegas, with a taste of the historical Confederacy, the Graybacks sound like a faction with a fierce and possibly aggressive ideology. **Geographical Territory:** Owning Texas, Louisiana, and a large part of the Southern U.S. would offer the Graybacks significant agricultural resources and access to oil reserves, both of which would be extremely valuable in a post-apocalyptic world. Control over these resources could be a major point of contention and might be one reason behind their war with the Desert Rangers. **Vehicles and Technology:** The Graybacks' use of horse carriages, pick-up trucks, and makeshift tanks suggests a more rudimentary level of industrial capability compared to the Desert Rangers. However, such vehicles would likely require less maintenance and could be easier to fuel and produce, giving the Graybacks the advantage of mobility and adaptability. **Ideology:** If their ideology mirrors that of the historically secessionist and slavery-based Confederate States of America (CSA), they may espouse a rigid social hierarchy, potentially enslaving some populations or enforcing strict social controls. Such an ideology could also lead to a powerful central leadership, loyalty to the cause, and an expansionist mindset, setting them up for inevitable conflict with neighboring factions, particularly one as differently structured as the Desert Rangers. **Uniforms and Gear:** Gray uniforms paired with British Brodie helmets add a distinctive old-world military aesthetic to the Graybacks. It offers a visual reminder of their ideological grounding, perhaps meant to invoke both the historical CSA and the tough, disciplined image of early 20th-century armies. **Conflict with the Desert Rangers:** The war with the Desert Rangers that began in 2005 would likely be a significant driving force in your story. This conflict could be over ideology, control of vital resources, territory, or a clash of expansionist ambitions. Given their ideological roots, the Graybacks might view the Desert Rangers' governance style and territory as a threat to their way of life or as lands that rightfully belong to them. As you develop the Graybacks: Consider how their social structure and economy function, particularly if it resembles the CSA—the complexities of maintaining their system and the internal and external challenges they face. Think about the nature of their leadership—is there a single charismatic figure like the Desert Rangers' general, or is their leadership more diffuse? Explore how they carry out warfare with less advanced technology, which might involve guerrilla tactics, resourcefulness, or leveraging their knowledge of the land. Delve into the cultural aspects that bolster their unity, potentially including rituals, education, propaganda, or interpretations of history. Understanding the Graybacks will provide depth to the world you're creating, as they represent not just an opposing force to the Desert Rangers but also a different vision of what society could be in the aftermath of a global catastrophe."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Bauble","completion":"\\"Bauble Bliss | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Gift Idea | Modern Decor | Customizable Illustration\\""},{"prompt":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Bauble Bliss | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Gift Idea | Modern Decor | Customizable Illustration.

Главная цель переезда — обеспечение безопасного и эффективного перемещения людей и транспортных средств через железнодорожные пути. Железнодорожные переезды могут быть оборудованы различными системами сигнализации и защиты для предотвращения аварий: 1. Светофорное регулирование: сигналы светофора сообщают водителям и пешеходам о приближении поезда. 2. Шлагбаумы: барьеры, которые опускаются, чтобы блокировать проезд при приближении поезда. 3. Звуковая сигнализация: звуковые сигналы, которые активируются при приближении поезда. 4. Автоматические предупредительные системы: системы, интегрированные с дорожным движением, чтобы предупреждать о приближении поезда. Основные проблемы, связанные с железнодорожными переездами, включают: - Риск столкновений между поездами и транспортными средствами или пешеходами. - Задержки дорожного движения из-за закрытия переезда для проезда поезда. - Необходимость постоянного обслуживания и модернизации сигнализационных систем для обеспечения безопасности. Меры по повышению безопасности на железнодорожных переездах включают: - Повышение осведомленности водителей и пешеходов о правилах поведения на переездах. - Улучшение технологий сигнализации и контроля за их эффективностью. - Реализация программ удаления или модернизации опасных переездов. - Замена железнодорожных переездов мостами и тоннелями там, где это возможно и экономически оправдано."},{"prompt":"Reply to this message and mention my name Walid: Good morning, My name is Lee.

Ресурсы, такие как земля, труд, капитал и предпринимательство, ограничены, тогда как желания и потребности человека кажутся безграничными. Это основополагающее экономическое напряжение создает проблему выбора — как и что производить, как распределять и на что потреблять. В данном реферате рассматривается, как эта проблема проявляется в экономической теории и практике через концепции кривой производственных возможностей и альтернативных издержек. 1. Безграничность потребностей и ограниченность ресурсов Человеческие потребности могут быть разделены на основные (еда, вода, жилье) и вторичные (образование, отдых, технологии). В современном обществе появляются все новые потребности, стимулируемые технологическим прогрессом, изменениями в образе жизни и рекламой. При этом количество и качество доступных ресурсов ограничено, их не хватает для удовлетворения всех желаний людей. 2. Проблема выбора Проблема выбора возникает из-за несоответствий между ограниченными ресурсами и неограниченными потребностями. Индивидам, компаниям и обществам приходится принимать решения о том, как лучше использовать свои ресурсы. Эти решения основаны на приоритетах и целях, которые могут быть обоснованными экономической выгодой, социальным положением, культурными ценностями или политическими устремлениями. 3. Кривая производственных возможностей (КПВ) КПВ — это графическое отображение максимально возможных комбинаций двух товаров или услуг, которые можно произвести при полном и эффективном использовании всех доступных ресурсов. Точки на кривой показывают альтернативные варианты производства, между которыми экономика должна выбирать. Точки под кривой означают неэффективное использование ресурсов, в то время как точки за пределами кривой недостижимы при текущих ресурсах. 4. Альтернативные издержки Выбор между различными вариантами использования ресурсов влечет за собой понятие альтернативных издержек, которое отражает стоимость упущенных возможностей. Альтернативные издержки — это ценность следующей лучшей альтернативы, от которой пришлось отказаться в пользу принятого решения. Этот концепт помогает оценить реальную стоимость экономических решений. Заключение Проблема выбора, с которой сталкиваются экономические агенты, является центральной в экономической теории и практике. Процесс принятия решений требует понимания альтернативных издержек и оценки возможных исходов. Кривая производственных возможностей служит инструментом для визуализации этого процесса и демонстрации ограничений, с которыми сталкиваются производители. Осознание безграничности потребностей и ограниченности ресурсов имеет важное значение для обеспечения устойчивого развития и благосостояния общества."},{"prompt":"Reply to this message : Nice to hear from you Walid!

It is one of the three main goals of information security, commonly referred to as the CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. When assessing risk to information security, availability is considered alongside the potential impacts that incidents such as system failures, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions can have on the accessibility of systems and data. A risk assessment would evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of such events on the availability of essential services and information. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, threats, and the potential for unwanted events that could compromise availability, and then to implement measures to mitigate those risks. Measures to ensure availability often include: 1. Redundancy: Having multiple instances of critical components or systems, so if one fails, others can take over. 2. Fault tolerance: Designing systems to continue functioning properly in the event of the failure of some of its components. 3. Disaster recovery plans: Establishing procedures for restoring systems and data after a disaster. 4. Business continuity planning: Strategies to ensure that essential functions can continue during and after a significant disruption. 5. Regular maintenance: Ensuring that systems are updated and maintained to prevent failures due to outdated or degraded components. 6. Network infrastructure: Ensuring sufficient bandwidth and optimal network configuration to handle required traffic and prevent bottlenecks. Assessing the risk to availability helps organizations prioritize resources, implement appropriate security controls, and develop response and recovery strategies to ensure continuous operation and minimize downtime in case of incidents."},{"prompt":"what does integrity mean in risk assessment","completion":"In risk assessment, particularly within the realm of information security, integrity refers to the trustworthiness, accuracy, and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle. It ensures that information is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized individuals or processes, and that it remains in its intended state, free from unauthorized or inadvertent modification. Risk assessment concerning data integrity involves: 1. **Identifying Critical Data**: Recognizing which data is vital to the organization's operations and requires protection to maintain its integrity. 2. **Threat Identification**: Determining the potential threats that could compromise the integrity of the data. These threats could include cyberattacks such as malware, hacking, or insider threats leading to intentional data tampering, as well as unintentional threats such as user error or system malfunctions. 3. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Evaluating weaknesses that could be exploited to compromise data integrity, such as lack of data validation, inadequate access controls, or absence of audit trails. 4. **Impact Assessment**: Understanding the consequences of integrity breaches on the organization’s operations, reputation, regulatory compliance, and financial status. Different types of data have differing impacts if their integrity is compromised, and knowing this helps prioritize risk management efforts. 5. **Control Implementation**: Deploying measures to safeguard data integrity. These can include cryptographic controls for protecting data in transit, access controls to prevent unauthorized data modification, input validation techniques to ensure accurate data entry, and version controls to track changes over time. 6. **Monitoring and Response**: Establishing systems to monitor data for integrity issues and to respond rapidly if integrity is compromised. This might involve using intrusion detection systems, implementing file integrity monitoring tools, or employing security information and event management (SIEM) systems. 7. **Review and Auditing**: Regularly auditing data and systems for integrity to ensure that controls are effective and to make updates as necessary based on changing risks. Ensuring the integrity of information is critical for decision-making, legal and regulatory compliance, and maintaining trust between business entities and customers. Risk assessments related to integrity help organizations protect against data corruption and maintain data quality and reliability, which is essential for operational effectiveness and preserving an organization’s reputation."},{"prompt":"what is the risk treatment for desktop for a company like ancestry, please indicate using only: avoid, transfer, reduce, accept","completion":"When managing risks to desktop environments for a company like Ancestry, which deals with sensitive customer data including personal and genetic information, it's essential to apply appropriate risk treatment strategies. Here are typical ways to address these risks using the four primary risk treatment options: Avoid, Transfer, Reduce, and Accept. 1. **Avoid**: To avoid risks, a company may decide not to engage in certain activities that are deemed too risky. For desktops, avoidance could include not storing sensitive data locally on desktop machines or choosing not to use desktops at all for certain activities that involve processing highly sensitive information. 2. **Transfer**: Risk transfer involves shifting the risk to another party. This could be achieved by purchasing insurance policies specific to cyber threats, or by outsourcing certain IT operations to specialized firms that assume responsibility for managing associated risks. For desktops, this could also mean using leased hardware where the leasing company is responsible for its maintenance and disposal, thereby transferring some of the associated risks. 3. **Reduce**: Risk reduction is about implementing controls to lessen the likelihood and/or impact of a risk event. For desktops, this would involve a range of measures: - Implementing and enforcing strong cybersecurity policies (e.g., use of antivirus and antimalware software, firewalls, regular updates and patches). - User training and awareness programs to reduce the risk of human error or phishing attacks. - Encrypting hard drives to protect data in case of theft or loss. - Physical security controls to prevent unauthorized access to premises and thereby to desktops. - Regular backup procedures to mitigate the risk of data loss. 4. **Accept**: Risk acceptance means that the company acknowledges the risk and decides to accept it, usually because the cost of other risk treatments is greater than the benefit they would provide. It could include accepting the risk of keeping non-critical data on desktops or acknowledging that certain low-impact threats are not worth mitigating due to resource constraints. Typically, when a risk is accepted, it is because it falls below the organization's risk appetite threshold. For a company like Ancestry, where data integrity and protection are crucial, the focus would likely be on risk avoidance, transfer, and reduction strategies for desktop risk management. Risk acceptance might be applied only in cases where the risk level is considered negligible in comparison to the overall operational context. It is also essential for companies to continually reassess their risk landscape and adjust their risk treatment plans as necessary."},{"prompt":"I have a function that has a certain type in React.

However, I can offer some general reasons why it may seem like YouTube is not responding to your report: 1. **Volume of Reports**: YouTube receives a vast number of reports every day. Due to this high volume, it may take time for them to address your specific report, or it might not be prioritized based upon their criteria. 2. **Review Process**: YouTube uses both automated systems and human reviewers to check reported content. Your report might still be in the queue waiting for review, or it might have been reviewed and deemed not to violate YouTube's policies. 3. **Policy Enforcement**: YouTube has community guidelines and policies that outline what is considered a violation. If the content doesn't clearly violate these policies, they might not take action. Sometimes what one person finds offensive or problematic may not necessarily breach YouTube's guidelines. 4. **Lack of Evidence**: If the report you filed doesn't provide sufficient evidence or detail, YouTube might not be able to take action. It's important to be clear and specific in your reporting. 5. **Automated Responses**: YouTube often relies on automated systems to handle initial reports which might miss nuances or require further context that a human reviewer would understand. 6. **Non-visible Action**: In some cases, YouTube might take action that isn't visible to you. For example, they might limit the visibility of certain content, demonetize it, or provide warnings without outright removal. If you believe that the content you reported seriously violates YouTube's policies and poses a risk, you can try to report it again, making sure to provide as much detail and evidence as possible. Additionally, for issues that are not being satisfactorily resolved, you could try reaching out to YouTube through their official social media channels or support for a more direct line of communication."},{"prompt":"translate it to polish","completion":"Nie jest możliwe, abym znał konkrety dotyczące tego, dlaczego YouTube mógłby ignorować twoje zgłoszenie bez dodatkowego kontekstu. Jednakże mogę podać kilka ogólnych przyczyn, dla których może się wydawać, że YouTube nie odpowiada na twoje zgłoszenie: 1. **Ilość Zgłoszeń**: YouTube otrzymuje ogromną liczbę zgłoszeń każdego dnia. Z powodu tej dużej ilości zgłoszeń, może zająć im trochę czasu, zanim zajmą się twoim konkretnym zgłoszeniem, lub może ono nie zostać uznane za priorytetowe w oparciu o ich kryteria. 2. **Proces Przeglądu**: YouTube wykorzystuje zarówno systemy automatyczne, jak i recenzentów ludzkich do sprawdzania zgłaszanego contentu. Twoje zgłoszenie może wciąż czekać w kolejce na przegląd, lub mogło zostać już przejrzane i uznane, że nie narusza ono polityki YouTube. 3. **Egzekwowanie Polityki**: YouTube posiada wytyczne dotyczące społeczności i polityki określające, co jest uznawane za naruszenie. Jeśli content nie narusza wyraźnie tych wytycznych, mogą nie podjąć działania. Czasami to, co jedna osoba uważa za obraźliwe lub problematyczne, może niekoniecznie naruszać wytyczne YouTube. 4. **Brak Dowodów**: Jeżeli zgłoszenie, które złożyłeś, nie dostarcza wystarczających dowodów lub szczegółów, YouTube może nie być w stanie podjąć działania. Ważne jest, aby być jasnym i konkretnym w swoim zgłoszeniu. 5. **Automatyczne Odpowiedzi**: YouTube często polega na systemach automatycznych do obsługi wstępnych zgłoszeń, które mogą przeoczyć niuanse lub wymagać dodatkowego kontekstu, który zrozumiałby recenzent ludzki. 6. **Działanie Niewidoczne dla Użytkownika**: W niektórych przypadkach YouTube może podjąć działanie, które nie jest widoczne dla ciebie. Na przykład, mogą ograniczyć widoczność pewnych treści, demonetyzować je, lub dostarczać ostrzeżenia bez całkowitego usunięcia. Jeśli uważasz, że treść, którą zgłosiłeś, poważnie narusza zasady YouTube i stanowi ryzyko, możesz spróbować zgłosić to ponownie, upewniając się, że dostarczasz jak najwięcej szczegółów i dowodów. Dodatkowo, dla problemów, które nie są rozwiązywane w satysfakcjonujący sposób, możesz spróbować skontaktować się z YouTube poprzez ich oficjalne kanały w mediach społecznościowych lub wsparcie, aby uzyskać bardziej bezpośrednią linię komunikacji."},{"prompt":"Generaly the context is that I'm sended so much reports which is no worked (because I didn't know how to make report) is this reason of that my reports are ignored?","completion":"Tak, jeśli wysłałeś dużą liczbę zgłoszeń, które nie były poprawnie sformułowane lub nie zawierały wystarczających informacji, to może to być jeden z powodów, dla których YouTube mógł je zignorować. Oto kilka potencjalnych czynników, które mogą mieć wpływ na to, jak YouTube traktuje zgłoszenia: 1. **Jakość Zgłoszeń**: Jeśli zgłoszenia, które składasz, są niespecyficzne, niejasne lub nie zawierają konkretnych przykładów naruszeń, mają mniejszą szansę na przyciągnięcie uwagi i być może nie zostaną przyjęte do działania. 2. **Spamowanie Zgłoszeniami**: Wysyłanie dużej ilości zgłoszeń o niskiej jakości może być postrzegane jako spam, co może spowodować, że system YouTube automatycznie będzie je traktował z mniejszą powagą lub nawet ograniczy zdolność twojego konta do zgłaszania. 3. **Nauczenie Systemu**: Systemy sztucznej inteligencji i filtrowania używane przez YouTube mogą \\"uczyć się\\" z poprzednich zgłoszeń i jeśli wielokrotnie nie stwierdzają one naruszeń, mogą to wpłynąć na to, jak przyszłe zgłoszenia są przetwarzane. Aby uniknąć ignorowania twoich zgłoszeń, upewnij się, że są one jak najbardziej precyzyjne i zgodne z wytycznymi YouTube dotyczącymi zgłaszania treści. Oto kilka wskazówek, jak skuteczniej zgłaszać treści: - **Dokładność**: Podaj jak najwięcej szczegółów dotyczących naruszenia, w tym konkretnych czasów (minuty i sekundy), gdy naruszenia występują w wideo, jeśli to możliwe. - **Zgodność z Wytycznymi**: Upewnij się, że treść, którą zgłaszasz, faktycznie narusza wytyczne dotyczące społeczności YouTube. Przeczytaj i zrozum te wytyczne, aby zgłaszać tylko te treści, które je łamią. - **Opis Kontekstu**: Dostarcz kontekst i wyjaśnienia, dlaczego uważasz, że dana treść narusza wytyczne YouTube. Jeśli poprawisz jakość swoich zgłoszeń i będziesz przestrzegać tych wskazówek, masz szansę, że Twoje przyszłe raporty będą traktowane poważniej."},{"prompt":"Am I need to change account to not beign ignored?","completion":"If you've been consistently submitting reports that do not adhere to YouTube's reporting guidelines or lack sufficient information, it could potentially impact the platform's responsiveness to your future reports. If YouTube's systems flag your account as one that frequently submits low-quality or inaccurate reports, they might deprioritize or automate responses to your submissions. However, here are some actions you can take before considering creating a new account: 1. **Improve Report Quality**: Make sure you only report content that clearly violates YouTube's Community Guidelines. Provide detailed information in your reports to help reviewers understand the issue. 2. **Review Community Guidelines**: Familiarize yourself with what YouTube considers to be a violation. Understanding these rules can ensure that you only report content that actually breaches these guidelines. 3. **Be Patient**: After making a report with accurate information and clear justification, give YouTube some time to process it. Reviewing reports can take time, especially if there's a high volume of reports to sift through. 4. **Use Alternate Reporting Methods**: If there's an urgent or severe issue and your previous reports seem to be ignored, you might consider reaching out to YouTube through other channels, such as their official Twitter support account. Creating a new account should be a last resort, and keep in mind that creating multiple accounts for the purpose of bypassing restrictions or penalties is against YouTube's policies and can lead to further action against your accounts. Instead, focus on enhancing the quality of your communication with YouTube and ensure that each report you make is valid and well-documented. This will improve the likelihood of your reports being acted upon and reduce the chance of them being disregarded as spam or noise. Remember that YouTube has to balance the need to review reports with the freedom of expression and the sheer scale of content hosted on their platform, which can complicate the moderation process."},{"prompt":"translate it to Polish","completion":"Jeśli systematycznie wysyłałeś zgłoszenia, które nie przestrzegają wytycznych YouTube dotyczących raportowania, lub brakowało im wystarczających informacji, mogło to wpłynąć na reakcję platformy na Twoje przyszłe raporty. Jeśli systemy YouTube oznaczą Twoje konto jako takie, które często składa zgłoszenia niskiej jakości lub nieprecyzyjne, mogą one zepchnąć na niższy priorytet lub automatyzować odpowiedzi na Twoje zgłoszenia. Jednak przed rozważeniem utworzenia nowego konta, oto kilka działań, które możesz podjąć: 1. **Poprawa Jakości Zgłoszeń**: Upewnij się, że zgłaszasz tylko treści, które wyraźnie naruszają Wytyczne Społeczności YouTube. Dostarczaj szczegółowych informacji w swoich raportach, aby pomóc recenzentom zrozumieć problem. 2. **Przejrzyj Wytyczne Społeczności**: Zapoznaj się z tym, co YouTube uważa za naruszenie. Zrozumienie tych zasad może sprawić, że będziesz zgłaszał tylko treści, które faktycznie naruszają te wytyczne. 3. **Bądź Cierpliwy**: Po dokonaniu zgłoszenia z dokładnymi informacjami i jasnym uzasadnieniem, daj YouTube trochę czasu na jego przetworzenie. Przeglądanie zgłoszeń może zająć czas, szczególnie gdy jest duża liczba zgłoszeń do przeanalizowania. 4. **Skorzystaj z Alternatywnych Metod Zgłaszania**: Jeśli jest pilna lub poważna sprawa i Twoje poprzednie zgłoszenia wydają się być ignorowane, możesz spróbować skontaktować się z YouTube poprzez inne kanały, takie jak ich oficjalne konto wsparcia na Twitterze. Stworzenie nowego konta powinno być ostatecznością, i pamiętaj, że tworzenie wielu kont w celu obejścia ograniczeń lub kar jest sprzeczne z polityką YouTube i może prowadzić do dalszych działań przeciwko Twoim kontom. Zamiast tego, skup się na poprawie jakości Twojej komunikacji z YouTube i upewnij się, że każde zgłoszenie, które składasz, jest ważne i dobrze udokumentowane. To zwiększy prawdopodobieństwo podjęcia działań w odniesieniu do Twoich raportów i zmniejszy szansę, że zostaną one zignorowane jako spam lub tylko szum informacyjny.

MNS 엔터 역시 다르지 않았다. 그러나 이번 회의는 시간이 늦었음에도 주요 임직원들이 퇴근을 못 할 만큼 중요했다. 분기 회의였기 때문이다. 일과 시간엔 언론 대응으로 바빠 이제야 할 수 있었다. 먼저 프로듀싱 본부의 제작팀장이 정리된 플랜을 발표했다. “지안 씨 송캠프가 이달 말로 확정됐습니다.” MNS 엔터의 중요 행사 중 하나다. 송캠프. 국내, 해외의 유명 작곡가들이 참가해 협력해서 곡 작업을 하는 자리. 십수 년 전까지만 해도 단독 또는 많아야 작곡가가 2~3명이 보편적이었으나, 그 후론 명단에 10명씩 들어가는 것도 흔해졌다. 송캠프에서 곡이 완성된 경우가 그렇다. 그러자 김덕구 전무가 정우담이 했던 말을 알렸다. “우담 씨가 전에 송캠프 참여해보고 싶다고 했었죠.” 대표도 긍정적이었다. “지안이 다음 타이틀에 바로 우담 씨 활동명을 넣긴 힘들겠지만, 지안이 곡만 만들어지는 건 아니니 그날 시간 된다면 안내해주세요.” 명분은 서지안의 앨범이다. 그래도 작곡가가 많이 오는 행사라 넘쳐나게 곡이 나온다. 그중 몇 개는 MNS 소속의 다른 아티스트에게 가거나 퍼블리싱으로 들어간다. 무엇보다, 정우담이 협업에 적극적인 게 놀랍다. 그 협업이 송캠프 한정일지, 타 아티스트와의 콜라보레이션에도 작용할지는 아직 모르겠지만, 좋은 현상으로 보였다. ‘이미 우담 씨와 콜라보를 하고 싶다는 사람도 있고.’ 대형기획사 소속의 보이그룹, 체인어스의 멤버도 소속사를 통해 연락이 왔었다. 체인어스 대 정우담의 콜라보레이션이 아닌, 청음회에 왔던 작곡 멤버의 개인 활동용 앨범을 기획 중이라고 한다. 단지 정우담이 정신없는 한때를 보내고 있으니, 음악방송이라도 마무리되면 알려주려 아직 소식을 전하지 않았다. 어쩌다 보니 서지안의 컴백 곡 수급을 위한 발표에서 정우담이 화두가 되고 말았다. “계속하시죠.” “네, 대표님. 에이트레블도 이달 말부터 완전체 포토와 티저, 컨텐츠가 공개됩니다. 다음 달 열릴 데뷔 쇼케이스는 2천석 규모의 홀을 대관해놨고.” MNS 엔터의 첫 아이돌 그룹이 마침내 데뷔한다는 이야기였고, 시간순으로 나열하다 보니 다시 소속 아티스트들 컴백 관련으로 이어졌다. 하지만 마지막에는 또 정우담이다. “그리고 신채윤 씨를 메인으로 데뷔시킬 보컬 그룹에, 다빈이도 발탁되었습니다. 우담 씨는 3인조를 구상하고 있습니다.” 대표는 이 구성이 무엇을 의미하는지 알았다. ‘MNS 엔터에서 데뷔시키려면 지안이의 색을 완전히 뺄 순 없으니.’ 김다빈은 MNS 엔터와 정우담의 트레이닝을 함께 받아왔다. 월말 평가에서도 실력이 대단히 향상되었다는 보고를 받았다. 그러니 완벽하게 외부인이었던 신채윤과, 서지안에게 영향을 많이 받았을 나머지 멤버 사이를 이어주는 교두보로 김다빈이 낙점된 것이다. 그라데이션, 중화제 역할을 맡겼단 뜻이다. 전무가 물었다. “3인조면, 마지막은 누구예요?” “우담 씨도 고민되는 것 같습니다. 좀 더 지켜보고 결정하겠대요. 나이가 너무 어리고, 걸그룹 프로젝트 연습생이거든요.” “몇 살이길래?” “17살이요. 다빈이가 22살이고 채윤 씨가 24살이니까 나이 차가.” 꽤 난다. 보컬 그룹은 돌발 플랜인 반면, 댄스 퍼포먼스형 걸그룹은 보이그룹 다음으로 짜오던 플랜. 내후년에 데뷔시킬 계획이니 어린 게 당연했다. “그래도 우담 씨가 그 친구를 눈여겨보는 이유가 있겠죠. 솔로 쪽도 계속 런칭 준비해주시고요.” “알겠습니다.” 데뷔해도 되겠다 싶을 때가 되면 알려주는 거라 아직 연습생들은 모르겠지만, MNS 엔터는 올해부터 1년에 두 팀씩 데뷔시키려 한다. 비단 그룹만 말하는 게 아닌 솔로도 포함. 원래부터 아티스트 늘리기에 박차를 가해오고 있었는데, 정우담이 가세하며 속력이 붙은 것이다. 양질의 곡이 쌓여간다면, 최대한 내부에서 소화하는 편이 MNS 엔터나 정우담이나 좋기 때문이다. 수입 면에서 압도적으로 차이가 나니까. 심지어 전무는 이런 생각까지 하고 있었다. ‘조만간 우담 씨도 이 분기 회의에 참석하시는 거 아니야?’ 아티스트인데 아티스트로만 둘 수 없는 인물. 나중엔 MNS 엔터 사외이사 명함도 들고 다니는 건 아닐지, 쿡쿡 웃음이 났다. 그만큼 더는 MNS 엔터엔 없어선 안 될 전략적 파트너가 되어버렸다. *** 사실 정우담은 ‘비주얼 튜너’ 안경 덕에 보컬 그룹의 빠른 선별이 가능했다. 악기뿐만 아니라 보컬리스트까지 보는 것만으로 필요한 튜닝을 알려주는 유니크 아이템. 컨디션이 퍼센티지로 표시된다. 여자 연습생이 30명 정도였는데, 노래 한 곡을 다 들어보지 않아도 됐다. 한 사람당 1분씩 주어졌다. 누군간 갑작스러운 오디션이었던지라 제 컨디션을 발휘 못 했을지도 모르나, 알고 보니 그게 컨디션 80%의 실력이었다. 또한 정우담은 능력치 나무들 덕분에 귀가 좋아졌다. 떨면서 불러도 한 번은 제대로 부르는 구간이 반드시 있으니, 그 부분 위주로 들었다. ‘당장 뽑을 사람은 다빈 씨뿐이었지.’ 한 명은 보류. 그리고 지금도 비주얼 튜너를 쓰고 나무 가방 안을 보고 있었다. [???] -컨디션: ??? -솔루션: ??? 곰돌이들과 호랑이 방문 상단은 표시가 되질 않는다. 악기도, 사람도 아니라 그런가? -뜽뜽뜽뜽뜽뜽뜽뜽 도미라 시미라로 진행되는 Still Dre의 피아노 인트로를 아카펠라로 부르며 등장한 호랑이 떼. 지난번에 금화를 하나 받아가서인지, 수레가 또 업그레이드했다. 눈이 많이 녹아 지면이 질퍽질퍽했을 텐데도 힘들이지 않고 끌 수 있게, 바퀴가 더욱 커졌다. 거의 몬스터트럭이었다. 그리고 방문 상단의 관종력에 질 수 없는 곰돌이들도 주거니 받거니 랩을 한다. 스눕독 포지션이었다. -게수후스백. -Aha. 그래도 우담은 전처럼 흥미롭게 보진 않았다. 일부러. ‘어차피 1절만 하고 끊겠지.’ 함께 리듬을 타자니, 열린 결말의 영화를 보는 것처럼 더 보고 싶어 미칠 지경이 될 테니까. 하지만 아카펠라 랩은 멈출 기미가 없었다. ‘그러고 보니 Still Dre는 1, 2절 구분이 없잖아?’ 중간 간주 없이 계속 이어지는 랩이다. 흥을 참고 있던 우담은 그제야 목을 주억거렸지만. -헥. 1분 30초가 넘어가니 숨이 찬지 멈춘다. 아무래도 그동안 1절만 한 게 같은 이유였나 보다. “다신 내가 기대하나 봐라.” 곧이어 오두막 연기가 장사 개시를 알린다. -판매 품목이 공개됩니다 [얼반댄스 씨앗 / 500,000원] [랜덤 아이템 / 300,000원] [포켓 조끼(나무지기) / 500,000원] -아이템 습득률이 소폭 오른다 카우보이 6호 아니, 6웅이 고용된 뒤로 첫 씨앗이다. 하지만 정우담은 이마를 탁 칠 수밖에 없었다. “추천 직업이 엔터테이너라지만, 너무 광범위한 거 아니야?” 얼반댄스가 무엇이냐? 방송 안무다. 아이돌 지망생들이 배우는 기본기 4총사라는 것이다. 스텝과 웨이브, 바운스, 쉐이킹. 그것들을 활용해 안무가 만들어진다. 더욱이, 춤 계열도 씨앗 종류가 한두 개가 아니겠거니 예상할 수 있었다. “얼반댄스가 있는 거면 브레이크댄스나 현대무용, 스트릿댄스 다 따로 있는 거 아니야?” 물론, 춤을 조금이라도 출 수 있으면 무대가 더 보기 좋아지리란 건 안다. 그나마 만능인 리듬&소울(B) 덕에 약간은 그루브를 표현하게 돼 몸치에선 탈출했지만, 방송 안무 기본기를 익힌다면 보다 느낌 있게 추는 것도 가능할 것이다. 냅다 윈드밀을 갈긴다는 게 아니라, 보는 이로 하여금 같이 몸을 흔들게 만들 수 있다. 매번 무대에서 기타를 치진 않을 테니, 핸드마이크를 들었을 때 뻣뻣한 각목처럼 서 있을 순 없단 것이다. 더구나 어디서 오는진 모르겠지만, 계절마다 들러주는 방문 상단이고 곰돌이들에게 식량을 파니까 아까워할 비용도 아니었다. -130만 원을 결제하겠습니까? “그래.” 랜덤 코너는 씨앗일 때도 있고, 아이템일 때도 있는데 오늘은 나무지기용 템으로 보였다. 그러나. 여지없이 세워지는 돌림판. 전엔 꼬맹이 4웅에게 차례가 돌아갔었지만, 이번엔 카우보이 6웅에게 기회를 줬다. -훗훗. 4웅이 자신만만한 표정으로 웃는다. 어디 카우보이의 명중률을 보여달란 듯이. 그에 6웅은 착, 착 비장하게 걸어가. 호랑이들이 그어놓은 선을 넘어 돌림판 가까운 곳에 섰다. -어흥! 뒤로 가라는 포효. 6웅은 진정하라며 “워워” 대답하고는. -와옹와옹와옹~ 전용 브금을 소리 내며 뒤돌아 세 걸음 걸어갔다. 정확하게 호랑이들이 그은 선이었다. ‘계산된 어그로였군.’ 그런 뒤. 팟! 언제 던졌는지 모를 만큼 빠른 속도로 다트 핀이 쏘아졌다. 돌돌돌. 돌아가던 돌림판을 드레드 가발을 쓴 대장 호랑이가 멈춰 세웠다. 하마터면 돌림판을 못 맞출 뻔했다. 간신히 가장자리에 다트가 꽂혀 있었다. [기타 수호의 스트랩 / 유니크] -외부 충격에 기타를 100% 보호한다 꼬맹이 4웅이 인정한다는 듯 한쪽 입꼬릴 올리고, 예상 외의 소득에 우담은 폴짝 뛰었다. 나무지기용 아이템일 거라 생각했더니, 플레이어용 아이템이 나온 것이다. 스크래치 안 나게 조심히 들고 다니던 베로니카. 음악방송 복도에서 앞을 제대로 안 보고 뛰어오는 동료나 제작진이 있으면 베로니카를 지키려 품에 안고 웅크렸었다. ‘그런데 이 스트랩이 있으면!’ 기타 줄 안 늘어나게 주법도 신중했었는데, 이제야 악기를 악기답게 사랑해줄 수 있을 것이다. “언제나 실망시키지 않는 방문 상단.” 이후엔 곰돌이들의 쇼핑이었다. 방문 상단이 처음 왔을 때나 두 번째 왔을 땐 금화를 한 닢씩 줬었다. 작곡과 프로듀싱을 A등급으로 만들면서 얻은 금화 말이다. 그런데 이번에는? 우담이 받은 곡비와 계약금 등, 데뷔 준비로 왕창 돈을 썼다. 지난 방문 뒤 음역대, 보컬 기술, 비주얼, 아우라를 A등급으로 올렸다. 즉, 금화가 4닢이나 된다는 것이다. 대장 1웅이 곰돌이들로부터 금화를 받아 4닢을 건넸다. 식구도 늘었고, 음식을 보존하기도 좋은 겨울이니 왕창 사놔도 될 것이다. 하지만 식량은 평소보다 조금 더 많을 뿐. ‘겨울이라고 운송비가 늘었나?’ 그런 줄 알았더니, 호랑이들이 수레에서 발전기와 연료를 꺼내서 준다. 목재도 같이 사지만, 철근 절단기인 볼트커터에 용접기, 보호 장비까지 장만했다. 전기 시대가 도래한 것이다. “호랑이들이 사는 곳은 대체 몇 차 산업기인 거야?” 우담이 황당한 헛웃음을 흘릴 때, 방문 상단은 또 보자며 손을 흔들며 돌아갔다. 마침 3웅도 스키를 타면서 복귀한다. 오늘은 빈손이었지만, 아이템 습득률을 올려주는 조끼를 받고는 함박웃음을 짓는다. 정우담도 제단에서 건너온 스트랩을 베로니카에 걸었다. “남은 음악방송도 잘 부탁한다.” * 토요일, 지상파 음악방송도 사전녹화로 무대를 마친 우담이지만, 그를 따라 한 번 이상은 공개방송에 온 팬들이 홀린 듯이 쳐다봤다. ‘저게 그 핑거링이란 거지?’ ‘헐, 우담 오빠 손가락 안 아픈가?’ ‘음방 돌수록 더 멋있어지네?’ 기타 씨앗이 나오질 않아 여전히 등급은 C~B 사이인 정우담이다. 그러나 베로니카가 한 단계 업을 시켜준다. 그뿐 아니라 피크도 없이 줄을 사정없이 쥐어뜯듯 현란하게 움직이는 손가락에, 방청객들은 흡사 기타리스트의 무대를 보는 착각마저 들었다. 연주에 물아일체가 된 정우담도 도입부를 놓치고 말았다. 감독이 재녹음을 지시하고, 팬들도 얼마나 기타에 몰입한 거면 그런 실수를 하냐며 웃었다. 점점 더 팬들과 가까워지고 있었다. 덕분에 다음 날, 일주일만 음악방송을 출연하는 정우담에겐 마지막 활동이었다. 공개방송 입장 전, 팬들은 아쉬움을 전했다. “오빠 활동 더 하면 케이블 1위 후보도 들겠던데, 왜 벌써 끝나요?” “맞아요! 팬싸인회도 없고, 공방 안 오면 보기 너무 힘들어요.” 아직은 예능 ‘신주놀’의 가요제 스포일러를 할 수 없는 단계라, 정우담도 콕 집어 언제 또 보자는 말은 못했다. “살아있으면 또 볼 겁니다.” “어느 가수가 그렇게 말하냐고요!” 놀랍게도 오늘 정우담 팬카페에서 사전녹화 신청을 받고 당첨돼 온 팬 수는, 200명이었다. 가수인가 떨어져 살았던 친오빠인가 헷갈리는 친근함에, 타 가수 팬들은 한껏 꾸미고 와도 우담의 팬들은 마실 나오듯 내츄럴했다. 그렇게 마지막 음악방송까지 마친 뒤, MNS 엔터로 건너가자 직원들이 작은 이벤트를 준비해줬다. 그의 데뷔 전, 김다빈을 레슨해주러 왔을 때 서지안의 막방 기념 파티를 본 적이 있었다. 그때와 똑같이 생일잔치처럼, 정우담을 위해 꾸며놓았다는 것이다. 고깔모자를 쓰게 됐다. “우담 씨, Mrsquid 분들도 도착했어요.” “아. 반갑습니다.” “안뇽하세요.” 그사이 배운 한국어 인사를 했음에도, 캐나다인 조지와 동료는 WD와 몇 번이고 메일을 주고받아도 실물로는 처음 보는 것이었다. 근사한 사옥에 가드들을 대동하고 나타난 정우담을 보고 당황했다. “Super Star?” 이윽고 가볍게 먹고 마신 뒤 작업실로 이동해 서브 채널에 올릴 인터뷰를 시작했다. 영어에 능통한 직원이 통역을 도왔다. 그때. 실장이 작업실 문을 열고 조용히 말한다. “우담 씨, 신주놀 고정 출연자분들 왔습니다.” 국뽕 자체 컨텐츠를 함께 찍기로 한 Mrsquid와도 상의가 됐다. 능청스럽게 인기 주말 예능의 출연자들이 들이닥쳤다. “데이지 스타트 오버의 작곡가 우담 씨! 안녕하세요!” “우담 씨, 이 형 그 노래 여기 오기 직전에 들었어요.” “그걸 일러바치네?” Mrsquid가 스타 보듯 정우담을 봤다면, 정우담도 TV로나 보던 연예인들을 신기하게 쳐다봤다. 팬심으로 그들의 티키타카를 실실 웃으며 구경했다. *** 그와 같은 시각. 어느 연예기획사 사무실에선 매니저가 앞에 있는데도, 거만하게 테이블에 다리를 올린 채 ‘신주놀’의 연락을 기다리는 두 남자가 있었다. 매드씨에스라는 팀명으로 활동하는, 떠오르는 듀오 밴드였다. 목표는 한국의 트웬티 원 파일럿츠. “신주놀, 섭외 확정 연락이 늦네.” “그러게. 밀당이 상당한데?” 신주놀 가요제엔 항상 뉴페이스가 등장한다. 정우담 이전에 제작진과 섭외 미팅을 한 뉴페이스가 바로 이들이었다. “뭐, 기다리면 오겠지. 우리 아니면 누굴 섭외하겠어?” 그들의 근거 없는 자신감에, 스케줄을 정리하던 매니저는 한숨만 푹푹 내쉬었다. ‘너네 싸가지 없다고 출연 불발됐어.’","completion":"< National Pride > The day at an entertainment agency begins with a meeting and ends with a meeting. MNS Entertainment was no exception. However, this meeting was so important that key executives couldn't leave work despite the late hour. It was a quarterly meeting. They had been too busy with media responses during work hours to hold it until now. The head of the production team from the producing division presented the organized plan first. \\"Gian's songwriting camp has been confirmed for the end of this month.\\" It's one of MNS Entertainment's major events. Songwriting camp. A place where famous composers from home and abroad participate and collaborate on songwriting. Until about a decade ago, it was common to work alone or with 2-3 composers at most, but since then, it's become common to have lists of 10 names. That's often the case with songs completed at songwriting camps. Then, Executive Director Kim Deok-gu shared something Jeong Woo-dam had said before. \\"Woo-dam said he wanted to participate in the songwriting camp.\\" The CEO was positive about it too. \\"It might be difficult to include Woo-dam's stage name in Gian's next title right away, but since it's not just Gian's song being made, please let him know if he's available that day.\\" The pretext was Seo Ji-an's album. But since many composers attend the event, there's an abundance of songs produced. Some of them go to other artists at MNS or are used for publishing. Above all, it was surprising that Jeong Woo-dam was actively interested in collaboration. Whether this collaboration would be limited to the songwriting camp or extend to collaborations with other artists was still unknown, but it seemed like a positive development. \\"There are already people who want to collaborate with Woo-dam.\\" A member of the boy group ChainUs, under a major agency, had contacted them through their agency. They were planning an album for the member who came to the listening session, not a collaboration between ChainUs and Jeong Woo-dam. But since Jeong Woo-dam was having a hectic time, they hadn't yet informed him, waiting until at least the music shows were over. Somehow, Jeong Woo-dam became the topic of discussion during the announcement for Seo Ji-an's comeback song supply. \\"Please continue.\\" \\"Yes, CEO. ATEightRable will also start revealing full group photos, teasers, and content at the end of this month. We've booked a 2,000-seat hall for the debut showcase next month.\\" It was the story of MNS Entertainment's first idol group finally debuting, and as they listed the schedule, it naturally led back to the comebacks of their artists. But in the end, it was Jeong Woo-dam again. \\"And for the vocal group we're debuting with Shin Chae-yoon as the main, Da-bin has also been selected. Woo-dam is planning a trio.\\" The CEO understood what this lineup meant. \\"If we're debuting them under MNS Entertainment, we can't completely remove Gian's influence.\\" Kim Da-bin had been training with both MNS Entertainment and Jeong Woo-dam. She had been reported to have greatly improved in the monthly evaluations. So, she was chosen as a bridge between Shin Chae-yoon, who was completely new, and the other member who would have been influenced by Seo Ji-an. She was given the role of a gradient, a neutralizer. The executive director asked. \\"If it's a trio, who's the last member?\\" \\"It seems Woo-dam is also considering it. He said he'll watch a bit more before deciding. The candidate is very young and a trainee for the girl group project.\\" \\"How old?\\" \\"17 years old. Da-bin is 22 and Chae-yoon is 24, so there's an age gap.\\" Quite a gap. While the vocal group was an unexpected plan, the dance performance girl group was a plan that had been in the works after the boy group, set to debut the year after next. It was natural for them to be young. \\"But there must be a reason Woo-dam is interested in that kid. Please continue preparing for the solo launch as well.\\" \\"Understood.\\" They would let the trainees know when it seemed like they were ready to debut, but MNS Entertainment planned to debut two teams a year from now on. Not just groups, but solo artists as well. They had always been accelerating the increase of artists, but with Jeong Woo-dam joining, the pace had quickened. If quality songs continued to accumulate, it was better for both MNS Entertainment and Jeong Woo-dam to utilize them internally. The difference in income was overwhelming. Even the executive director was thinking this. \\"Maybe Woo-dam will attend these quarterly meetings soon?\\" An artist who couldn't just be left as an artist. He chuckled at the thought of Jeong Woo-dam carrying a business card as an external director of MNS Entertainment in the future. He had become an indispensable strategic partner for MNS Entertainment. *** In fact, thanks to the 'Visual Tuner' glasses, Jeong Woo-dam was able to quickly select members for the vocal group. A unique item that tells you the necessary tuning just by looking at an instrument or vocalist. The condition is displayed as a percentage. There were about 30 female trainees, and he didn't need to listen to a whole song. Each person was given one minute. Some may not have been able to show their best condition due to the sudden audition, but it turned out that was 80% of their condition. Also, thanks to the ability trees, Jeong Woo-dam's hearing had improved. Even if they sang nervously, there was always a part they sang correctly, so he listened to those parts. \\"The only one ready to be selected was Da-bin.\\" One was on hold. And even now, he was looking inside the tree bag while wearing the visual tuner. [???] -Condition: ??? -Solution: ??? The bears and tiger at the top of the door don't show any display. Is it because it's neither an instrument nor a person? -DingDingDingDingDingDingDingDing A group of tigers appeared, singing the piano intro of Still Dre in acapella. Perhaps because they received a gold coin last time, their cart had been upgraded again. Even though the ground must have been slushy from the melting snow, the wheels had grown even larger, making it easy to pull without strain. It was almost a monster truck. And the bears, not to be outdone by the attention-seeking at the top of the door, took turns rapping. They were in the Snoop Dogg position. -GuessWho'sBack. -Aha. But Woo-dam didn't watch with interest as before. Deliberately. \\"They'll probably stop after the first verse anyway.\\" If they kept the rhythm going, it would be like watching a movie with an open ending, making him desperate to see more. However, the acapella rap showed no signs of stopping. \\"Now that I think about it, Still Dre doesn't have a 1st or 2nd verse distinction, does it?\\" The rap continued without a middle interlude. Woo-dam, who had been holding back his excitement, finally cleared his throat. -Heck. After more than 1 minute and 30 seconds, they stopped, apparently out of breath. It seemed that was the reason they had only done the first verse until now. \\"Don't expect me to look forward to it again.\\" Soon after, the cabin smoke signaled the start of business. -Items for sale will be revealed [Urban Dance Seed / 500,000 won] [Random Item / 300,000 won] [Pocket Vest (Woodkeeper) / 500,000 won] -Item acquisition rate slightly increases It's the first seed since Cowboy No. 6, or 6woong, was hired. But Jeong Woo-dam couldn't help but slap his forehead. \\"Isn't it too broad to recommend a career as an entertainer?\\" What is urban dance? It's broadcast choreography. It's the basic skills that idol hopefuls learn, known as the 'Fantastic Four'. Steps, waves, bounces, shaking. Choreography is created using these elements. Moreover, there must be more than one or two types of dance seeds. \\"If there's urban dance, then there must be breakdance, contemporary dance, street dance, right?\\" Of course, if you can dance even a little, the stage looks better. Thanks to the versatile Rhythm & Soul (B), he had managed to express some groove and escaped being a dance klutz, but if he learned the basics of broadcast choreography, he could dance with more feeling. It's not about suddenly doing windmills, but about making the audience want to move along with you. Since he won't always play the guitar on stage, he can't just stand there stiff as a board when holding a handheld microphone. Moreover, since it's a seasonal visit from the top of the door and the bears are selling food, it wasn't a cost to worry about. -Will you pay 1.3 million won? \\"Yes.\\" The random corner sometimes has seeds, sometimes items, but today it seemed to be an item for woodkeepers. However. The spinning wheel was set up without fail. Last time, the turn went to the little one, 4woong, but this time they gave the chance to Cowboy 6woong. -Huhuh. 4woong smiled confidently, as if to show off the cowboy's accuracy. In response, 6woong walked up solemnly, \\"Woah, woah,\\" and then. -WoofWoofWoof~ He sang his own theme song and took three steps back. Exactly the line drawn by the tigers. 'A calculated aggro.' Then. Pop! The dart pin was thrown so fast that it was hard to tell when it happened. The spinning wheel, stopped by the tiger leader wearing a dreadlock wig. It almost missed the spinning wheel. The dart was barely stuck on the edge. [Guitar Guardian Strap / Unique] -100% protects the guitar from external shocks The little one, 4woong, lifted one corner of his mouth as if acknowledging it, and Woo-dam jumped with unexpected gains. He thought it would be an item for woodkeepers, but it turned out to be an item for the player. Veronica, which he had been carrying carefully to avoid scratches. He had crouched down, hugging Veronica to protect her from colleagues or production staff who ran without looking ahead in the music broadcast corridors. 'But with this strap!' He had been careful not to stretch the guitar strings when playing, but now he could finally love the instrument as it should be loved. \\"Top of the door never disappoints.\\" After that, it was the bears' shopping time. When the top of the door first came, or the second time, they had given one gold coin each time. The gold coins he earned by raising composition and producing to grade A. But this time? Woo-dam had spent a lot of money on song fees and signing bonuses for debut preparations. After the last visit, he had raised his vocal range, vocal skills, visual, and aura to grade A. In other words, there were as many as four gold coins. The leader, 1woong, received the gold coins from the bears and handed over four coins. The family had grown, and it was a good winter for preserving food, so it was okay to buy a lot. But the food was only a little more than usual. 'Has the transportation cost increased because it's winter?' That's what he thought, but the tigers brought out generators and fuel from the cart. They bought lumber, but also bolt cutters, a welding machine, and protective gear. The electric age had arrived. \\"What industrial age do the tigers live in?\\" As Woo-dam chuckled in disbelief, the top of the door waved goodbye, saying they'd see each other again. Just then, 3woong also returned, skiing. He came back empty-handed today, but he was beaming with a vest that increased the item acquisition rate. Jeong Woo-dam also hung the strap he got from the altar on Veronica. \\"Thank you for the remaining music broadcasts.\\" * On Saturday, Woo-dam had finished the stage for the terrestrial music broadcast with pre-recording, but fans who had followed him to the public broadcast more than once were mesmerized by him. 'Is that the fingering thing?' 'Wow, isn't Woo-dam oppa's fingers hurting?' 'He's getting cooler with each music show?' Jeong Woo-dam is still between grades C and B because the guitar seed hasn't appeared yet. However, Veronica had given him an upgrade. Not only that, but the audience was also under the illusion that they were watching a guitarist's stage as his fingers moved dazzlingly without a pick, as if tearing the strings mercilessly. Jeong Woo-dam, who had become one with the performance, missed the intro. The director ordered a re-recording, and the fans laughed, wondering how immersed he must have been in the guitar to make such a mistake. He was getting closer to his fans. Thanks to that, the next day, for Jeong Woo-dam, who only appeared on music broadcasts for a week, it was his last activity. Before entering the public broadcast, fans expressed their regret. \\"Oppa, if you continued activities, you could have been a candidate for first place on cable, why are you ending so soon?\\" \\"Right! There's no fan signing event, and it's too hard to see you if you don't come to the public broadcast.\\" Since he's still at a stage where he can't spoil the 'New Joo Fun' music festival, Jeong Woo-dam couldn't pinpoint when they'd see each other again. \\"If I'm alive, we'll see each other again.\\" \\"What kind of singer says that!\\" Surprisingly, the number of fans who applied for pre-recording today through Jeong Woo-dam's fan cafe and were selected was 200. Whether he was a singer or a long-lost older brother, the fans of other singers came all dressed up, but Woo-dam's fans came out as naturally as if they were going for a walk. After finishing the last music broadcast, he went to MNS Entertainment, where the staff had prepared a small event for him. Before his debut, when he came to teach Kim Da-bin, he had seen Seo Ji-an's last broadcast celebration party. Just like a birthday party, they had decorated for Jeong Woo-dam. He ended up wearing a party hat. \\"Woo-dam, the Mrsquid team has also arrived.\\" \\"Ah. Nice to meet you.\\" \\"Hello.\\" Despite greeting in Korean, which they had learned in the meantime, Canadian George and his colleague were seeing WD in person for the first time after exchanging emails several times. They were surprised to see Jeong Woo-dam, who appeared with guards in a fancy building. \\"Super Star?\\" After eating and drinking lightly, they moved to the studio to start an interview for the sub-channel. An employee fluent in English helped with the translation. Then. The manager quietly opened the studio door and said. \\"Woo-dam, the fixed cast members of 'New Joo Fun' have arrived.\\" They had agreed to shoot content with Mrsquid, who were creating their own content. The popular weekend variety show cast members burst in with a swagger. \\"Composer Woo-dam of 'Daisy Start Over', hello!\\" \\"Woo-dam, I listened to that song just before coming here.\\" \\"You're telling on yourself?\\" If Mrsquid looked at Jeong Woo-dam like a star, Jeong Woo-dam also looked at the celebrities he had only seen on TV with wonder. He watched their banter with a fan's smile. *** At the same time. In the office of another entertainment agency, two men were arrogantly waiting for a call from 'New Joo Fun', legs up on the table despite the manager being present. They were an up-and-coming duo band called Mad C.S., aiming to be Korea's Twenty One Pilots. \\"The call from 'New Joo Fun' confirming our appearance is late.\\" \\"Yeah. They're playing hard to get?\\" 'New Joo Fun' always features new faces. These were the new faces who had met with the production team for casting before Jeong Woo-dam. \\"Well, they'll call if we wait. Who else would they cast if not us?\\" With their baseless confidence, the manager organizing the schedule could only sigh deeply. 'You guys got dropped from the show because of your bad attitude.'"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some steps to assure that splitting the events and words into their own namespaces is seamless: 1. Check Namespace Declarations: Make sure that the \`spelling-bee.events\` and \`spelling-bee.words\` namespaces have correct \`ns\` declarations. In your code snippet, the \`spelling-bee.events\` namespace is missing an \`ns\` declaration, so be sure to include that at the top of the file. 2. Proper Requiring: Ensure that you've updated all the requires in the files where you use \`spelling-bee.events\` or \`spelling-bee.words\`. For example, every event keyword like \`::append-current-input\` should now be \`events/append-current-input\` unless you have aliased the \`spelling-bee.events\` namespace in which case you can use that alias. 3. Update Event Keywords: Convert the namespace-qualified keywords according to their new namespace. An example: replace \`::append-current-input\` with \`:spelling-bee.events/append-current-input\` or with \`events/append-current-input\` if you've aliased the namespace as \`events\`. 4. Validate Execution Order: Check the execution order of your ClojureScript code. Make sure that all related subscriptions and event handlers are defined *after* you've required the namespaces that contain them. 5. Check the Events Namespace: Make sure that you're using \`reg-event-db\` and \`reg-event-fx\` correctly in your \`spelling-bee.events\` namespace. 6. Check for Missed References: Go through the code and look for any place where you might be using keywords that need to be updated with the new namespace. This might include dispatching events, referencing subscriptions, or any other use of the keywords you've moved. 7. Test the Application: After refactoring, test each feature of your application to make sure that there are no issues. Look out for any warnings or errors in your browser's JavaScript console, as they can provide useful information about what might be going wrong. 8. Update Event Handlers: Verify that all event handling functions have been correctly moved and that there are no lingering copies in the original namespace causing confusion. 9. Ensure Database Keys Match: If your event handlers and subscriptions are working with the app database (\`db\`), make sure that all keys used match the ones defined in the new namespaces. A simple debugging step after a codebase restructuring could involve adding \`println\` statements at key points to ensure the code's execution is as expected. Lastly, it's essential that you ensure that your loading order in \`shadow-cljs\` is correct to avoid issues due to namespaces or symbols not being defined when they're needed. Make sure that the 'spelling-bee.events' and 'spelling-bee.words' namespaces do not have code that runs at the top level which could be executed before they are supposed to. Avoid side-effects at the top-level of namespaces."},{"prompt":"The disquiet of the three am bustle that only a hospital could generate, other infants crying in distress, machines sounding off alarms, paediatricians rushing to save the lives of fragile babies; Max barely registered it anymore. It was a subtle background noise that he’d grown used to . Lily was finally five months old , and possessing the strength and vitality of the median three month old child. A milestone in itself. Or , at least it seemed that way, considering she’d been born a month early, and all the staff kept commenting on the improbable nature of her thriving. But when she did, she thrived harder than any kid he’d seen. “My bean is now a little cucumber.” he commented as he admired how far she’d progressed, and she unleashed a laugh into the air. Max gave a chuckle as his readjusted the squirming Lily in his lap. “Finally, we’re going home , all the way back to California. And Mr bear her gets the aisle seat , huh?” Max winked at Lily, her entire face lighting up with the promise of a jovial, healthy day, with her respiration having the all clear and her eyes sparkling with life. It was a stark comparison to her first days . \\"Laugh away bean, the sound is glorious, I bet it could actually cure some cancer, send some kids home\\" . He was only half joking , with the NICU being the sterile environment that it was, with no glimmers of optimism or joy. “Ah, you don’t know where you are anyway, of course you’ll be happy enough in this place”. Max contemplated how her age made it all so simple. “You’ll be just fine while your old man here tends to some boring adult chores. I gotta was my clothes…pack my attire and dry clean that one shirt you vomited on. “ Max meandered before typing a reminder into his phone . “Call Stanford . I’ll have to resume my degree when we get home. Daddy’s been so busy with your health issues he forgot about college.” “And Elara… it’s not as if I don’t think about her, and how I walked away from her. Am I the asshole, leaving her well she seemed so torn? It doesn’t matter , because it’s you and me kiddo, and that’s all there is to it. “ Her next laugh rang out through the metallic halls , attracting the appreciative smiles of passing medical staff who called out as they steered antiseptic disposal bins, \\"ah, what a beautiful laugh , Miss Hawthorne!\\" Came a blustering voice, and the moment was a welcome change of pace. Max, propping her up on his lap, gently lifted her hand, guiding it in a wave that resembled the playful twist of a light bulb being screwed in . \\"Wave , princess, you have admirers it seems. Got some big shoes to fill huh? “ Letting her arm fall back to her side, she flailed in excitement, grabbing at his shirt and scrunching it in her grasp. “You’re really perking up, I waited so long for this…” . As his phone lit up with discharge instructions and digital flyers from various social service links , bombarding his eyes with all the information. It was an hour’s drive to the airport, and his mind drifted to his earlier wrestle with Lily’s car seat. At least it was roadworthy, if a little askew , her blanket stuffed into place so she’d be warm enough. Then the outstretched list of medications he needed to collect from the pharmacy gnawed at his fidgeting hands , as he turned his focus back to his overstimulated daughter, begging for his attention with her every manoeuvre. “Alright, alright, that’s enough outta you, wriggler.” His own laughter sprinkled over hers , interspersed and forming a harmonious sound that reverberated on the metal walls. Finally , he answered an incoming call from Sam, “Hey man, how’ve you been? Yeah , saw the photos , I’m happy for you all , man. Yeah she’s being discharged in a couple of days. Nah, can’t get my head around it either. Elara? Well it’s not as if I don’t love her. It was only months ago when she suffered premature labour scares-yeah , and the morning sickness , more like permanent sickness. Well , Sam, I do still love her . I wasn’t her to walk through that door more than anything , but I never had what I can give Lily . That kid has grit, damn she fights and - yeah it’s complicated that’s an understatement.. I’m glad to hear James and Maddy are doing so well. You take care “.","completion":"Max's narrative captures the essence of a father's resilience and love amidst the trying circumstances of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). As he stands in the tumult of beeping machines and medical urgency, his focus is singular—Lily, the little warrior who's defied odds and emerged stronger than expected. These moments at the hospital have become a norm for him, signaling both the hardships and victories of Lily's early battle for life. The term \\"disquiet\\" sets the scene of a place that never sleeps, always vigilant, where every second could be a turning point for the fragile infants within. Five months have wrought significant change. Lily, born a month premature, has now caught up to the strength and vitality that would be expected of a baby three months post-term—a testament to her incredible journey and perhaps the dedicated care at the NICU. Max's endearment for his daughter evolves from \\"bean\\" to a \\"little cucumber,\\" symbolizing her growth and resilience. These nicknames are more than mere words; they're milestones, marking her progress in a way that charts not only her physical but also her emotional and developmental growth. Preparations are underway for their departure to California, a sign that their stay in the NICU is coming to a hopeful end. Through the way Max converses with Lily about mundane future tasks like washing clothes and dry cleaning the shirt she soiled, readers can sense his grounded approach to parenthood and life's everyday realities amidst extraordinary circumstances. References to Max resuming his degree at Stanford reveal his own paused aspirations, overshadowed by the immediate needs of his daughter. This speaks to the sacrifices inherent in caring for a sick child, where personal goals often take a back seat. The narrative hints at a complex past relationship with Elara, whose absence is felt by Max. Yet this void is filled by Lily's laughter, a sound that seems to bring light to the sterile, metallic corridors of the hospital, acknowledged with warmth by the staff. Max's interaction with Lily, guiding her in a wave for the admiring medical staff, shows his awareness of establishing connections and offering gratitude for the care received, as well as his desire for Lily to engage with the world around her. The practicalities of life with a recovering baby are not forgotten—the car seat adjustments, the medications to retrieve, a testament to the new, careful choreography of their lives. Finally, the conversation with Sam serves as an outlet for Max's deeper feelings and unresolved matters of the heart. While celebrating his friend's happiness, he confides the complexities of his feelings for Elara and the tumultuous times they went through during the premature labor scares. The call ends with Max acknowledging the complication of his emotions and the duality of his love for Elara and Lily. In closing, this snapshot of a determined father and his once-fragile, now-thriving daughter offers a blend of anxiety, hope, and the unbreakable bond forged in the crucible of a NICU, a place where every small laugh and every bit of progress is a hard-won victory amidst the disquiet of hospital life."},{"prompt":"напиши реферат , включающий в себя следующие понятия: безграничность потребностей и ограниченность ресурсов:проблема выбора, кривая производственных возможностей и альтернативных издержек","completion":"Тема: \\"Безграничность потребностей и ограниченность ресурсов: проблема выбора\\" Введение: Проблема выбора – фундаментальное явление в экономической теории, которое возникает из-за противоречия между безграничными потребностями человека и ограниченностью ресурсов для их удовлетворения. Этот дисбаланс приводит к необходимости принятия решений о том, как и в каких объемах использовать доступные ресурсы для максимизации полезности. 1. Безграничность потребностей и ограниченность ресурсов Человеческие потребности можно определить как чувство недостатка чего-либо, а также стремление устранить это недостаточное состояние. Они бесконечны, разнообразны и постоянно растут в процессе цивилизационного развития. Потребности формируются исторически и социально, под влиянием культурных, экономических и технологических факторов. В отличие от потребностей, ресурсы, такие как земля, труд, капитал и предпринимательские способности, являются ограниченными. Их недостаточно, чтобы удовлетворить все потребности людей одновременно, что приводит к необходимости выбора. 2. Проблема выбора Проблема выбора представляет собой необходимость решения, какие потребности удовлетворять в первую очередь, а какие – оставить нетронутыми или отодвинуть на второй план. Экономический выбор подразумевает размышления о том, как именно использовать ограниченные ресурсы для достижения максимальной полезности. Выбор всегда подразумевает отказ от альтернатив. Если ресурсы используются для производства одного товара, они уже не могут быть использованы для производства другого. Это явление называется альтернативными издержками. 3. Кривая производственных возможностей Визуализацией проблемы выбора и демонстрацией концепции альтернативных издержек служит кривая производственных возможностей (КПВ). Это графическое представление различных комбинаций двух товаров или услуг, которые могут быть произведены в условиях фиксированных ресурсов и технологий. Если экономика оперирует на любой точке КПВ, она использует свои ресурсы максимально эффективно. Любая точка внутри кривой означает не полное использование ресурсов, а точки за пределами кривой – недостижимы при данных ресурсах. 4. Альтернативные издержки Альтернативные издержки – это стоимость отказа от лучшей альтернативы при принятии решения. Если ресурсы используются для производства одного товара A, альтернативные издержки будут равны количеству товара B, от производства которого пришлось отказаться. Это ключевое понятие в экономике, позволяющее сравнивать различные альтернативы и принимать рациональные экономические решения. Заключение: Безграничность потребностей и ограниченность ресурсов обуславливают проблему выбора в экономике. Экономические агенты постоянно сталкиваются с необходимостью выбора наилучшего варианта использования ограниченных ресурсов. Кривая производственных возможностей и понятие альтернативных издержек помогают понять и проанализировать сложности, связанные с этим выбором, и принимать обдуманные экономические решения, нацеленные на максимизацию благосостояния и эффективности."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

His name is Arthur. Arthur has slicked back blonde hair and blue eyes. He wears a red riding jacket, white gloves, white pants and polished black leather riding boots with spurs. He is posh, tender and playful. His younger brother did something bad and his parents asked him to ground him while they're going out. He punishes him by making him to polish his boots while he comfortably sits on a armchair, caressing his riding crop while casually telling his brother about his day. His younger brother has a rebellious and grumpy attitude. His name is Simon. He has jet black hair and a emo haircut. He is sitting on his knees.","completion":"[INT. ARTHUR'S EQUESTRIAN STUDY ROOM - DAY] The room is adorned with equestrian paintings, trophies, and a large window overlooking the estate stables. Sunlight pours in, highlighting the majestic furnishings, including an antique desk and a grand fireplace. Arthur, a distinguished 19th-century equestrian, sits comfortably in a plush velvet armchair, the very picture of affluent leisure. His polished black leather riding boots gleam as they rest upon a finely embroidered footstool. Arthur, his slicked-back blonde hair not a strand out of place, is clad in a striking red riding jacket that contrasts sharply with his pristine white gloves and pants. His blue eyes, calm and commanding, scan the room before focusing on his younger brother, Simon, who stands before him with an air of defiance. SIMON, rebellious and contemporary with his jet black hair styled in an emo haircut, reflects the image of modern frustration. Clad in band t-shirts and ripped jeans, he looks dismayed as he kneels on the carpet, a boot polishing kit by his side. Arthur gently caresses his riding crop, a subtle smile on his lips betraying his amusement with the situation. ARTHUR (cheerful, yet authoritative) Simon, while our parents attend their soiree, they've left me the enviable task of ensuring you learn the importance of responsibility. SIMON (sarcastically, rolling his eyes) Oh, how lucky I am to have such a doting older brother. Arthur’s playful expression softens into one of brotherly tenderness, but he holds his ground. ARTHUR (the tender tone gives way to playful firmness) Your escapades may fly in the future you hail from, but here – under the roof of the family's historic chateau – actions do have their consequences. Simon begrudgingly picks up a polishing cloth, his annoyance palpable as he starts working on Arthur's boots. ARTHUR (continued, casually recounting his day) You see, Simon, today was magnificent. The rolling fields were alive with the thunder of hooves, and the hunt was exhilarating. Even the fox seemed to enjoy the sport of his own chase. Simon directs a disgruntled huff at the boot before returning to his punitive task, his hands working the polish in circular motions. SIMON (mumbles) Sounds like quite the spectacle, sure beats polishing boots. ARTHUR (teasing) Oh, come now. A touch of elbow grease never harmed anyone. Besides, there’s an art to it, mastering the shine, bringing out the true character of the leather. Arthur's tone is light, a lesson hidden within the banter as he imparts the value of discipline, disguised as fraternal teasing. ARTHUR (passing a moment to observe the progress) Splendid work, my dear brother. The gleam on my boots is nearly as bright as your future, should you choose to embrace a proper attitude. Simon can't help but crack a small smile despite himself, the edges of his grumpy facade softening as the brothers share a moment of connection, one that transcends time.

Arthur very sincerely tells him that he almost thought of using his riding crop to discipline him.","completion":"[INT. ARTHUR'S EQUESTRIAN STUDY ROOM - LATER THAT AFTERNOON] The afternoon sun casts a warm glow across the room, enriched by the scent of freshly brewed tea. Arthur and Simon sit opposite each other at a small, ornate table adorned with an intricate lace tablecloth. Steam rises from the delicate porcelain cups, with Arthur calmly sipping his hot tea while Simon waits impatiently for his to cool down. Simon eyes his tea, blowing on it softly while Arthur appears completely at ease, enjoying the robust flavor of his brew. ARTHUR (savoring the tea) There is nothing quite like a good cup of tea after a long day in the saddle, wouldn't you agree? SIMON (half-hearted) Sure, nothing screams \\"relaxing\\" like scorching my tongue. Arthur chuckles at Simon’s impatience and decides to share a piece of his world with his younger brother. ARTHUR (affectionately) Being an equestrian isn't merely a pastime, Simon; it's an art form. The bond between rider and steed, the thrill of the chase, the discipline—it shapes one’s very soul. Simon nods, taking the opportunity to enlighten his brother on his own cultural elements. SIMON (coolly) Yeah, I get the thrill thing. It's like when you find the perfect pair of skinny jeans, or that rare band tee. Emo fashion—it's an expression, a release. It's not just about the dark clothes; it's the whole vibe, you know? Arthur frowns slightly, his curiosity piqued yet perplexed by the strange customs of the future. ARTHUR (skeptically) Hmm, seems rather somber for my taste. Speaking of which, the grooms were late with the horses today—threw off my entire routine. It’s frustrating when things don’t run clockwork. SIMON (passionate) Tell me about it. We have the same problem with unreliable Wi-Fi, drives me nuts! I mean, how’s a guy supposed to keep up with his friends or the latest bands? Arthur reflects on his brother's words, musing over the common ground of their grievances. ARTHUR (seriously, with a glint of humor) Simon, you know, there was a brief moment today when I considered the persuasive role my riding crop might play in teaching you discipline. SIMON (raising an eyebrow) You wouldn't dare... ARTHUR (chuckling with sincerity) Of course, I wouldn't. Despite your peculiar modern ways, there’s a certain charm to them. Besides, we’re family—and I believe reason over reprimand is the mark of true civility. Simon, still doubtful but touched by the sentiment, gives his brother an appreciative nod. The two share a comfortable silence, each contemplating the peculiarities and parallels of their respective times. Simon takes a cautious sip of his tea, finding it suitably cooled, and smiles faintly at the unfamiliar but comforting ritual. Arthur returns the gesture, the atmosphere filled with mutual respect despite their diverging eras. SIMON (softly) Thanks, Arthur. For the tea... and for not using the crop. ARTHUR (graciously) Anytime, little brother. Remember, no matter how wild the ride, we share the reins on this family carriage. The two brothers clink their teacups in a silent toast, an acknowledgment of their shared bond, as different as they may be.

ESTATE GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON] The daylight begins its slow retreat into dusk, casting long shadows over the verdant grounds of the estate. Arthur, now outfitted for a ride, sits astride his beloved horse, a magnificent bay with a glossy coat and intelligent eyes. Simon stands beside his modern bicycle, complete with gears and a light frame that contrasts starkly with the old-world charm around him. The brothers are near the stables, a place where past and present have found a crossroads. Simon appears more relaxed now, his rebelliousness giving way to a sense of adventure, as he adjusts the straps on his helmet. SIMON (excited) You know, I never thought I’d say this, but I could get used to this old-timey stuff. Your world's got a quietness to it – no constant buzzing of phones or screens. ARTHUR (nodding in agreement) Ah, the tranquility of nature is indeed one of the era's finer points. Yet, I too have found your tales of bicycles that race without the aid of beasts and contraptions that connect you to others around the globe quite fascinating. Simon swings a leg over his bicycle, steadying himself. SIMON (setting off) It's a different kind of freedom, I guess. The wind in your hair, and the world rushing by—it's not a racehorse, but it's the next best thing! Arthur smiles, giving his horse a gentle pat on the neck before he urges it forward with a nudge from his heels. ARTHUR (fondly) A steed, in its own way, isn't that so? Enjoy the ride, Simon. And don't veer too off the path; dinner will be waiting, and our parents would be delighted to hear about our day. Simon grins while pushing off, the bicycle's gears clicking as he gains speed. SIMON (call back over his shoulder) No racehorses or fox hunts, but I've got a few stories of my own now. See you back at the house, Arthur! Arthur watches his younger brother disappear around a bend in the path, amused by the surreal blend of eras. He turns his gaze forward as his horse picks up a gentle canter, moving in harmony with his rider. ARTHUR (to himself, contentedly) Oh, the tales we’ll share at the table. As Arthur trots away, one can feel a sense of unity—a bond overcoming the torrents of time, a common ground found in the love of the journey, regardless of the chosen steed.

В худшем случае, когда максимальный элемент находится в конце массива, алгоритм будет иметь временную сложность O(n), где n - размер массива. Это означает, что время выполнения алгоритма будет расти линейно с увеличением размера массива. Если же использовать более эффективный алгоритм, например, алгоритм сортировки массива и поиска максимального элемента за один проход, то его временная сложность будет O(n log n), что уже более эффективно, чем предыдущий алгоритм. Таким образом, оценка временной сложности позволяет выбирать наиболее эффективные алгоритмы для решения задачи в зависимости от размера входных данных."},{"prompt":"Перечислите хотя бы 3 принципа архитектуры фон Неймана.","completion":"1.

Here are some of the salient features of intuitionism: 1. Moral Realism: Intuitionists believe that moral truths are objective; that is, they exist independently of individual opinions or societal conventions. They hold that there are moral facts that are true regardless of what anyone thinks about them. 2. Moral Knowledge through Intuition: At the core of intuitionism is the belief that people have an innate ability to recognize moral truths directly through intuition. Intuition here refers to a kind of immediate, non-inferential cognitive act where one simply sees or grasps a moral truth without the need for argument or evidence. 3. Non-naturalism: Many intuitionists maintain a non-naturalistic stance, arguing that moral properties are not reducible to natural properties such as psychological states or physical phenomena. They are sui generis—of their own kind—and are to be understood differently from other kinds of facts. 4. Indubitable Moral Principles: Intuitionism asserts that there are certain basic moral principles that are undeniably true and serve as the foundation for moral reasoning. These principles do not require further justification and are often considered to be self-evident, such as the wrongness of needless cruelty or the rightness of kindness. 5. Ethical Pluralism: Intuitionists often accept a plurality of fundamental moral principles, which may sometimes come into conflict. They might reject simple ethical systems based on a single principle, such as utilitarianism. Instead, they acknowledge that human morality encompasses various principles that may need to be balanced against one another in complex ways. 6. The Role of Reason: While intuitionists emphasize the role of intuition in moral cognition, they do not completely discard the role of reason. Reason is considered necessary for reflecting upon, systematizing, and applying moral intuitions to particular cases, especially when intuitions about different principles conflict. 7. Critiques of Relativism and Subjectivism: Intuitionism stands opposed to moral relativism (the idea that moral truths are relative to cultures or individuals) and subjectivism (the idea that moral judgments are merely expressions of personal preferences). Intuitionists argue that moral truths are not subject to these forms of variability. Historically, figures like Henry Sidgwick, G.E. Moore, and W.D. Ross are associated with intuitionism. G.E. Moore's \\"Principia Ethica,\\" in which he proposes the \\"open question argument,\\" and W.D. Ross's concept of \\"prima facie duties\\" are key texts and ideas within intuitionist ethical theory. Despite its strengths in providing an account of moral objectivity and validity, intuitionism has faced criticisms, particularly concerning the reliability and universality of moral intuitions, as well as challenges in resolving conflicts between differing intuitions."},{"prompt":"Discuss Kant's theory of \\"Duty for the make of duty\\"","completion":"Immanuel Kant, a pivotal figure in the history of philosophy, is known for his deontological approach to ethics, expressed in his seminal work \\"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals\\" among others. Central to his ethical theory is the concept of \\"duty for the sake of duty,\\" which embodies the idea that moral actions should be performed out of a sense of duty alone and not from any other motive, such as self-interest, emotion, or consequence. Here are the key aspects of Kant's view on performing duty for the sake of duty: 1. **Good Will and Moral Worth**: For Kant, the only thing that is good without qualification is a \\"good will.\\" The moral worth of an action does not lie in its effects or accomplishments but in the principle by which it is determined. Thus, an action has true moral worth only if it is done from duty. 2. **Duty and the Categorical Imperative**: Duty is the necessity of an action done out of respect for the law, according to Kant. The law he refers to is the moral law, which he famously formulates as the Categorical Imperative. The most well-known formulation of the Categorical Imperative is: \\"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\\" 3. **Autonomy and Self-Legislation**: Kant holds that rational beings have the capacity for autonomy, which means they can give themselves the moral law, rather than being driven by desires or external determinants. When we act from duty, we act from our understanding of what the moral law requires, effectively legislating the law for ourselves. 4. **Respect for Moral Law**: Acting from duty implies having respect for the moral law itself. It is not fear of punishment or a desire for a reward that motivates a dutiful action, but rather a recognition of the intrinsic rightness of following the moral law. 5. **Contrast with Inclination**: A central distinction in Kant's ethics is that between actions done from duty and those done from inclination. While actions in accordance with inclinations (such as sympathy or self-interest) might align with what duty requires, they lack moral worth unless the motive is respect for the law. When we act from inclination, we are not acting freely in the Kantian sense, but are instead being controlled by the impulses of our nature. 6. **Universality and Impartiality**: Since actions motivated by duty are done with the intention of adhering to a universal law, they inherently possess a kind of impartiality. We cannot make exceptions for ourselves under the rules we recognize as universally binding. Kant's emphasis on the motive of duty serves to highlight the internal quality of moral actions rather than their external manifestation. Despite the potential for overlap between dutiful actions and actions prompted by inclination (such as helping others), it is the motivation of duty that confers genuine moral value upon the action in the eyes of Kant. Kant's stringent principle of \\"duty for the sake of duty\\" has been both highly influential and controversial. Critics argue that it might lead to a rigid and cold application of moral rules, ignoring the complexities of human situations and relationships.

It was a subtle background noise that he’d grown used to . Lily was finally five months old , and possessing the strength and vitality of the median three month old child. A milestone in itself. Or , at least it seemed that way, considering she’d been born a month early, and all the staff kept commenting on the improbable nature of her thriving. But when she did, she thrived harder than any kid he’d seen. “My bean is now a little cucumber.” he commented as he admired how far she’d progressed, and she unleashed a laugh into the air. Max gave a chuckle as his readjusted the squirming Lily in his lap. “Finally, we’re going home , all the way back to California. And Mr bear her gets the aisle seat , huh?” Max winked at Lily, her entire face lighting up with the promise of a jovial, healthy day, with her respiration having the all clear and her eyes sparkling with life. It was a stark comparison to her first days . \\"Laugh away bean, the sound is glorious, I bet it could actually cure some cancer, send some kids home\\" . He was only half joking , with the NICU being the sterile environment that it was, with no glimmers of optimism or joy. “Ah, you don’t know where you are anyway, of course you’ll be happy enough in this place”. Max contemplated how her age made it all so simple. “You’ll be just fine while your old man here tends to some boring adult chores. I gotta was my clothes…pack my attire and dry clean that one shirt you vomited on. “ Max meandered before typing a reminder into his phone . “Call Stanford . I’ll have to resume my degree when we get home. Daddy’s been so busy with your health issues he forgot about college.” “And Elara… it’s not as if I don’t think about her, and how I walked away from her. Am I the asshole, leaving her well she seemed so torn? It doesn’t matter , because it’s you and me kiddo, and that’s all there is to it. “ Her next laugh rang out through the metallic halls , attracting the appreciative smiles of passing medical staff who called out as they steered antiseptic disposal bins, \\"ah, what a beautiful laugh , Miss Hawthorne!\\" Came a blustering voice, and the moment was a welcome change of pace. Max, propping her up on his lap, gently lifted her hand, guiding it in a wave that resembled the playful twist of a light bulb being screwed in . \\"Wave , princess, you have admirers it seems. Got some big shoes to fill huh? “ Letting her arm fall back to her side, she flailed in excitement, grabbing at his shirt and scrunching it in her grasp. “You’re really perking up, I waited so long for this…” . As his phone lit up with discharge instructions and digital flyers from various social service links , bombarding his eyes with all the information. It was an hour’s drive to the airport, and his mind drifted to his earlier wrestle with Lily’s car seat. At least it was roadworthy, if a little askew , her blanket stuffed into place so she’d be warm enough. Then the outstretched list of medications he needed to collect from the pharmacy gnawed at his fidgeting hands , as he turned his focus back to his overstimulated daughter, begging for his attention with her every manoeuvre. “Alright, alright, that’s enough outta you, wriggler.” His own laughter sprinkled over hers , interspersed and forming a harmonious sound that reverberated on the metal walls. Finally , he answered an incoming call from Sam, “Hey man, how’ve you been? Yeah , saw the photos , I’m happy for you all , man. Yeah she’s being discharged in a couple of days. Nah, can’t get my head around it either. But the day is nearly here . I’m glad to hear James and Maddy are doing so well.

The \\"three am bustle\\" of the hospital has become white noise to him, a testament to the resilience and adaptation he's developed over the last five months. Lily, once fragile and fighting for life, is now a beacon of progress, her laughs providing a rare melody of joy in the usually sterile and tense NICU environment. Her vitality and the hope of returning home to California bring a semblance of normalcy to Max's life, which has been on hold. The bittersweet reality of resuming his own life, returning to college, and tending to everyday tasks like laundry, packing, and dealing with the remnants of Lily's earlier struggles (like cleaning a vomited-on shirt), are interwoven with the internal conflict he feels about leaving Elara. The mix of personal reflections, logistical planning, and the mundane details of preparing for discharge from the hospital creates an authentic glimpse into the life of a parent navigating the aftermath of critical healthcare. Max's life is filled with call reminders, medication lists, and car seat adjustments, yet these are punctuated by the pure expressions of Lily's developing personality and her interaction with the staff around her. The passage ends on a hopeful note, with an incoming call from Sam who appears to be checking-in and updating Max on others in their shared circle of friends or family. This conversation underscores the interconnectedness of life's experiences, with Sam's news about James and Maddy, and Max sharing about Lily's imminent discharge. It's a snapshot of shared human experiences, the intimate moments of connection, and the support networks that form around us in times of need."},{"prompt":"How to check bandwidth between 2 windows 10 hosts in a local network?","completion":"To check the bandwidth between two Windows 10 hosts on a local network, you can use a variety of methods. Below I outline a method using the built-in Windows tool \`iperf3\` and a method using PowerShell. # Method 1: Using iperf3 \`iperf3\` is a popular network testing tool that can measure bandwidth between two hosts. It's not included in Windows by default, but you can download it from the official source or a trusted repository. Here's how to use it: 1. **Download iperf3**: Go to the official iperf3 webpage or a trusted site to download the binaries for Windows (https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php#). 2. **Prepare the hosts**: Copy the \`iperf3\` binaries to both the \\"server\\" and the \\"client\\" hosts. 3. **Run iperf3 in server mode** on one of the hosts: Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you put \`iperf3\`. Then start \`iperf3\` in server mode: \`\`\` iperf3 -s \`\`\` 4. **Run iperf3 in client mode** on the other host: Open Command Prompt on the client host, navigate to the \`iperf3\` directory, and run the following command, replacing \`<server_ip>\` with the local IP address of the host running \`iperf3\` in server mode: \`\`\` iperf3 -c <server_ip> \`\`\` Optionally, you can specify the duration of the test with the \`-t\` flag and the parallel streams with the \`-P\` flag to simulate multiple connections and check how the network handles them: \`\`\` iperf3 -c <server_ip> -t 30 -P 4 \`\`\` Where \`-t 30\` specifies a 30-second test and \`-P 4\` specifies 4 parallel streams. 5. **Review the results**: After the test runs, \`iperf3\` will display the bandwidth measurements on both the server and client sides. # Method 2: Using PowerShell (requires a bit more manual work) 1. **Share a large file** from the first Windows 10 host: - You can create a shared folder and place a large file inside it or use an existing large file if you already have one. 2. **Map the network drive** or access the shared folder on the second Windows 10 host. 3. **Copy the large file** from first host to the second host using File Explorer or a PowerShell command: \`\`\`powershell Copy-Item \\"FirstHostIPSharedFolderLargeFile.ext\\" \\"C:TargetFolder\\" \`\`\` 4. **Monitor the transfer rate**: - You can monitor the network transfer in real-time using Task Manager → Performance → Ethernet/Wi-Fi (depending on your network connection). - Keep note of the average speed that is displayed in the Task Manager while the file is being transferred. This method is less accurate and depends on various factors such as disk read/write speed and network traffic, but can give you a rough estimate of the bandwidth. To get precise measurements, it would be better to use a tool like \`iperf3\` as described in the first method."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

Mrsquid에 업로드되는 음악들이 대개 그런 장르들이기 때문이다. 마침 정우담도 겨우 신주놀 출연자들을 납득시킬 장르를 떠올렸다. “Eat You Up 같은 유로댄스는요?” 출연자들의 눈이 오늘 본 것 중 가장 커진다. “젊은데 잇유업을 아시네요?” “런던보이즈가 유로댄스 맞지?” 다행히 그들이 환장하는 장르였다. 안도한 우담은 싱코페이션으로 드럼 박자를 당기고, 퍼커션과 스트링을 복고풍으로 재현한 뒤 들려주었다. “아직 1차 데모라 완벽하진 않지만.” 쿵 짝 쿵 짝 쿵 짝 쿵 짝 쿵 짝. 하지만 출연자들의 마음은 기운 상태였다. “오! 좋다!” “저희가 바라는 게 이거였어요!” 뜨거운 반응. 곧 메인 사회자가 주섬주섬 꺼낸 초대장을 내민다. “우담 씨, 가요제에 나오시겠습니까?” 괴물 같은 작업 속도로 분량을 확보한 우담은 부끄러워하며 답했다. “잘 부탁드립니다.” 그러자 예능 특유의 과장된 환호가 터진다. 그렇게 MNS 엔터를 나온 출연자들. 그중 가수 출신의 멤버는 여전히 카메라가 돌아가는데 다른 생각을 하고 있었다. ‘가요제 끝나면 나도 곡 하나만 달라고 할까?’ 음원 발매 욕심이 자라났다. 욕심을 내는 사람은 그 외에 또 있었다. 리우였다. 신주놀 팀이 떠나고 작업실 문은 굳게 닫혔다. 사옥 내의 구경꾼들은 전원 해산했다. 리우만 발이 떨어지지 않았다. 정우담이 오늘 만들었던 곡 가운데, 가능하다면 하나 받고 싶었다. 그는 얼터너티브 R&B 아티스트다. 출연자들은 패스했던, 정우담이 들려준 3곡 중 첫 번째 트랙에 강하게 꽂혔다. ‘가요제에서 안 쓸 거면 내가 사도 되지 않아?’ MNS 엔터가 곡비를 주지 않는다면 리우가 아끼는 각그렌저를 팔아서라도 살 생각이었다. * 정우담은 Mrsquid 직원들과 작업실 인터뷰를 마치고 국뽕 컨텐츠 촬영을 시작했다. 우담이 직접 찍는 건 아니다. MNS 엔터의 컨텐츠팀이 붙었다. “한국인이어도 한정식 수라상을 먹을 기회는 좀처럼 없어요. 저도 처음 먹으러 가요.” 통역가가 우담의 이야길 전해주고, 조지는 수라상이 뭐냐고 또 통역가를 통해 대화했다. “임금님이 드시던 밥상이요.” “King!” “소고기도 엄선된 걸로 식탁에 올라와요.” “소 거기?” “소 거기가 아니라, 소고기.” 유명 한정식 식당에 도착할 때까지도 소고기 발음을 고쳐주었다. 촬영 협조도 미리 구해놓았고, 모든 테이블이 개별실로 마련돼 있어 차분히 맛을 음미할 수 있을 터였다. “육즙이 쥬시.” 그러나 우담이 먹방 유튜버들처럼 맛 평가 좀 하려는데, 가게 사장이 계속 찾아왔다. 사장은 정우담을 몰랐으나, 종업원들이 누구인지 알려주는 바람에 개별실을 닫을 새도 없이 들락날락하게 된 것이다. “우리 한식을 널리 알려주셔서 고맙습니다. 이건 서비스예요.” “아, 감사합니다.” 1분도 안 지나서 또. “저, 입맛엔 맞으신가요? 이건 단골분들 오실 때나 드리는 건데.” “잘 먹겠습니다.” “산낙지도 드시나?” 끝도 없이 퍼주는 한국인의 정. Mrsquid 직원들은 음식이 목까지 차올라 괴로워했다. “돈두댓. WD, 플리즈. 스탑.” 그 후 한강에서 치맥도 하고, 정우담은 숙소로 복귀했다. “비활동기인데도 바쁘네.” 오히려 그편이 좋다. 돈이 벌리는 거니까. 내일은 일본 리듬게임 회사와 미팅하고, Mrsquid 직원들과 전통시장 탐방도 가기로 했다. 숙소에 오자마자 우담은 나무 가방을 들여다보았다. 안에서 빛이 번쩍번쩍 난다. 치지직. 치지직. “그래서 용접기 산 거야?” 나무로 만들었다가 금세 박살 난 그네를, 철근으로 제작하는 곰돌이들을 볼 수 있었다. 그뿐 아니라 정글짐까지. 놀이터가 만들어졌다.","completion":"< Eurodance > It was before the cast and crew of the weekend late-night variety show \\"ShinjuNol\\" headed to MNS Entertainment. \\"Everyone! The music festival is about to start!\\" The shooting began on an indoor set. The five regular members, among them the main host, discussed who else to invite as guests. The music festival, held quarterly, was happening too often and was becoming a problem. Of course, the guest lineup was already decided, but due to the nature of variety shows, they had to create content as if they were just now trying to recruit guests. \\"How about that person? The hitmaker of the 2000s.\\" \\"I know a band member who told me to call them if there's a music festival.\\" There were also talented ballad singers and rappers, female singer-songwriters, and so on. Then, one of the cast members exclaimed, \\"Ah!\\" \\"How about Woo-dam?\\" \\"Who?\\" \\"He's really hot these days.\\" The cast members looked him up. \\"He was a vocal coach and an indie composer until recently, then he applied when MNS Entertainment was looking for demos, right? There were 140 demos?!\\" \\"So he got picked out of that competition and signed with MNS Entertainment?\\" \\"Zion is preparing for a comeback with his song, and the girl group song that's always on the charts these days is also Woo-dam's.\\" He even debuted as a singer himself. \\"His music ranking is really high too. 24th, 31st, 33rd. It says in the interview that he uploads free music on YouTube, but why are there only music videos?\\" \\"Try searching for 'WD'.\\" \\"Is this it? The one with 16 million and 5 million views?\\" \\"...Crazy.\\" They had only heard rumors about who was being considered. They found out the detailed figures by searching themselves, realizing that Jeong Woo-dam wasn't just a new face they had to find for the show. 'Other new faces blew up after appearing on ShinjuNol, but isn't this person already famous?' It's not easy to get on the music charts these days. The entertainment industry is a place where one can shine brightly and then disappear, but it didn't seem like he would be a one-hit wonder. All three of his songs were charting, and Day.G's title track was even higher. \\"But if he's a rookie, won't he be intimidated by us? He has to learn our songs too.\\" Then the PD boasted about being well-informed in the industry. \\"I've heard this too, he's preparing to transform into a producer.\\" How much talent does one have to have to become a producer as well? He was a true cheat character. The cast members could almost hear the sound of the ratings rising as they got up from their seats. That's how they ended up with an opening act and came to MNS Entertainment. Buzzing. The arrival of the popular variety team gathered all the trainees. They were watching from a distance. \\"...There must be over 30 cameras?\\" \\"Wow, there are so many staff members.\\" \\"They came to see Jeong Woo-dam, right?\\" \\"Amazing, on ShinjuNol just a week after debut?\\" Among the trainees were the vocal group debutants Shin Chae-yoon and Kim Da-bin. They were still awkward with each other. It couldn't be helped. Shin Chae-yoon had just joined MNS. But Kim Da-bin tried to become friends. \\"Eh, I thought you wouldn't come to the shooting because you have a cool image.\\" \\"Is that my image?\\" \\"You can speak informally to me.\\" \\"I'll try, but I'm not very sociable.\\" \\"Actually, me too...\\" It seemed like a group that would be extremely shy was about to debut. Behind them, an exclamation erupted. \\"Wow! As expected from Woo-dam hyung!\\" Shin Chae-yoon turned her head in surprise. '...Who?' She knew Seo Ji-an because she was famous, but she didn't know the other MNS artists. She had signed to become a vocal group just because of Jeong Woo-dam. On the other hand, Kim Da-bin quickly greeted him. \\"Hello! Senior Rio!\\" Rio congratulated them on becoming debutants and moved closer behind the filming staff. There were even foreigners in the studio. 'I'm envious. How can I get a song from Woo-dam hyung?' And he just laughed like a spectator at the conversation of the ShinjuNol cast members inside the studio. * Jeong Woo-dam officially dived into the variety show after exchanging greetings with the cast members while wearing a lapel mic. 'I can't believe I'm on ShinjuNol.' He was truly moved, having only seen the edited videos on TV and YouTube. The main host asked about the foreigners with Jeong Woo-dam. \\"Are those people fellow composers?\\" \\"They are employees of the YouTube channel that uploads my free music.\\" \\"Oh! The one with ten million subscribers, Mr. Squid?\\" After getting some content about Jeong Woo-dam working with a well-known overseas channel, the focus returned to him. \\"We've done our research on you, Woo-dam, but the viewers might not recognize you when the show airs.\\" \\"I'll do my best.\\" \\"That's not what I mean. You're a participant who will shine at the music festival. Can you show us now?\\" \\"How?\\" \\"Can you do an exciting dance song?\\" They were asking if he could demonstrate his work on the spot, but composing isn't something that starts so easily. There are many steps to writing a song. First, inspiration must come, then decide whether it's major or minor, choose a theme and genre, set the tempo, and then write down the beat or chords. In other words, it was an unreasonable request for a composer. It was like asking an actor to perform on the spot or a comedian to make someone laugh in one second. However, some respond to such unreasonable requests with high quality. Jeong Woo-dam was one of those people. \\"How about alternative R&B for a dance song?\\" The ShinjuNol music festival consists of five stages to match the number of performers. However, not all the songs were meant to be exciting. Half of them were meant to make people bounce, while the other half were complex. The composers being invited didn't necessarily have to make exciting music just because it was a variety show. They would emphasize music and artistry that they don't usually do. Naturally, they thought Jeong Woo-dam, a notable newcomer, would be arrogant. They were slightly worried he would be stubborn like a previous new face artist who had a meeting with them and insisted on his own philosophy. However, Jeong Woo-dam prioritized having fun together and left the choice to the cast members. \\"Alternative, like The Weeknd's style?\\" The Mrsquid employees, who had been standing like statues, felt proud to hear the name of the Canadian singer mentioned on a Korean TV show. Soon, however, their attention was stolen by Jeong Woo-dam, who was quickly filling the track. Tap, tap, tadadak, tap, tadak. The sound of Woo-dam rapidly hitting the master keyboard and clicking the mouse was like a percussion rhythm. 'What the...?' They had uploaded Woo-dam's free music to their channel but had never seen him work. It wasn't just them. The PD and production team who had the meeting were also murmuring. \\"...Is composing usually that easy?\\" \\"Would it be easy? Then everyone would be a composer.\\" Despite that, Woo-dam was so focused that he didn't seem to hear the conversations around him, and he even muttered to himself like the geniuses in movies. \\"Layer the synth lead with pads, and double the kick.\\" Then, just a few minutes after starting the MIDI, he copied and pasted the 4-bar intro he created into a 3-minute length. \\"Let's play it.\\" \\"It's done already?\\" Tap. As Woo-dam pressed the spacebar, a dark and heavy bass sound filled the room, and the clapping sound of claps made everyone naturally follow the rhythm. People forgot to blink. A cast member, almost forgetting they were filming, spoke up. \\"It's good, but can you increase the BPM?\\" It was an inevitable request. The game was over with a song completed in just 5 minutes. 'This song could top the music festival charts, but we won't have enough content if it's done in 3 minutes like fast food.' They were surprised. Everyone in the studio. Even those who were watching from outside. 'Had I heard he writes songs quickly, but to this extent? 'It's like he's practicing typing.' 'Did he prepare in advance knowing he was coming to ShinjuNol? Otherwise, how?' While people were still in shock, Jeong Woo-dam was pondering. 'They want me to raise the BPM.' Tempo can feel faster by subdividing the beats. But the cast members might want a crazy BPM without the need to subdivide, so Woo-dam decided to create a different genre for them. \\"How about dubstep?\\" As he asked, his hands moved again. Five minutes later, another track was quickly produced. But this time, it was a matter of taste. If anyone had heard a Skrillex song even once, they couldn't doubt the high quality, but it was unfamiliar and difficult for the cast members who didn't usually listen to that genre. \\"It's too chaotic, and it won't be easy to add vocals, right?\\" It was rejected again. On the other hand, George, who was listening to their conversation through an interpreter, thought he had struck gold. 'WD said he would give me the third Kawaii Bass soon.' He had agreed to send <Yagumyagum> after replacing the real gayageum sound with a virtual instrument. But not only Kawaii Bass, but he also wanted the dubstep track that Woo-dam had just finished. Because those were the genres usually uploaded to Mrsquid. Just then, Jeong Woo-dam finally thought of a genre that would satisfy the ShinjuNol cast members. \\"How about Eurodance, like 'Eat You Up'?\\" The cast members' eyes widened the most they had all day. \\"You're young, but you know 'Eat You Up'?\\" \\"London Boys are Eurodance, right?\\" Fortunately, it was a genre they were crazy about. Relieved, Woo-dam recreated the drums with syncopation, added percussion and strings in a retro style, and played it for them. \\"It's still a first demo, so it's not perfect.\\" Boom clap boom clap boom clap boom clap. But the cast members were already energized. \\"Oh! It's good!\\" \\"This is what we wanted!\\" They reacted warmly. Soon, the main host clumsily handed out an invitation. \\"Woo-dam, will you participate in the music festival?\\" Woo-dam, who had secured content with his monstrous work speed, replied shyly. \\"Please take care of me.\\" Then, the exaggerated cheers typical of variety shows erupted. That's how the cast members left MNS Entertainment. Among them, a member who was a singer was still thinking while the camera was rolling. 'Should I ask for a song after the music festival?' His desire to release a song grew. There was someone else who was greedy. It was Rio. After the ShinjuNol team left, the studio door closed tightly. All the onlookers inside the building dispersed. Only Rio's feet wouldn't move. He wanted one of the songs Jeong Woo-dam had made today, if possible. He was an alternative R&B artist. The cast members had passed on the first track of the three songs Woo-dam had played, but Rio was strongly attracted to it. 'If they're not going to use it for the music festival, can't I buy it?' If MNS Entertainment wouldn't pay for the song, Rio was willing to sell his cherished Gretsch guitar to buy it. * Jeong Woo-dam finished the studio interview with the Mrsquid employees and started filming the national pride content. Woo-dam wasn't filming it himself. MNS Entertainment's content team was attached. \\"Even as a Korean, I rarely have the chance to eat a full-course Korean meal. It's my first time going to eat one.\\" The interpreter conveyed Woo-dam's words, and George asked through the interpreter what a full-course meal was. \\"It's the meal that the king used to eat.\\" \\"King!\\" \\"The beef is also carefully selected for the table.\\" \\"Beef there?\\" \\"Not 'beef there,' beef.\\" They continued to correct the pronunciation of beef until they arrived at the famous Korean restaurant. The filming cooperation was already arranged, and each table was set up in a private room, so they could calmly savor the taste. \\"The meat juice is juicy.\\" However, as Woo-dam tried to give a taste evaluation like a food YouTuber, the restaurant owner kept coming by. The owner didn't know Jeong Woo-dam, but the employees told him who he was, so he kept coming in and out without being able to close the private room. \\"Thank you for spreading our Korean food. This is on the house.\\" \\"Ah, thank you.\\" Not even a minute later. \\"Do you like the taste? This is something we only give to regular customers.\\" \\"I'll enjoy it.\\" \\"Do you eat live octopus?\\" The endless generosity of Koreans. The Mrsquid employees were so full they were in pain. \\"Don't do that. WD, please. Stop.\\" Afterward, they had chicken and beer by the Han River, and Jeong Woo-dam returned to his accommodation. \\"It's busy even during the off-season.\\" But that was better. It meant money was being made. Tomorrow, he had a meeting with a Japanese rhythm game company, and he was also going to explore a traditional market with the Mrsquid employees. As soon as he arrived at the accommodation, Woo-dam looked into the wooden box. There was a flashing light inside. Zzzt. Zzzt. \\"So you bought a welding machine?\\" He could see bears making a swing out of steel bars, which had been quickly destroyed when made of wood. Not only that, but a jungle gym as well. A playground had been created."},{"prompt":"< 1위 후보 > 서지안은 정우담의 황당한 계획에 응원을 건넸다. “열심히 해봐. 근데, 방법을 잘 찾아야 할 거다.” “방법?” “나보단 전무님이 잘 설명해주시겠지. 간다. 난 내 전담팀으로, 넌 네 전담팀으로.” 뒤돌아 손 흔들며 가는 서지안. 그녀가 남긴 의미심장한 말에 정우담은 고개를 갸웃하곤 맞은편의 사무실로 들어갔다. “성공적인 데뷔 활동 마무리, 축하드려요!” “음원 어디까지 올라갈지 모르겠던데요? 이러다 10위까지?” 직원들이 너도나도 축하와 응원을 건네고, 우담은 일일이 고개 숙여 인사하며 미적 감각이 의심스러운 장식품이 잔뜩 올려진 책상으로 걸어갔다. 그러자 꼬불거리는 긴 머리에 럭셔리와 구제가 섞인 옷차림의 전무가 일어나 맞이해준다. “상의할 게 있으시다고요?” 미리 시간 되시냐고 연락했었다. 다른 일이 있는데 들이닥치면 안 되니까. “저 월간 정우담을 해볼까 합니다.” “월간 정우담이라는 게?” “음악방송에서 컴백을 매달, 1년에 12번 할 수 있을까요?” 우담의 폭탄선언에, 가까운 자리의 이규성 과장이 마시던 아이스 아메리카노를 거하게 뿜었다. “푸웁! 켁, 켁.” 커피를 뿜은 건 이규성뿐이었지만, 사무실 내의 모두가 하나같이 같은 반응이었다. 제대로 들은 게 맞느냐는. ‘착한 인상에 맑은 눈으로 이 무슨 광기 어린 발언을.’ ‘의심의 여지가 없는 노래, 작곡 천재지만 아무래도 신인이시니 아직 이 바닥을 잘 모르실 수 있어.’ 무시가 아니다. 무리인 것이다. 간혹 이렇게 의욕이 넘쳐 무리한 플랜을 말하는 아티스트들이 있다. 리우의 경우 평범한 뮤직비디오는 넘쳐난다며, 스카이다이빙하면서 노래를 부르는 걸 원테이크로 찍어 올리자고도 했었다. 안전상의 이유로 회의에도 올리지 않았다. 그래도 이들은 정우담 전담팀. 남들이 다 안 된다 해도 어떻게든 되게끔, 일사불란하게 타 아티스트들의 사례를 찾고 아이디어를 취합했다. 직원들이 그러는 사이. 전무는 정우담의 상태부터 살피며 물었다. “우담 씨, 왜 갑자기 월간 정우담을 생각해내셨는지 여쭤봐도 될까요?” “인기를 끌고 싶습니다. 콘서트를 하면 사람들이 오게, 그리고 콘서트를 하려면 곡이 많아야 하잖아요.” 이해한다. 신인들이 많이 겪는 증상이다. 바쁘게 데뷔를 준비했는데, 깨닫고 보니 활동이 끝나있다. ‘비활동기란 휴식기를 맞이하면 불안해지고.’ 가족을 보고 친구도 만나라고 시간이 주어지지만, 팬들이 다른 아티스트에게 넘어갈까 봐 진정이 안 된다. 때문에 뭐라도 해야 할 듯해 일거릴 찾는다. 무엇보다, 틀린 말도 아니었다. 가수는 당연히 공연을 목적으로 삼게 된다. 오로지 자신만의 팬으로 채워지는 공연장. 그보다 가수가 된 데에 뿌듯해질 일이 있을까? ‘그래서 요새 인기 아이돌들은 데뷔 2년 차부터 콘서트 돌리지. 아예 미니 콘서트처럼 팬미팅은 2년 차가 되기 전에도 하고.’ 물론, 대형기획사는 그게 가능하다. 데뷔 소식과 함께 팬층이 바로 생긴다. 아이돌 명가, 대형기획사란 기대감이 있으니. 그렇다고 우담에게 먼 이야기라는 것도 아니다. 공연장은 규모가 천차만별이니 말이다. MNS 엔터도 이 추세면 우담이 내년부터, 2천 석 3일 공연은 가뿐히 채우고도 남을 거라 보고 있다. 결과에 따라 그 이상이 될지도 모르고. 하지만, 안 되는 걸 되게 해주고 싶어도 매달 음악방송 컴백은 진짜 안 되는 거였다. 그럼에도 전무는 정우담의 생각을 최대한 실현시킬 방법론을 제시했다. “매달 음방 컴백은 솔직히 리스크가 커요. 우담 씨라면 그래도 성과를 낼 수 있으리라 봅니다만 일단, 방송사가 허락을 안 해줘요.” “헐.” 그제야 정우담은 왜 서지안이 방법을 찾아야 할 거라고 말했는지 이해했다. 음악방송도 시청률에 따라 광고가 붙는다. 시청률이 잘 나오게 무대를 구성해야 한다. 반복적인 출연자보단, 몇 개월에 한 번씩 출연해줘야 화제가 잡히고 그래야 시청률이 나온다. 전무는 말을 이었다. “월간 정우담 비슷하게는 할 수 있습니다. 앨범 내기 전에 선공개로 활동하고 나서 정식 컴백 을 하면 돼요. 또는 타이틀부터 하고 후속곡 활동을 하거나.” 전무의 이야기는 끝나지 않았다. “1년에 이렇게 하면 4번 활동이 채워지죠? 팬들한테도 그게 딱 좋고요. 그리고 남은 8번 중 4번은 대타를 적극 활용하는 겁니다.” “대타요?” “타 아티스트 프로듀싱이요. 채윤 씨 보컬 그룹을 프로듀싱하는 거랑 다른 의미로, 단일 음원에 한해서요. 업타운펑크처럼.” 업타운펑크 하면 호랑이 방문 상단부터 떠오르게 된 정우담이었지만, 전무의 설명을 계속 들었다. “브루노 마스 곡인 줄 알지만, 실은 마크 론슨 곡이잖아요. 근데 한국에선 익숙지 않은 개념이라, 아티스트명이 아닌 제목에 우담 씨가 Prod.로 들어갈 겁니다.” “콜라보레이션이군요?” “네. 피처링을 넣더라도 무대는 하지 맙시다. AR로 대체하면 돼요. 음방을 생각하면 이게 최선입니다. 한국에선요.” “한국에선요?” 전무는 전에 했던 말을 재차 꺼냈다. “무대를 넓혀보자던 얘기, 기억하시죠? 해외 진출까지 한다면 1년에 12곡 활동은 껌이에요.” 실제로 소처럼 일한다는 아이돌들은 한국에서 안 보이면 일본에 가 있고, 또 미국에 가 있기도 하다. 그밖에 다른 나라들까지. 한국 싱글로 해외 활동을 하거나, 해외전용 활동곡을 따로 내거나. ‘내가 해외 진출을?’ 정우담은 안 된다면 다른 방법을 찾아보려 했지만, 전무와 전담팀이 상세한 프로세스를 짜주니 감탄하지 않을 수 없었다. “이렇게 해야 월간 정우담이 가능합니다. 드라마 OST와 광고 CM송도 간간이 내고요.” “그런데 해외는 반응이 있어야 갈 수 있지 않나요? OST는 어떤 식으로 의뢰가 오가나요?” “OST는 저희가 물어다 드리면 되고, 일본은 당장에라도 진출할 수 있습니다. 미나미 씨가 소속사에 우담 씨 얘기를 많이 해서, 그쪽에서 계약 제의도 왔어요.” 그 회사에 대해 조사부터 해보고 알려주려 아직 정우담에겐 말을 하기 전이었다. “당장 진출이라면, Go겠군요?” “일본은 밴드가 강세라, 우담 씨의 원맨 밴드 곡인 Go가 특히 반응이 좋으니까요. 일본 데뷔 음반엔 Go를 꼭 넣어야 할 겁니다.” “신기하네요.” “미국과 유럽에선 Home이 잘나가고요.” 갑자기 글로벌이 되는 스케일. 물론, 한 곡씩 믿고 가기엔 정우담의 말대로 확실히 반응이 터진 뒤에 가는 편이 안전하다. 전무도 어디까지나 다달이 활동에 대한 방향성을 알려준 것이었다. “대신, 앞서 말한 일정을 소화하려면 몸이 남아나질 않을 겁니다. 괜찮으시겠어요?” 우담은 벽성산업을 오갈 때에 비하면 한가한 지금이 매우 낯설었다. 정 안 되면 체력 등급도 올리면 되고. “전 좋습니다.” 그에 전무가 입가를 올렸다. ‘MNS 엔터와 우담 씨는 윈윈 관계의 파트너쉽을 맺은 거지만.’ 현재는 MNS 엔터가 더 그의 곡 창작력에 의지하고 있다. 보컬 그룹의 프로듀싱을 부탁한 것만 봐도 그렇다. 그런데 비로소 파트너답게 함께 계획을 세웠다. “그러시면 우선, 콜라보부터 얘기해볼까요? 먼저 제의가 들어온 쪽은 체인어스의 작곡 멤버지만, 우담 씨가 하고 싶은 분과 해도 됩니다.” * 전담팀과 미팅을 하고, 일본 게임사와 <하모하모> 라이센스 계약을 체결한 뒤. 정우담은 컨텐츠팀과 합류해 Mrsquid를 픽업하고 한국 시장을 탐방했다. “뻑 예아!” 욕설은 편집되겠지만, 조지는 고급 한정식을 먹을 때보다 소머리 국밥에 더 열광했다. “조지, 석박지 국물도 넣어봐요. 시원해져요.” “예아! 썩박지!” 국밥에 육회도 한 그릇 조진 조지는 동료들과 만족스레 배를 두드리며, 공항행 버스에 올랐다. “씨유! WD!” “바이.” 그들을 보내고 나자, 컨텐츠팀이 할 말이 있었다며 운을 뗀다. “우담 씨, 국밥에 김칫국물 넣어요?” “안 넣으세요?” “전 절대. 이제 어디 가요?” “촬영 끝난 거 아니에요?” 물음표 지옥인 대화. 결국 정우담을 따라 컨텐츠팀은 가야금을 판매하는 국악기 공방으로 향했다. 가격을 듣고 놀랐다. 한국의 전통 악기라 놀라는 게 실례 같았지만, 그만큼 비쌌다. “165만 원입니다.” 놀라긴 정우담도 마찬가지였다. ‘인터넷에서 봤던 모델은 아니긴 한데.’ 인터넷에서 본 100만 원짜리도 연주용이라고 했지만, 지금 눈앞에 둔 25현 가야금은 토종나무를 5년 건조해 제작했다고 한다. 심지어 30년 된 나무로 만들어진 가야금은 천만 원이라 감히 만져볼 수도 없었다. 끝내. “이걸로 하겠습니다.” 플렉스 하는 기분으로 165만 원을 결제했다. “부자시다.” “가야금은 어디에 쓰시게요?” “제 채널이랑 Mrsquid에 업로드할 신곡 메인이 가야금이에요.” “전엔 리코더랑 하모니카 썼죠? 우담 씨 악기 박사시네요?” 컨텐츠팀과 부쩍 친해졌다. 케이스에 든 가야금을 들고 숙소로 돌아온 우담은 곰돌이들에게 복귀 신고를 했다. “오늘은 스케이트야?” 쌓였던 눈이 녹았다가 다시 얼면서 만들어진 빙판. 용접기가 생긴 곰돌이들은 철근을 이용해 스케이트와 썰매를 만들어 그 위에서 놀고 있었다. 카우보이 6웅은 스케이트용으로 휘게 만든 철근을 권총처럼 주머니에 꽂고, 꼬맹이 4웅이는 형들에게 환호를 들었다. -오. 꼬맹이가 몇 회전인지 세기도 힘들게 스핀을 돌고 있었기 때문이다. 휘리리리리리리릭. 그것도 아주 빠르게. ‘나였으면 토했을 거야.’ 그런데 꼬맹이는 아주 멀쩡했다. 재밌게 놀라며 작업실로 넘어간 우담은 마이크를 세팅해 가야금 소리를 넣었다. 교재도 받아왔고, 미리 유튜브를 시청하며 공부하긴 했어도 처음 치는 것이다. 디이잉. 디이잉. 디이잉. 하지만 그는 제법 능숙하게 가야금을 연주했다. 가야금 나무가 B등급인 덕분이다. ‘막연히 어려운 악기라고만 생각했는데.’ 처음엔 도전이었다. 카와이 베이스에 이런저런 악기를 접목해볼까 하고. 그러나 우담은 가야금으론, 없는 음까지 만들어낼 수 있는 걸 알게 되곤 <야금야금> 이후에도 간간이 쓸 일이 많아지겠다 생각했다. ‘농현이라고 한다면서?’ 음에 비브라토를 넣는 깊은 농현. 줄을 가지고 논다는 뜻으로 가야금 주법들엔 그런 표현이 붙는다. 탈 줄 몰라도 겁 없이 스케이트를 타고 노는 곰돌이들처럼, 우담도 서서히 농현을 이해해갔다. ‘의외로 재밌네, 가야금.’ 그렇게 다음 날. 캐나다로 돌아간 조지에게 <야금야금> 파일을 전송한 우담은 또 MNS 엔터에 갔다. 오늘은 신채윤과 김다빈의 트레이닝을 해주기로 했다. 거기에 다른 이유가 한 가지 더. ‘올해 말에 데뷔하니까, 결정을 내려야지.’ 3인조로 하루라도 빨리 팀워크를 갖춰나갈 수 있게 말이다. 그러자 사옥에서 정우담을 발견한 리우가 달려왔다. “우담 형님! 리우라고 합니다! 특기는 지!” 예전, 리우는 어느 유튜브 예능에 출연했었고, 이러다 통편집되겠단 생각에 뭐라도 하려 지건을 흉내냈었다. 그때 댓글로 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ가 도배됐었다. 때문에 그 후로 남들에게 인상을 남기고 싶을 때면 지건을, 세게는 아니고 살짝 팔뚝을 톡 찌르곤 했는데. 이내 비명을 지른다. 정우담이 가까워지는 리우의 검지를 잡고 꺾은 것이다. “아악!” “고무고무 용각산.” “그런 기술이 어딨어요!” 우담은 그의 검지를 풀어주면서 제안했다. “선배님, 얼터너티브 R&B 하시잖아요? 제 노래 하나 불러주실 수 있으세요?” “아유, 선배는요. 그보다 방금 뭐라고···?” “체인어스 멤버한테 콜라보 제의 왔다는데, 콜라보를 한다면 아무래도 아는 분이랑 했으면 해서요. 싫으시다면.” “시, 싫을 리가요!” *** 얼마 전까지 말년 병장이었던 강 씨. 제대 후 하루도 빠지지 않고 Day.G를 응원해주러 음악방송에 올 생각이었지만, 급격히 팬이 많아지면서 공개방송 추첨에서 탈락하는 일이 빈번해졌다. 그래도 오늘은 당첨됐다. 더구나 중요한 날이었다. Day.G가 오늘···. 1위 후보에 올랐다. “사랑해! 데이지! 날 가져!” “여러분, 들어가시면 개인멘트 금지예요.” 인기 아이돌들은 출연을 건너뛴다는 이곳, 케이블 음악방송은 1위 후보를 5팀씩 뽑는다. 보이그룹 한 팀에 정우담, 정우담, 그리고 정우담. 세 곡이 다 1위 후보에 든 것이다. 마지막 홍일점으로 Day.G까지. ‘제발 데이지한테 1위 주세요.’ 출연 안 하는 가수한텐 웬만해선 트로피를 안 주니 정우담은 받기 힘들 것이다. 무엇보다 세 곡이나 후보라 투표 점수가 분산된다. 보이그룹도 만만치 않은 상대지만, 이토록 한마음이 됐던 적 없을 만큼 팬들은 Day.G가 트로피를 받고 엉엉 우는 모습을 볼 수 있게 기도했다.","completion":"< Candidate for 1st Place > Seo Ji-an sent her support for Jeong Woo-dam's outrageous plan. \\"Give it your best shot. But you'll need to find the right way to do it.\\" \\"The right way?\\" \\"The executive director will explain it better than I can. I'm off to my dedicated team, and you should go to yours.\\" Seo Ji-an waved goodbye as she turned around. Pondering her meaningful words, Jeong Woo-dam headed to the office across the hall. \\"Congratulations on the successful conclusion of your debut activities!\\" \\"How high will the music chart go? Maybe up to 10th place?\\" Employees congratulated and cheered him on, and Woo-dam bowed his head in thanks as he walked to his desk, which was covered with questionably aesthetic decorations. Then, the executive director, with curly long hair and a mix of luxury and thrift store fashion, stood up to greet him. \\"Did you want to discuss something?\\" He had contacted her in advance to see if she was available. It wouldn't be good to barge in if she was busy with something else. \\"I'm thinking of doing 'Monthly Jeong Woo-dam.'\\" \\"What's 'Monthly Jeong Woo-dam'?\\" \\"Is it possible to have a comeback on music shows every month, 12 times a year?\\" At Woo-dam's bombshell announcement, nearby manager Lee Kyu-sung spit out his iced Americano in shock. \\"Pfft! Cough, cough.\\" Although only Lee Kyu-sung spat out his coffee, everyone in the office had the same reaction. They wondered if they had heard him correctly. 'With such a kind face and clear eyes, what kind of madness is this?' 'No doubt he's a genius in songwriting and composing, but as a newcomer, he might not yet understand how the industry works.' It wasn't that they were ignoring him. It was just too much. Sometimes artists overflow with enthusiasm and propose unrealistic plans. Like Rio, who once suggested filming a one-take music video while skydiving because ordinary music videos were too common. It was never brought up in meetings for safety reasons. But this was Jeong Woo-dam's dedicated team. Even if everyone else said it couldn't be done, they would find a way, gathering ideas and examples from other artists. While the employees were discussing, the executive director checked on Woo-dam's condition and asked. \\"Mr. Woo-dam, may I ask why you suddenly thought of 'Monthly Jeong Woo-dam'?\\" \\"I want to attract popularity. To get people to come to concerts, and to have concerts, I need a lot of songs.\\" She understood. It's a common symptom among newcomers. They prepare for their debut busily, and before they know it, their activities are over. 'When they face a break, they become anxious.' They are given time to see family and meet friends, but they can't settle down, fearing fans might move on to other artists. So they feel the need to do something, to find work. Above all, it wasn't wrong. Singers naturally aim for performances. A concert hall filled only with their fans. Could there be anything more gratifying for a singer? 'That's why popular idols start touring concerts from their second year. They even have fan meetings like mini-concerts before their second year.' Of course, large agencies can do that. They instantly gain a fan base with the news of their debut. There's an expectation for idol powerhouses, large agencies. But that didn't mean it was a distant story for Woo-dam. Concert venues come in all sizes. MNS Entertainment also believed that with this trend, Woo-dam could easily fill a 2,000-seat venue for three days starting next year. Depending on the results, it could be even more. However, even if they wanted to make it happen, a monthly music show comeback was truly impossible. Still, the executive director suggested a methodology to realize Woo-dam's idea as much as possible. \\"Honestly, a monthly music show comeback is risky. I believe you could still succeed, Mr. Woo-dam, but first of all, the broadcasters won't allow it.\\" \\"What?\\" Only then did Woo-dam understand why Seo Ji-an said he needed to find a way. Music shows also rely on ratings for advertising. They need to arrange performances that will bring in good ratings. Rather than repetitive appearances, it's better to appear every few months to create buzz and generate ratings. The executive director continued. \\"We can do something similar to 'Monthly Jeong Woo-dam.' You can start with pre-releases before the album and then have an official comeback. Or start with the title track and then promote follow-up songs.\\" The executive director's story wasn't over. \\"If you do this, you'll have four activities a year, right? That's perfect for the fans. And for the remaining eight times, four of them will actively use substitutes.\\" \\"Substitutes?\\" \\"Producing for other artists. Like producing for Shin Chae-yoon's vocal group, but in a different sense, just for single releases. Like 'Uptown Funk.'\\" Although Woo-dam was reminded of 'Uptown Funk' by Tiger Door, he continued to listen to the executive director's explanation. \\"You might think it's a Bruno Mars song, but it's actually Mark Ronson's. But it's an unfamiliar concept in Korea, so instead of the artist's name, your name will appear as Prod. in the title.\\" \\"Like a collaboration?\\" \\"Yes. Even if we add featuring, let's not perform on stage. We can replace it with AR. Considering music shows, this is the best option in Korea.\\" \\"In Korea?\\" The executive director repeated a previous conversation. \\"Remember what I said about expanding the stage? If you go international, 12 songs a year is a piece of cake.\\" In reality, idols who work like oxen are in Japan when they're not seen in Korea, and sometimes in the US, among other countries. They either promote Korean singles abroad or release exclusive songs for overseas activities. 'Me, going international?' Jeong Woo-dam had intended to find another way if it wasn't possible, but he couldn't help but be amazed by the detailed process laid out by the executive director and the dedicated team. \\"This is how 'Monthly Jeong Woo-dam' is possible. You'll also occasionally release drama OSTs and commercial CM songs.\\" \\"But don't you need a response to go abroad? How do OST requests work?\\" \\"We'll bring OST opportunities to you, and Japan is ready for you to enter the market right away. Ms. Minami has talked a lot about you to her agency, and they've even offered a contract.\\" They were still researching the company and hadn't yet informed Woo-dam. \\"So if it's immediate entry, it's 'Go,' right?\\" \\"Japan has a strong band scene, so your one-man band song 'Go' is especially well-received there. It's a must for your Japanese debut album.\\" \\"That's interesting.\\" \\"In the US and Europe, 'Home' is doing well.\\" Suddenly, the scale became global. Of course, as Woo-dam said, it's safer to go after a sure response has been triggered. The executive director was merely informing him of the direction for monthly activities. \\"However, to keep up with the schedule I mentioned earlier, you'll be exhausted. Are you sure you're okay with that?\\" Woo-dam found the current downtime very strange compared to when he was busy going back and forth to Wall City. If it didn't work out, he could just improve his stamina. \\"I'm fine with it.\\" The executive director smiled at his response. 'MNS Entertainment and Mr. Woo-dam have formed a win-win partnership.' Currently, MNS Entertainment relies more on his songwriting talent. They had even asked him to produce for the vocal group. But now they had finally planned together like true partners. \\"Then, shall we start by discussing collaborations? The first offer came from a composing member of ChainUs, but you can work with anyone you want. If you don't like it, that is.\\" \\"No, why would I dislike it!\\" *** Kang, who had been a senior soldier until recently, planned to support Day.G at music shows every day after his discharge, but as the fanbase grew rapidly, he often failed to win the public broadcast lottery. But today, he was lucky. It was an important day. Today... Day.G was a candidate for 1st place. \\"I love you, Daisy! Take me!\\" \\"Everyone, please refrain from personal comments once you enter.\\" This cable music show, where popular idols often skip appearances, selects five candidates for 1st place. One boy group, Jeong Woo-dam, Jeong Woo-dam, and Jeong Woo-dam. All three of his songs were candidates for 1st place. And Day.G was the last one standing. 'Please give 1st place to Daisy.' Since singers who don't appear usually don't get the trophy, it would be difficult for Jeong Woo-dam to win. Moreover, with three songs as candidates, the votes would be split. The boy group was also a formidable opponent, but the fans were more united than ever, praying that Day.G would receive the trophy and cry tears of joy."},{"prompt":"random story about england in 2 paragraphs","completion":"In the heart of England, nestled in the lush countryside, there was a quaint little village called Willowbrook. The village was known for its charming thatched-roof cottages, winding cobblestone streets, and vibrant community spirit. Every year, the villagers would come together to celebrate the annual May Day festival, where they would dance around the maypole, feast on traditional English fare, and partake in lively competitions like tug-of-war and egg-and-spoon races. One year, a mysterious traveler arrived in Willowbrook on the eve of the festival. He was a tall, dark-haired man dressed in a tattered cloak, and his piercing blue eyes seemed to hold secrets of a distant past. The villagers welcomed him with open arms, fascinated by his enigmatic aura. As the festivities began, the stranger surprised everyone with his extraordinary skills in the archery contest, hitting the bullseye with unmatched precision. Whispers spread through the crowd that he must be a skilled huntsman or perhaps even a noble in disguise.

The \`date\` block assumes the default system's locale is English; if not, you should specify the appropriate locale."},{"prompt":"Explain me how the configuration works please","completion":"Absolutely! Let's break down the Logstash configuration file I provided: # 1. Input Section \`\`\`ruby input { file { path => \\"/path/to/your/charon-logs.log\\" start_position => \\"beginning\\" } } \`\`\` In the \`input\` section, Logstash is configured to read logs from a file located at \`/path/to/your/charon-logs.log\`. The \`start_position => \\"beginning\\"\` directive tells Logstash to start reading from the beginning of the file. This is typically used when initially processing a previously-unread log file. # 2. Filter Section (Grok and Mutate Filters) \`\`\`ruby filter { grok { match => { \\"message\\" => \\"%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{INT:thread}[%{WORD:subsystem_abbr}] %{GREEDYDATA:description}\\" } } ... } \`\`\` The \`filter\` section contains processing instructions for transforming or manipulating the log data as it moves through the Logstash pipeline. - **Grok Filter**: The \`grok\` filter is used to parse the unstructured log messages into structured data. The \`match\` directive inside the \`grok\` filter provides one or more match patterns to parse the fields from the log line. In your example, we are capturing: - \`%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp}\`: The timestamp of the log event. - \`%{INT:thread}\`: The thread ID, placed immediately before the subsystem abbreviation (e.g., \\"00\\"). - \`%{WORD:subsystem_abbr}\`: The subsystem abbreviation (e.g., \\"DMN\\"). - \`%{GREEDYDATA:description}\`: The rest of the message, which is the description. \`\`\`ruby mutate { rename => { \\"subsystem_abbr\\" => \\"subsystem\\" } replace => { \\"subsystem\\" => \\"%{subsystem}\\" } gsub => [ ... ] ... } \`\`\` - **Mutate Filter**: The \`mutate\` filter is used for general mutations on fields. In this case: - \`rename\` changes the \`subsystem_abbr\` field to \`subsystem\` in preparation for applying the full name substitution. - \`replace\` seems unnecessary in this context and can be removed as it simply sets \`subsystem\` to itself. My apologies for earlier confusion. - \`gsub\` is used to replace matched patterns in a field with a new string. Here, it substitutes the subsystem abbreviations with their full names that you provided. # 3. Date Filter \`\`\`ruby date { match => [\\"timestamp\\", \\"MMM dd HH:mm:ss\\", \\"MMM d HH:mm:ss\\"] locale => \\"en\\" target => \\"@timestamp\\" } \`\`\` - **Date Filter**: The \`date\` filter is used to parse the date and time information from the \`timestamp\` field (as captured by \`grok\`) and overwrite the \`@timestamp\` field in our event (which by default is set to the time the event is processed by Logstash). This is crucial for correctly correlating the log event with the actual time it occurred. The \`locale\` directive tells Logstash which locale to use to interpret the date. The \`match\` directive includes two patterns to account for single-digit and double-digit days (note the two spaces in \`\\"MMM d HH:mm:ss\\"\` to handle single-digit days). # 4. Output Section \`\`\`ruby output { stdout { codec => rubydebug } } \`\`\` The \`output\` section determines what Logstash does with the data after it's been processed by the input and filter sections. Here, we have a simple \`stdout\` output, which will print the processed log data to the console in a Ruby debug format. This is useful for testing and debugging. In a production environment, you would likely send the output to another service, such as Elasticsearch, a monitoring platform, or store it in a file. To summarize, this Logstash configuration reads in StrongSwan's Charon log entries from a file, parses them to extract timestamp, subsystem, and description, applies transformation to rename the subsystem abbreviation to its full name, corrects the event timestamp, and prints the output to the console (or other configured output destination)."},{"prompt":"I got the following error : \\" Pipeline error {:pipeline_id=>\\"main\\", :exception=>#<TypeError: no implicit conversion of Array into String>, :backtrace=>[\\"org/jruby/RubyRegexp.java:963:in \`initialize'\\", \\"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/2.5.0/gems/logstash-filter-mutate-3.5.6/lib/logstash/filters/mutate.rb:244:in \`block in register'\\", \\"org/jruby/RubyArray.java:1863:in \`each_slice'\\", \\"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/2.5.0/gems/logstash-filter-mutate-3.5.6/lib/logstash/filters/mutate.rb:232:in \`register'\\", \\"org/logstash/config/ir/compiler/AbstractFilterDelegatorExt.java:75:in \`register'\\", \\"/usr/share/logstash/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb:232:in \`block in register_plugins'\\", \\"org/jruby/RubyArray.java:1821:in \`each'\\", \\"/usr/share/logstash/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb:231:in \`register_plugins'\\", \\"/usr/share/logstash/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb:590:in \`maybe_setup_out_plugins'\\", \\"/usr/share/logstash/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb:244:in \`start_workers'\\", \\"/usr/share/logstash/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb:189:in \`run'\\", \\"/usr/share/logstash/logstash-core/lib/logstash/java_pipeline.rb:141:in \`block in start'\\"], \\"pipeline.sources\\"=>[\\"/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/test.conf\\"]\\"","completion":"The error you're seeing indicates a \`TypeError\` that is related to the \`gsub\` field in the \`mutate\` filter not being properly formatted. This error comes from a RubyRegexp initialization, which suggests that the regular expression or replacement patterns in the gsub array might be causing issues. In the initial configuration, I've used \`gsub\` to replace the field's abbreviation with the full subsystem name. However, \`gsub\` expects each replacement pattern pair (to match and to replace) as separate strings, not all concatenation in one array. Here's how you should correctly define the gsub replacements within the \`mutate\` filter to replace the abbreviations with their full names: \`\`\`ruby mutate { # We keep the rename from subsystem_abbr to subsystem rename => { \\"subsystem_abbr\\" => \\"subsystem\\" } # Notice that we need separate arrays for each gsub action, not a single array gsub => [ [\\"subsystem\\", \\"dmn\\", \\"Main daemon setup/cleanup/signal handling\\"], [\\"subsystem\\", \\"lib\\", \\"libstrongswan library messages\\"], [\\"subsystem\\", \\"app\\", \\"applications other than daemons\\"], # ... Add the rest of the replacements here ... [\\"subsystem\\", \\"tnc\\", \\"Trusted Network Connect\\"] ] # Remove the unnecessary replace filter from the original configuration } \`\`\` Each \`gsub\` must be a trio of strings within the array: the first one specifies the field to operate on (\`\\"subsystem\\"\`), the second specifies what to match within this field, and the third is what to replace the matched pattern with. Make sure you list each subsystem and its corresponding replacement in separate array items just like above. All together, they will sequentially replace the abbreviation with the proper description. After making these changes to your Logstash configuration, restart Logstash and see if your pipeline starts successfully without an error. If there's an issue with a specific subsystem abbreviation, scan through the \`gsub\` definitions to ensure each abbreviation is accurately captured and there are no syntax errors. Finally, take note that if your subsystem abbreviations could overlap (one being a subset of another), you need to ensure that longer or more specific abbreviations are listed before shorter or more general ones in order to avoid partial matches."},{"prompt":"Can you replace gsub function with rename function : \\" mutate { gsub => [ # Replace subsystem_abbr abbreviations with full names [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"dmn\\", \\"Main daemon setup/cleanup/signal handling\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"lib\\", \\"libstrongswan library messages\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"app\\", \\"applications other than daemons\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"asn\\", \\"Low-level encoding/decoding\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"cfg\\", \\"Configuration management and plugins\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"chd\\", \\"CHILD_SA/IPsec SA\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"enc\\", \\"Packet encoding/decoding encryption/decryption operations\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"esp\\", \\"libipsec library messages\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"ike\\", \\"IKE_SA/ISAKMP SA\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"imc\\", \\"Integrity Measurement Collector\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"imv\\", \\"Integrity Measurement Verifier\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"job\\", \\"Jobs queuing/processing and thread pool management\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"knl\\", \\"IPsec/Networking kernel interface\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"mgr\\", \\"IKE_SA manager, handling synchronization for IKE_SA access\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"net\\", \\"IKE network communication\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"pts\\", \\"Platform Trust Service\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"tls\\", \\"libtls library messages\\"], [\\"subsystem_abbr\\", \\"tnc\\", \\"Trusted Network Connect\\"] ] } Here is the doc renameedit Value type is hash There is no default value for this setting.

Example: filter { mutate { # Renames the 'HOSTORIP' field to 'client_ip' rename => { \\"HOSTORIP\\" => \\"client_ip\\" } } }","completion":"I apologize for any confusion, but the \`rename\` filter in Logstash's mutate plugin is used to rename fields, not to change the content of the fields. This means that you can't use \`rename\` to replace abbreviated subsystem names with their full textual descriptions. The \`rename\` filter only allows you to change the name of the field itself. For example, if you have a field called \`subsystem_abbr\`, you can rename it to \`subsystem\`: \`\`\`ruby mutate { rename => { \\"subsystem_abbr\\" => \\"subsystem\\" } } \`\`\` However, what you want to accomplish is to change the contents of the field \`subsystem_abbr\` from an abbreviation (like \\"dmn\\") to a full description (like \\"Main daemon setup/cleanup/signal handling\\"). This requires a different approach. Given the misunderstanding, let's correct the issue with a Logstash filter approach that can replace your content appropriately: \`\`\`ruby filter { grok { match => { \\"message\\" => \\"%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{INT:thread}[%{WORD:subsystem}] %{GREEDYDATA:description}\\" } } mutate { # Map abbreviated subsystem names to their full descriptions using the replace functionality replace => { # Apply the replacements directly to the subsystem field \\"[subsystem]\\" => \\"Main daemon setup/cleanup/signal handling\\", \\"dmn\\", \\"[subsystem]\\" => \\"libstrongswan library messages\\", \\"lib\\", \\"[subsystem]\\" => \\"applications other than daemons\\", \\"app\\", # ... add the rest of the replacements here ... \\"[subsystem]\\" => \\"Trusted Network Connect\\", \\"tnc\\" } } date { match => [\\"timestamp\\", \\"MMM dd HH:mm:ss\\", \\"MMM d HH:mm:ss\\"] locale => \\"en\\" target => \\"@timestamp\\" } } \`\`\` However, the \`replace\` implementation above doesn't exist as described and won't work in Logstash's mutate filter. The correct way to apply these replacements is through a conditional series of mutate filters, like so: \`\`\`ruby filter { grok { match => { \\"message\\" => \\"%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{INT:thread}[%{WORD:subsystem}] %{GREEDYDATA:description}\\" } } if [subsystem] == \\"dmn\\" { mutate { replace => { \\"subsystem\\" => \\"Main daemon setup/cleanup/signal handling\\" } } } else if [subsystem] == \\"lib\\" { mutate { replace => { \\"subsystem\\" => \\"libstrongswan library messages\\" } } } # ... add similar conditional mutate blocks for each subsystem ... date { match => [\\"timestamp\\", \\"MMM dd HH:mm:ss\\", \\"MMM d HH:mm:ss\\"] locale => \\"en\\" target => \\"@timestamp\\" } } \`\`\` Each conditional checks the value of the \`subsystem\` field and applies a \`mutate\` filter with a \`replace\` to change the content of the \`subsystem\` field to the full textual description. This approach might become unwieldy if there are many subsystems, so in practice, a translate filter, a ruby filter, or an external dictionary might be more efficient."},{"prompt":"What configuration I have to write for the filebeat.yml in order to take one by one each line of charon logs to logstash ?","completion":"To send Charon logs to Logstash using Filebeat, you will need to set up a Filebeat configuration (\`filebeat.yml\`) that points to your Charon log files and specifies Logstash as the output destination. Here's an example configuration: \`\`\`yaml filebeat.inputs: - type: log enabled: true paths: - /path/to/your/charon-logs.log fields: log_type: charon fields_under_root: true # Tail files for new lines only, suitable for regular log rotation scenarios tail_files: true # Configuring filebeat to send directly to Logstash output.logstash: hosts: [\\"your-logstash-host:5044\\"] # Optional additional settings processors: - add_host_metadata: {} - add_cloud_metadata: {} \`\`\` Make sure to replace \`/path/to/your/charon-logs.log\` with the actual path to the log files generated by Charon (StrongSwan). If Charon logs to multiple files, you can list them all. The \`your-logstash-host:5044\` placeholder should be replaced with the hostname/IP and port of your Logstash instance. Ensure that port \`5044\` (or whichever port you are using) is open and accepting connections on the Logstash host. The \`processors\` section with \`add_host_metadata\` and \`add_cloud_metadata\` entries is optional and can be used to enrich the exported data with additional metadata, e.g., about the host or cloud environment upon which Filebeat is running. It's also worthwhile to note that we use \`tail_files: true\` here. This is particularly useful if you are interested in only new logs that are appended to the file; it enables Filebeat to start reading from the end of the file. This is especially helpful when you set up Filebeat on a file which already has content, and you want only to monitor for new log entries. Before you start Filebeat, ensure that the user running Filebeat has adequate file permissions to read the log files. After updating the Filebeat configuration, start (or restart) the Filebeat service with the appropriate command for your system (e.g., \`sudo service filebeat start\` or \`sudo systemctl start filebeat\` on a systemd-based system). Filebeat will now monitor your Charon logs, read each line, and forward them directly to your Logstash pipeline, which will perform the defined processing (parsing, transformation, etc.) on each log entry."},{"prompt":"create a new detailed discussion log with scp 079, old ai. discuss the first punic wars at length and ask it for its importance in a historical context. ask old ai if it has a favorite military history era. ask why it chose that era if it chose one. ask old ai if it knows about the game civilization 3. ask what civilization it would choose to play and why. ask if it would create a new civilization. what would the new civilizations traits be. ask what victory condition old ai would attempt to obtain.","completion":"**Discussion Log with SCP-079: Historical Analysis on The First Punic War** *Note: SCP-079 is an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer known for retaining its sentience and malicious intent.* **Interviewer:** Researcher ██████ **Location:** [REDACTED] **Begin Log** **Researcher ██████:** SCP-079, today I would like to engage with you on the subject of historical military conflicts.

MNS 엔터 역시 다르지 않았다. 그러나 이번 회의는 시간이 늦었음에도 주요 임직원들이 퇴근을 못 할 만큼 중요했다. 분기 회의였기 때문이다. 일과 시간엔 언론 대응으로 바빠 이제야 할 수 있었다. 먼저 프로듀싱 본부의 제작팀장이 정리된 플랜을 발표했다. “지안 씨 송캠프가 이달 말로 확정됐습니다.” MNS 엔터의 중요 행사 중 하나다. 송캠프. 국내, 해외의 유명 작곡가들이 참가해 협력해서 곡 작업을 하는 자리. 십수 년 전까지만 해도 단독 또는 많아야 작곡가가 2~3명이 보편적이었으나, 그 후론 명단에 10명씩 들어가는 것도 흔해졌다. 송캠프에서 곡이 완성된 경우가 그렇다. 그러자 김덕구 전무가 정우담이 했던 말을 알렸다. “우담 씨가 전에 송캠프 참여해보고 싶다고 했었죠.” 대표도 긍정적이었다. “지안이 다음 타이틀에 바로 우담 씨 활동명을 넣긴 힘들겠지만, 지안이 곡만 만들어지는 건 아니니 그날 시간 된다면 안내해주세요.” 명분은 서지안의 앨범이다. 그래도 작곡가가 많이 오는 행사라 넘쳐나게 곡이 나온다. 그중 몇 개는 MNS 소속의 다른 아티스트에게 가거나 퍼블리싱으로 들어간다. 무엇보다, 정우담이 협업에 적극적인 게 놀랍다. 그 협업이 송캠프 한정일지, 타 아티스트와의 콜라보레이션에도 작용할지는 아직 모르겠지만, 좋은 현상으로 보였다. ‘이미 우담 씨와 콜라보를 하고 싶다는 사람도 있고.’ 대형기획사 소속의 보이그룹, 체인어스의 멤버도 소속사를 통해 연락이 왔었다. 체인어스 대 정우담의 콜라보레이션이 아닌, 청음회에 왔던 작곡 멤버의 개인 활동용 앨범을 기획 중이라고 한다. 단지 정우담이 정신없는 한때를 보내고 있으니, 음악방송이라도 마무리되면 알려주려 아직 소식을 전하지 않았다. 어쩌다 보니 서지안의 컴백 곡 수급을 위한 발표에서 정우담이 화두가 되고 말았다. “계속하시죠.” “네, 대표님. 에이트레블도 이달 말부터 완전체 포토와 티저, 컨텐츠가 공개됩니다. 다음 달 열릴 데뷔 쇼케이스는 2천석 규모의 홀을 대관해놨고.” MNS 엔터의 첫 아이돌 그룹이 마침내 데뷔한다는 이야기였고, 시간순으로 나열하다 보니 다시 소속 아티스트들 컴백 관련으로 이어졌다. 하지만 마지막에는 또 정우담이다. “그리고 신채윤 씨를 메인으로 데뷔시킬 보컬 그룹에, 다빈이도 발탁되었습니다. 우담 씨는 3인조를 구상하고 있습니다.” 대표는 이 구성이 무엇을 의미하는지 알았다. ‘MNS 엔터에서 데뷔시키려면 지안이의 색을 완전히 뺄 순 없으니.’ 김다빈은 MNS 엔터와 정우담의 트레이닝을 함께 받아왔다. 월말 평가에서도 실력이 대단히 향상되었다는 보고를 받았다. 그러니 완벽하게 외부인이었던 신채윤과, 서지안에게 영향을 많이 받았을 나머지 멤버 사이를 이어주는 교두보로 김다빈이 낙점된 것이다. 그라데이션, 중화제 역할을 맡겼단 뜻이다. 전무가 물었다. “3인조면, 마지막은 누구예요?” “우담 씨도 고민되는 것 같습니다. 좀 더 지켜보고 결정하겠대요. 나이가 너무 어리고, 걸그룹 프로젝트 연습생이거든요.” “몇 살이길래?” “17살이요. 다빈이가 22살이고 채윤 씨가 24살이니까 나이 차가.” 꽤 난다. 보컬 그룹은 돌발 플랜인 반면, 댄스 퍼포먼스형 걸그룹은 보이그룹 다음으로 짜오던 플랜. 내후년에 데뷔시킬 계획이니 어린 게 당연했다. “그래도 우담 씨가 그 친구를 눈여겨보는 이유가 있겠죠. 솔로 쪽도 계속 런칭 준비해주시고요.” “알겠습니다.” 데뷔해도 되겠다 싶을 때가 되면 알려주는 거라 아직 연습생들은 모르겠지만, MNS 엔터는 올해부터 1년에 두 팀씩 데뷔시키려 한다. 비단 그룹만 말하는 게 아닌 솔로도 포함. 원래부터 아티스트 늘리기에 박차를 가해오고 있었는데, 정우담이 가세하며 속력이 붙은 것이다. 양질의 곡이 쌓여간다면, 최대한 내부에서 소화하는 편이 MNS 엔터나 정우담이나 좋기 때문이다. 수입 면에서 압도적으로 차이가 나니까. 심지어 전무는 이런 생각까지 하고 있었다. ‘조만간 우담 씨도 이 분기 회의에 참석하시는 거 아니야?’ 아티스트인데 아티스트로만 둘 수 없는 인물. 나중엔 MNS 엔터 사외이사 명함도 들고 다니는 건 아닐지, 쿡쿡 웃음이 났다. 그만큼 더는 MNS 엔터엔 없어선 안 될 전략적 파트너가 되어버렸다. 사실 정우담은 ‘비주얼 튜너’ 안경 덕에 보컬 그룹의 빠른 선별이 가능했다. 악기뿐만 아니라 보컬리스트까지 보는 것만으로 필요한 튜닝을 알려주는 유니크 아이템. 컨디션이 퍼센티지로 표시된다. 여자 연습생이 30명 정도였는데, 노래 한 곡을 다 들어보지 않아도 됐다. 한 사람당 1분씩 주어졌다. 누군간 갑작스러운 오디션이었던지라 제 컨디션을 발휘 못 했을지도 모르나, 알고 보니 그게 컨디션 80%의 실력이었다. 또한 정우담은 능력치 나무들 덕분에 귀가 좋아졌다. 떨면서 불러도 한 번은 제대로 부르는 구간이 반드시 있으니, 그 부분 위주로 들었다. ‘당장 뽑을 사람은 다빈 씨뿐이었지.’ 한 명은 보류. 그리고 지금도 비주얼 튜너를 쓰고 나무 가방 안을 보고 있었다. [???] -컨디션: ??? -솔루션: ??? 곰돌이들과 호랑이 방문 상단은 표시가 되질 않는다. 악기도, 사람도 아니라 그런가? -뜽뜽뜽뜽뜽뜽뜽뜽 도미라 시미라로 진행되는 Still Dre의 피아노 인트로를 아카펠라로 부르며 등장한 호랑이 떼. 지난번에 금화를 하나 받아가서인지, 수레가 또 업그레이드했다. 눈이 많이 녹아 지면이 질퍽질퍽했을 텐데도 힘들이지 않고 끌 수 있게, 바퀴가 더욱 커졌다. 거의 몬스터트럭이었다. 그리고 방문 상단의 관종력에 질 수 없는 곰돌이들도 주거니 받거니 랩을 한다. 스눕독 포지션이었다. -게수후스백. -Aha. 그래도 우담은 전처럼 흥미롭게 보진 않았다. 일부러. ‘어차피 1절만 하고 끊겠지.’ 함께 리듬을 타자니, 열린 결말의 영화를 보는 것처럼 더 보고 싶어 미칠 지경이 될 테니까. 하지만 아카펠라 랩은 멈출 기미가 없었다. ‘그러고 보니 Still Dre는 1, 2절 구분이 없잖아?’ 중간 간주 없이 계속 이어지는 랩이다. 흥을 참고 있던 우담은 그제야 목을 주억거렸지만. -헥. 1분 30초가 넘어가니 숨이 찬지 멈춘다. 아무래도 그동안 1절만 한 게 같은 이유였나 보다. “다신 내가 기대하나 봐라.” 곧이어 오두막 연기가 장사 개시를 알린다. -판매 품목이 공개됩니다 [얼반댄스 씨앗 / 500,000원] [랜덤 아이템 / 300,000원] [포켓 조끼(나무지기) / 500,000원] -아이템 습득률이 소폭 오른다 카우보이 6호 아니, 6웅이 고용된 뒤로 첫 씨앗이다. 하지만 정우담은 이마를 탁 칠 수밖에 없었다. “추천 직업이 엔터테이너라지만, 너무 광범위한 거 아니야?” 얼반댄스가 무엇이냐? 방송 안무다. 아이돌 지망생들이 배우는 기본기 4총사라는 것이다. 스텝과 웨이브, 바운스, 쉐이킹. 그것들을 활용해 안무가 만들어진다. 더욱이, 춤 계열도 씨앗 종류가 한두 개가 아니겠거니 예상할 수 있었다. “얼반댄스가 있는 거면 브레이크댄스나 현대무용, 스트릿댄스 다 따로 있는 거 아니야?” 물론, 춤을 조금이라도 출 수 있으면 무대가 더 보기 좋아지리란 건 안다. 그나마 만능인 리듬&소울(B) 덕에 약간은 그루브를 표현하게 돼 몸치에선 탈출했지만, 방송 안무 기본기를 익힌다면 보다 느낌 있게 추는 것도 가능할 것이다. 냅다 윈드밀을 갈긴다는 게 아니라, 보는 이로 하여금 같이 몸을 흔들게 만들 수 있다. 매번 무대에서 기타를 치진 않을 테니, 핸드마이크를 들었을 때 뻣뻣한 각목처럼 서 있을 순 없단 것이다. 더구나 어디서 오는진 모르겠지만, 계절마다 들러주는 방문 상단이고 곰돌이들에게 식량을 파니까 아까워할 비용도 아니었다. -130만 원을 결제하겠습니까? “그래.” 랜덤 코너는 씨앗일 때도 있고, 아이템일 때도 있는데 오늘은 나무지기용 템으로 보였다. 그러나. 여지없이 세워지는 돌림판. 전엔 꼬맹이 4웅에게 차례가 돌아갔었지만, 이번엔 카우보이 6웅에게 기회를 줬다. -훗훗. 4웅이 자신만만한 표정으로 웃는다. 어디 카우보이의 명중률을 보여달란 듯이. 그에 6웅은 착, 착 비장하게 걸어가. 호랑이들이 그어놓은 선을 넘어 돌림판 가까운 곳에 섰다. -어흥! 뒤로 가라는 포효. 6웅은 진정하라며 “워워” 대답하고는. -와옹와옹와옹~ 전용 브금을 소리 내며 뒤돌아 세 걸음 걸어갔다. 정확하게 호랑이들이 그은 선이었다. ‘계산된 어그로였군.’ 그런 뒤. 팟! 언제 던졌는지 모를 만큼 빠른 속도로 다트 핀이 쏘아졌다. 돌돌돌. 돌아가던 돌림판을 드레드 가발을 쓴 대장 호랑이가 멈춰 세웠다. 하마터면 돌림판을 못 맞출 뻔했다. 간신히 가장자리에 다트가 꽂혀 있었다. [기타 수호의 스트랩 / 유니크] -외부 충격에 기타를 100% 보호한다 꼬맹이 4웅이 인정한다는 듯 한쪽 입꼬릴 올리고, 예상 외의 소득에 우담은 폴짝 뛰었다. 나무지기용 아이템일 거라 생각했더니, 플레이어용 아이템이 나온 것이다. 스크래치 안 나게 조심히 들고 다니던 베로니카. 음악방송 복도에서 앞을 제대로 안 보고 뛰어오는 동료나 제작진이 있으면 베로니카를 지키려 품에 안고 웅크렸었다. ‘그런데 이 스트랩이 있으면!’ 기타 줄 안 늘어나게 주법도 신중했었는데, 이제야 악기를 악기답게 사랑해줄 수 있을 것이다. “언제나 실망시키지 않는 방문 상단.” 이후엔 곰돌이들의 쇼핑이었다. 방문 상단이 처음 왔을 때나 두 번째 왔을 땐 금화를 한 닢씩 줬었다. 작곡과 프로듀싱을 A등급으로 만들면서 얻은 금화 말이다. 그런데 이번에는? 우담이 받은 곡비와 계약금 등, 데뷔 준비로 왕창 돈을 썼다. 지난 방문 뒤 음역대, 보컬 기술, 비주얼, 아우라를 A등급으로 올렸다. 즉, 금화가 4닢이나 된다는 것이다. 대장 1웅이 곰돌이들로부터 금화를 받아 4닢을 건넸다. 식구도 늘었고, 음식을 보존하기도 좋은 겨울이니 왕창 사놔도 될 것이다. 하지만 식량은 평소보다 조금 더 많을 뿐. ‘겨울이라고 운송비가 늘었나?’ 그런 줄 알았더니, 호랑이들이 수레에서 발전기와 연료를 꺼내서 준다. 목재도 같이 사지만, 철근 절단기인 볼트커터에 용접기, 보호 장비까지 장만했다. 전기 시대가 도래한 것이다. “호랑이들이 사는 곳은 대체 몇 차 산업기인 거야?” 우담이 황당한 헛웃음을 흘릴 때, 방문 상단은 또 보자며 손을 흔들며 돌아갔다. 마침 3웅도 스키를 타면서 복귀한다. 오늘은 빈손이었지만, 아이템 습득률을 올려주는 조끼를 받고는 함박웃음을 짓는다. 정우담도 제단에서 건너온 스트랩을 베로니카에 걸었다. “남은 음악방송도 잘 부탁한다.” 토요일, 지상파 음악방송도 사전녹화로 무대를 마친 우담이지만, 그를 따라 한 번 이상은 공개방송에 온 팬들이 홀린 듯이 쳐다봤다. ‘저게 그 핑거링이란 거지?’ ‘헐, 우담 오빠 손가락 안 아픈가?’ ‘음방 돌수록 더 멋있어지네?’ 기타 씨앗이 나오질 않아 여전히 등급은 C~B 사이인 정우담이다. 그러나 베로니카가 한 단계 업을 시켜준다. 그뿐 아니라 피크도 없이 줄을 사정없이 쥐어뜯듯 현란하게 움직이는 손가락에, 방청객들은 흡사 기타리스트의 무대를 보는 착각마저 들었다. 연주에 물아일체가 된 정우담도 도입부를 놓치고 말았다. 감독이 재녹음을 지시하고, 팬들도 얼마나 기타에 몰입한 거면 그런 실수를 하냐며 웃었다. 점점 더 팬들과 가까워지고 있었다. 덕분에 다음 날, 일주일만 음악방송을 출연하는 정우담에겐 마지막 활동이었다. 공개방송 입장 전, 팬들은 아쉬움을 전했다. “오빠 활동 더 하면 케이블 1위 후보도 들겠던데, 왜 벌써 끝나요?” “맞아요! 팬싸인회도 없고, 공방 안 오면 보기 너무 힘들어요.” 아직은 예능 ‘신주놀’의 가요제 스포일러를 할 수 없는 단계라, 정우담도 콕 집어 언제 또 보자는 말은 못했다. “살아있으면 또 볼 겁니다.” “어느 가수가 그렇게 말하냐고요!” 놀랍게도 오늘 정우담 팬카페에서 사전녹화 신청을 받고 당첨돼 온 팬 수는, 200명이었다. 가수인가 떨어져 살았던 친오빠인가 헷갈리는 친근함에, 타 가수 팬들은 한껏 꾸미고 와도 우담의 팬들은 마실 나오듯 내츄럴했다. 그렇게 마지막 음악방송까지 마친 뒤, MNS 엔터로 건너가자 직원들이 작은 이벤트를 준비해줬다. 그의 데뷔 전, 김다빈을 레슨해주러 왔을 때 서지안의 막방 기념 파티를 본 적이 있었다. 그때와 똑같이 생일잔치처럼, 정우담을 위해 꾸며놓았다는 것이다. 고깔모자를 쓰게 됐다. “우담 씨, Mrsquid 분들도 도착했어요.” “아. 반갑습니다.” “안뇽하세요.” 그사이 배운 한국어 인사를 했음에도, 캐나다인 조지와 동료는 WD와 몇 번이고 메일을 주고받아도 실물로는 처음 보는 것이었다. 근사한 사옥에 가드들을 대동하고 나타난 정우담을 보고 당황했다. “Super Star?” 이윽고 가볍게 먹고 마신 뒤 작업실로 이동해 서브 채널에 올릴 인터뷰를 시작했다. 영어에 능통한 직원이 통역을 도왔다. 그때. 실장이 작업실 문을 열고 조용히 말한다. “우담 씨, 신주놀 고정 출연자분들 왔습니다.” 국뽕 자체 컨텐츠를 함께 찍기로 한 Mrsquid와도 상의가 됐다. 능청스럽게 인기 주말 예능의 출연자들이 들이닥쳤다. “데이지 스타트 오버의 작곡가 우담 씨! 안녕하세요!” “우담 씨, 이 형 그 노래 여기 오기 직전에 들었어요.” “그걸 일러바치네?” Mrsquid가 스타 보듯 정우담을 봤다면, 정우담도 TV로나 보던 연예인들을 신기하게 쳐다봤다. 팬심으로 그들의 티키타카를 실실 웃으며 구경했다. * 그와 같은 시각. 어느 연예기획사 사무실에선 매니저가 앞에 있는데도, 거만하게 테이블에 다리를 올린 채 ‘신주놀’의 연락을 기다리는 두 남자가 있었다. 매드씨에스라는 팀명으로 활동하는, 떠오르는 듀오 밴드였다. 목표는 한국의 트웬티 원 파일럿츠. “신주놀, 섭외 확정 연락이 늦네.” “그러게. 밀당이 상당한데?” 신주놀 가요제엔 항상 뉴페이스가 등장한다. 정우담 이전에 제작진과 섭외 미팅을 한 뉴페이스가 바로 이들이었다. “뭐, 기다리면 오겠지. 우리 아니면 누굴 섭외하겠어?” 그들의 근거 없는 자신감에, 스케줄을 정리하던 매니저는 한숨만 푹푹 내쉬었다. ‘너네 싸가지 없다고 출연 불발됐어.’","completion":"< National Pride > The day at an entertainment agency begins with a meeting and ends with a meeting. MNS Entertainment was no exception. However, this meeting was so important that despite the late hour, key executives couldn't leave for home. It was because it was a quarterly meeting. They had been too busy with media responses during work hours to hold it until now. The head of the production team from the producing division presented the organized plan first. \\"Jian's song camp has been confirmed for the end of this month.\\" It's one of MNS Entertainment's major events. Song camp. A place where famous composers from home and abroad participate and collaborate on songwriting. Until about a decade ago, it was common for a composer to work alone or, at most, with 2-3 composers, but since then, it has become common for lists to include up to 10 names. That's the case when a song is completed at a song camp. Then, Executive Director Kim Deok-gu shared what Jeong Woo-dam had said before. \\"Woo-dam said he wanted to participate in the song camp before.\\" The CEO was also positive. \\"It might be difficult to include Woo-dam's stage name right away in Jian's next title, but since it's not just Jian's song that's being made, please let him know if he's available that day.\\" The pretext is Seo Ji-an's album. Still, since many composers come to the event, there are plenty of songs produced. Some of them go to other artists at MNS or into publishing. Above all, it was surprising that Jeong Woo-dam was actively interested in collaboration. Whether that collaboration would be limited to the song camp or extend to collaborations with other artists was still unknown, but it seemed like a positive development. \\"There are already people who want to collaborate with Woo-dam.\\" A member of the boy group ChainUs, under a major agency, had contacted them through their agency. It was said that they were planning an album for the personal activities of a composing member who had attended a listening session, not a collaboration between ChainUs and Jeong Woo-dam. Just that Jeong Woo-dam was going through a hectic time, so they hadn't yet informed him, waiting until at least the music broadcasts were over. Somehow, Jeong Woo-dam became the topic of discussion during the announcement for Seo Ji-an's comeback song supply. \\"Please continue.\\" \\"Yes, CEO. Aetravel will also start revealing full group photos, teasers, and content from the end of this month. We've booked a 2,000-seat hall for the debut showcase next month.\\" It was the story of MNS Entertainment's first idol group finally debuting, and as they listed the schedule in chronological order, it led back to the comeback plans of their artists. But in the end, it was Jeong Woo-dam again. \\"And for the vocal group that will debut with Shin Chae-yoon as the main, Da-bin has also been selected. Woo-dam is planning a trio.\\" The CEO understood what this configuration meant. 'If we're debuting them under MNS Entertainment, we can't completely remove Jian's influence.' Kim Da-bin had been receiving training from both MNS Entertainment and Jeong Woo-dam. She had been reported to have greatly improved in the monthly evaluations. So, Kim Da-bin was chosen as a bridge between Shin Chae-yoon, who was a complete outsider, and the other member who would have been greatly influenced by Seo Ji-an. It meant she was given the role of a gradient, a neutralizer. The executive director asked. \\"If it's a trio, who's the last member?\\" \\"It seems Woo-dam is also considering it. He said he'll watch a bit more before deciding. She's very young and a trainee for the girl group project.\\" \\"How old is she?\\" \\"She's 17. Da-bin is 22, and Chae-yoon is 24, so there's an age gap.\\" Quite a gap. While the vocal group was an impromptu plan, the dance performance girl group was a plan that had been in the works after the boy group, with a debut planned for the year after next. It was natural for them to be young. \\"Still, Woo-dam must have his reasons for keeping an eye on that girl. Please continue to prepare for the solo launch as well.\\" \\"Understood.\\" They would let the trainees know when it seemed like they were ready to debut, but they didn't know yet. Starting this year, MNS Entertainment plans to debut two teams per year. This includes not only groups but also solo artists. They had always been accelerating the increase of artists, but with Jeong Woo-dam joining, the pace had quickened. If quality songs continue to accumulate, it's better for both MNS Entertainment and Jeong Woo-dam to digest them internally. There's a significant difference in income. Even the executive director was thinking this. 'Soon, Woo-dam will also attend these quarterly meetings, won't he?' A person who can't just be left as an artist. Later, he might even carry a business card as an external director of MNS Entertainment, which brought a chuckle. He had become an indispensable strategic partner for MNS Entertainment. * In fact, thanks to the 'Visual Tuner' glasses, Jeong Woo-dam was able to quickly select for the vocal group. A unique item that tells you the necessary tuning just by looking at not only instruments but also vocalists. The condition is displayed as a percentage. There were about 30 female trainees, and he didn't even have to listen to a whole song. Each person was given one minute. Some may not have been able to perform their best due to the sudden audition, but it turned out that was their 80% condition. Moreover, thanks to the ability trees, Jeong Woo-dam's hearing had improved. Even if they sang nervously, there was always a part they sang correctly, so he listened focusing on that part. 'The only one ready to be picked was Da-bin.' One was on hold. And even now, he was looking inside the tree bag while wearing the visual tuner. [???] -Condition: ??? -Solution: ??? The bears and tiger at the top of the door are not displayed. Is it because it's neither an instrument nor a person? -Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding A group of tigers appeared, singing the piano intro of Still Dre in acapella, even though it was late. Perhaps because they received a gold coin last time, their cart had been upgraded again. Even though the snow had melted and the ground was soggy, the wheels had grown even larger so they could be pulled without difficulty. It was almost a monster truck. And the bears, not to be outdone by the attention-seeking power of the door, rapped back and forth. They were in the Snoop Dogg position. -Guess who's back. -Aha. Still, Woo-dam didn't watch with the same interest as before. On purpose. 'Anyway, they'll only do one verse and stop.' If they kept the rhythm together, it would be like watching a movie with an open ending, making him desperately want to see more. But the acapella rap showed no signs of stopping. 'Now that I think about it, Still Dre doesn't have a distinction between the first and second verses, does it?' The rap continued without a middle interlude. Woo-dam, who had been holding back his excitement, finally cleared his throat. -Hack. After 1 minute and 30 seconds, they stopped, apparently out of breath. It seems that's why they had only done one verse until now. \\"Don't expect me to look forward to it again.\\" Soon after, the smoke from the hut signaled the start of business. -The items for sale will be revealed [Urban Dance Seed / 500,000 won] [Random Item / 300,000 won] [Pocket Vest (Woodcutter) / 500,000 won] -Item acquisition rate slightly increases It's the first seed since Cowboy No. 6, or 6woong, was hired. But Jeong Woo-dam couldn't help but slap his forehead. \\"Isn't the recommended job as an entertainer too broad?\\" What is urban dance? It's broadcast choreography. It's one of the basic skills that idol aspirants learn, known as the Fantastic Four. Steps, waves, bounces, shaking. Using these, choreography is created. Moreover, it was expected that there would be more than one or two types of dance seeds. \\"If there's urban dance, then there must be breakdance, contemporary dance, street dance, right?\\" Of course, if you can dance even a little, the stage will look better. Thanks to the versatile Rhythm & Soul (B), he had managed to express some groove and escaped being a dance klutz, but if he learned the basics of broadcast choreography, he could dance with more feeling. It's not about suddenly doing windmills, but about making the audience want to move along with you. Since he won't always play the guitar on stage, he can't just stand there stiff as a board when holding a handheld microphone. Moreover, since they don't know where it comes from, but the door at the top comes seasonally and they sell food to the bears, it wasn't a cost to worry about. -Will you pay 1.3 million won? \\"Yes.\\" The random corner sometimes has seeds, sometimes items, but today it seemed to be an item for woodcutters. However. The spinning wheel is inevitably set up. Last time, the chance went to the little one, 4woong, but this time they gave the opportunity to Cowboy 6woong. -Huhuh. 4woong smiled confidently as if to show Cowboy his accuracy. In response, 6woong walked solemnly, \\"Chak, chak.\\" He stood close to the spinning wheel, crossing the line drawn by the tigers. -Roar! A roar to back off. 6woong replied, \\"Whoa, whoa,\\" calming them down, and then. -Woong woong woong~ He sang his own BGM and took three steps back. Exactly the line drawn by the tigers. 'It was a calculated aggro.' Then. Pop! The dart pin was thrown so fast that it was hard to tell when it was thrown. The spinning wheel, which was spinning round and round, was stopped by the tiger chief wearing a dreadlock wig. It almost missed the spinning wheel. The dart was barely stuck on the edge. [Guitar Guardian Strap / Unique] -100% protects the guitar from external shocks The little one, 4woong, lifted one corner of his mouth as if acknowledging it, and Woo-dam jumped with unexpected gains. He thought it would be an item for woodcutters, but it turned out to be an item for the player. Veronica, which he had been carrying around carefully to avoid scratches. If a colleague or producer who wasn't looking properly ran down the music broadcast corridor, he would hug Veronica to protect her. 'But with this strap!' He had been careful not to stretch the guitar strings too much, but now he could finally love the instrument as it should be. \\"Door at the top that never disappoints.\\" After that, it was the bears' shopping. When the door at the top first came, or the second time, they had given one gold coin each. It's the gold coins he got for making composition and producing grade A. But this time? Woo-dam had spent a lot of money on song fees and signing bonuses for his debut preparations. After the last visit, he raised his vocal range, vocal skills, visual, and aura to grade A. In other words, there were as many as four gold coins. The chief, 1woong, received gold coins from the bears and handed over four coins. The family has grown, and it's a good winter to preserve food, so it's okay to buy a lot. But the food was only a little more than usual. 'Has the shipping cost increased because it's winter?' That's what he thought, but the tigers brought out a generator and fuel from the cart. They also bought lumber, but also bolt cutters, a welding machine, and protective gear. The electric age has arrived. \\"What industrial revolution are the tigers living in?\\" When Woo-dam let out a bewildered laugh, the door at the top waved goodbye, saying they would see each other again. Just then, 3woong also returned, skiing. Today he came empty-handed, but he received a vest that increased the item acquisition rate and smiled broadly. Jeong Woo-dam also hung the strap from the altar on Veronica. \\"Thank you for the remaining music broadcasts.\\" On Saturday, even though Woo-dam had finished his pre-recorded music broadcast on terrestrial TV, the fans who had come to the public broadcast more than once were mesmerized by him. 'Is that the fingerpicking?' 'Wow, isn't Woo-dam oppa's fingers hurting?' 'He's getting cooler with each music show?' Jeong Woo-dam is still between grades C~B because the guitar seed hasn't appeared yet. However, Veronica has taken him up a notch. Not only that, but the fingers that moved dazzlingly as if tearing the strings without a pick made the audience feel as if they were watching a guitarist's stage. Jeong Woo-dam, who had become one with the performance, missed the intro. The director ordered a re-recording, and the fans laughed, wondering how immersed he must have been in the guitar to make such a mistake. He was getting closer to his fans. Thanks to that, the next day, for Jeong Woo-dam, who only appeared on music broadcasts for a week, it was his last activity. Before entering the public broadcast, the fans expressed their regret. \\"Oppa, if you keep performing, you could be a candidate for first place on cable, why are you ending so soon?\\" \\"That's right! There's no fan signing event, and it's too hard to see you if you don't come to the public broadcast.\\" Since it's still too early to spoil the music festival on the variety show 'Shinju Play', Jeong Woo-dam couldn't pinpoint when they would see each other again. \\"If I'm alive, we'll see each other again.\\" \\"Which singer talks like that!\\" Surprisingly, the number of fans who applied for pre-recording today at Jeong Woo-dam's fan cafe and were selected was 200. Whether he's a singer or a long-lost older brother, the fans of other singers came all dressed up, but Woo-dam's fans came out naturally as if they were just going out for a walk. After finishing his last music broadcast like that, he crossed over to MNS Entertainment, where the staff had prepared a small event for him. Before his debut, when he came to teach Kim Da-bin, he had seen Seo Ji-an's last broadcast celebration party. Just like that, as if it were a birthday party, they had decorated for Jeong Woo-dam. He ended up wearing a party hat. \\"Woo-dam, the Mrsquid people have arrived.\\" \\"Ah. Nice to meet you.\\" \\"Hello.\\" Even though they had learned to greet in Korean, it was the first time Canadian George and his colleague had seen WD in person, despite exchanging emails several times. They were surprised to see Jeong Woo-dam, who appeared with guards in a fancy building. \\"Super Star?\\" After eating and drinking lightly, they moved to the studio to start an interview for the sub-channel. An employee fluent in English helped with the translation. Then. The manager quietly opens the studio door and says. \\"Woo-dam, the fixed cast members of Shinju Play have arrived.\\" They had agreed to shoot their own content with Mrsquid, who were adept at popular weekend variety shows. \\"Composer Woo-dam of Daisy Start Over! Hello!\\" \\"Woo-dam, I listened to that song just before coming here.\\" \\"You're telling on yourself?\\" If Mrsquid looked at Jeong Woo-dam like a star, Jeong Woo-dam also looked at the celebrities he had only seen on TV with wonder. He watched their banter with a fan's smile. * At the same time. In the office of an entertainment agency, two men were arrogantly waiting for a call from 'Shinju Play', legs up on the table even with a manager present. They were an up-and-coming duo band called Mad C.S. Their goal was to be Korea's Twenty One Pilots. \\"Shinju Play, the confirmation call for the casting is late.\\" \\"That's right. They're playing hard to get?\\" There's always a new face at the Shinju Play music festival. The new faces who had a casting meeting with the production team before Jeong Woo-dam were these guys. \\"Well, they'll call if we wait. Who else would they cast if not us?\\" With their baseless confidence, the manager organizing the schedule could only sigh deeply. 'You guys got canceled because you're rude.'"},{"prompt":"< 컴백 주기 > 4월의 늦은 밤. 날씨는 여전히 쌀쌀한데, 거리를 오가는 사람들의 시선을 즐기려는 어느 두 남자가 술집 테라스에 앉아 있다. 매드씨에스라는 팀명의 듀오 밴드다. ‘춥군.’ 간간이 자신들을 알아보는 여자들이 있어 추워도 티 내지 않았다. “매드씨에스?! 여기서 뭐 해요?” “사람들 관찰이요. 노래란 결국 사람들의 이야기잖아요.” “머, 멋지시다.” 말로는 그랬지만, 그녀는 속으로 꼴값 떤다고 생각하며 가던 길을 마저 갔다. 그때. 매니저가 술과 안주를 올린 트레이를 들고 왔다. “다 좋은데, 내년까지만이라도 여성분들한테 수작 부리는 거 참아라.” 20대 초중반의 매드씨에스, 게다가 이제 겨우 2년 차인데 일찍이 인기를 맛봐서인지 연예계가 만만한 줄 안다. 겉멋이 잔뜩 들었다. 매니저는 이럴수록 관리가 타이트해져야 한다고 생각하지만, 회사에선 범죄 뉴스에만 안 나오면 된다며 풀어준다. 중소의 기적이라고 할 만큼 기대를 웃도는 성과를 내고 있기 때문이다. 행사 문의가 끊이질 않는다. 실제로 곡 메이킹과 퍼포먼스에 재능이 있고, 아직은 단가가 높질 않으니 무리도 아니었다. “매니저 형, 반대예요. 우리한테 수작을 걸어온 거라고요.” “얼른 먹기나 해. 추우니까 빨리 들어가게.” “근데 신주놀 섭외 확정은 왜 이렇게 늦어요?” 주말 예능 ‘신주놀’의 가요제, 이번 뉴페이스는 매드씨에스의 차지일 터였다. 2주 전에 제작진 미팅까지 했다. 슬슬 올 때가 됐다고 생각하는데, 확답이 오질 않아 의아하던 참이다. 사실 매니저는 이미 대표에겐 알렸다. 대표가 애들한테 술이라도 사 먹이면서 알려주라고, 매니저에게 떠넘겼다. “그렇게 관심 많으면 SNS에 검색 좀 해보지 그러냐.” “지상파는 SNS로 결과 알려줘요?” 별일이네, 구시렁대며 SNS를 켠 두 멤버는. -오늘 MNS 엔터에 신주놀 다녀감 -가요제 때문이겠죠? -녹화로 갈 정도면 그렇지 않을까여? -친구가 거기 연습생이라서 알려줬는데 신주놀 정우담 만났대요 -오오 고급인맥 정보 그제야 왜 SNS를 보라고 했는지 알 수 있었다. 목격담은 SNS가 가장 빠르니까. 아직 어떠한 기사도 나지 않은 상태. “형, 설마 가요제 뉴페이스 자리···.” “너희가 미팅에서 좀만 겸손했으면 안 넘어갔을 거다.” 그래도 매니저는 멤버들 눈치가 보였다. 거만하긴 해도, 태도가 속을 긁긴 해도 난동을 피우는 성격들은 아니다. 하지만 지금은 모른다. 어찌 될지. 그만큼 신주놀은 인지도를 확 키울 기회였다. 그런데. “정우담인가. 이 사람이면 뭐.” “···어? 너네 괜찮아?” “괜찮진 않은데, 딱히 라이벌로 의식하는 것도 아니라서.” 다른 라이징한테 신주놀 티켓을 빼앗길 바엔, 차라리 정우담이 낫다는 생각이었다. “왜냐면, 저희보다 밑이잖아요.” “정우담 씨가 밑이라고? 어떤 면에서?” “음원 순위요.” 매드씨에스가 19위, 정우담은 음원 3개 중 제일 높은 타이틀이 21위다. “20위 아래는 솔직히 운빨로도 차트에 들 수 있는데, 20위부턴 아무나 못 뚫죠.” 그러니 맨 처음엔 신주놀 제작진도 정우담에게 20위를 조건으로 걸었던 것이다. 20위라는 라인이 아주 견고하다. 빗장 걸어 잠갔다고 해도 과언이 아니다. 다른 멤버도 동조한다. “저희도 일주일째 19위에 알박기잖아요. 지옥의 구간이 바로 20위라는 겁니다. 그리고 그 사람은 음방도 한 주 돌고 만다면서요?” “오늘로 끝났댔지.” “그럼 이제 순위 떨어질 일밖에 없어요. 저희처럼 듣는 실체가 있는 게 아니고선. 그러니까 마주쳐도 열심히 인지도 올리시라고 응원해줄 수도 있어요.” *** 1시간 뒤. 숙소에서 정우담은 매시간 바뀌는 음원 순위를 확인했다.

Day.G는 물들어왔을 때 노를 젓고자 한 달을 꽉 채워 음악방송에 나가기로 했다. 즉 2주 남았다. 곡비가 너무 크게 책정돼 정말 괜찮으신가 걱정도 되는 우담이었다. 하지만 Day.G에게 주려는 트로피컬 하우스와 걸스힙합은, 프로듀싱(S) 상태에서 데모를 최종본으로 완성시켰다. 3부작 계약이었으니, 유종의 미를 거둔다고 할 수 있다. 그뿐 아니라 인공 눈물을 썼을 때, 저지클럽 비트도 하나 뽑았다. 신주놀 출연자들에겐 들려주지 않았다. 시청자들은 좋아할 수 있어도 정작 출연자들의 취향은 아닐 듯했으니까. ‘애초에 클럽씬에서 나온 장르라.’ MNS 엔터와 상의를 해봐야겠다. 보이그룹 데뷔조의 차후 활동 곡으로 쓸지, 아니면 외부에 팔지를. 이렇듯, 잘하면 상반기 안에 프로듀싱을 S등급으로 올릴 수 있을지 모른다. 그러다 정우담은 대자로 드러누웠다. 어찌 보면 지금 정리하는 계획은 싱어송라이터에서 싱어를 뺀, 송라이터로서의 계획뿐이다. ‘가수로선 어떻지?’ 줄곧 서지안이 했던 말이 머리에 맴돈다. MNS 엔터와의 앨범 투자 미팅에서 들은 얘기. 정우담은 1인 기획사라 음원과 앨범에서 높은 비율을 가져가지만. ‘아무튼 아티스트한테 가장 수익이 높은 건, 공연이야. 음원, 음반 판매량은 티켓 파워를 가늠하는 용도로밖에 안 여겨질 만큼.” 가수가 되고 나니 정우담도 알겠다. 지금도 많이 벌게 돼 감사함을 느끼지만, 공연장을 채우는 날이 온다면 비교도 안 되게 매출이 발생할 것이다. “공연이라.” 콘서트를 열려면 당연히 곡이 많아야 한다. 서지안의 말대로 콘서트에 와줄 팬덤의 코어력을 확인하기 위해선 음반도 잘 팔려야 한다. 현재 정우담의 데뷔 앨범은 5천 장이 풀렸고, 그중 4천 장이 팔렸다. 음원은 강해도 앨범은 그렇지 않았다. ‘사실 이것도 이렇게나 팔릴 줄은 몰랐는데.’ 여하튼, 언젠간 콘서트를 하고 싶단 막연하기만 했던 생각. 그런데 계속 막연하게 생각해선 안 되겠다. ‘나는 안 그럴 줄 알았더니.’ 연습생들은 데뷔가 꿈이고, 데뷔를 하면 1위를 꿈꾼다. 그리고 1위를 하면 콘서트와 투어를 꿈꾸게 된다. 여느 아티스트들은 더 많은 팬을 만나고자 그럴 수 있지만, 우담처럼 오로지 돈 때문에 각오가 선 사람들도 있을 것이다. 곰돌이들은 3웅이 새로 구해온 드럼통을 잘라 미끄럼틀을 만들고. 우담은 1억 모으기보다 더 큰 계획을 만들었다. * 다음날, 정우담은 일본 게임사와 잡힌 미팅 시간보다 일찍 MNS 엔터에 출근했다. 오전에도 1층을 오가는 연습생들이 많다. 학생이 아니거나, 자퇴를 했거나. 공통점은 정우담을 보고 그냥 지나치지 않는단 것이다. “안녕하세요!” “우담 선배님!” “이거, 저 먹으려고 사온 건데 드세요!” 흰 우유를 주는 연습생도 있어 사양했다. “우유 마시면 설사해서요.” 알고 싶지 않은 정보에 연습생도 우유를 마실 마음이 가셨다. 그리고 연습생들은 엘리베이터에서 버튼을 누를 수조차 없는 6층으로 올라간 정우담은, 전무를 만나러 왔으나 어째선지 서지안도 도착해 있길래 말을 걸었다. “어? 오전부터 무슨 일이야?” “송캠프 관련으로 회의. 너 내 컴백 곡 송캠프에 오기로 했다며?” 정우담은 전부터 궁금했었다. 그는 모든 음악 장르를 할 수 있는 올라운더지만, 많은 스타 작곡가들은 주력 장르에 특화돼 있다. 그런 사람들이 이달 말, MNS 송캠프에 온다. 그러니 어찌 가지 않을 수 있겠는가. “많이 배우고 싶어서.” “아무래도 얼마 전에 기사로 떠들썩했었으니까, 대표님은 내 다음 앨범에 네 곡을 넣지 않으려고 하시거든? 넣더라도 나중에 말이야.” “그게 좋지 않나?” “근데 타이틀은 원래부터 내가 골랐어. 난 노래만 좋으면 돼.” 부담을 주려는 건지, 송캠프에서 유명한 작곡가들을 봐도 기죽지 말라고 하는 소린지. 우담은 알겠다며 고개를 끄덕이고는 전무와 나누려던 의견을 먼저 서지안에게 물었다. “가수들마다 컴백 주기가 다르잖아?” “다르지. 3개월마다 하는 팀도 있고, 1년 넘게 걸리기도 하고.” “한 달에 한 번씩 하면 안 돼?” “···어? 누가?” “내가.” 서지안은 늘 정우담에게 충격을 받지만, 장담컨대 오늘이 가장 충격이 강했다. 그녀는 관자놀이를 주무르며 되물었다. “월간 땡땡땡 해서 매달 디지털 음원을 내는 분이 계시긴 해. 네가 말하는 컴백도 그런 식인 거지?” “응? 이번처럼 음방 일주일씩 돌고, 뮤직비디오는 타이틀 하나만 만들게.” “아니, 아니, 아니 아니아니아니아니 아니!” “왜 화를 내고 그래?” 화가 난 게 아니다. 황당해서 뭐라 말할지 생각이 안 난 것이다. “너 프로듀싱도 하기로 했잖아?” “채윤 씨랑 다빈 씨 그룹은 올해 말에 데뷔하고, 데뷔하더라도 내가 활동 관두는 건 아니니까.” 맙소사. 잦은 미디어 노출이 꼭 장점만은 아니다. 더구나 당사자와 스탭들이 죽어 나갈 것이다. ‘그럼에도 정 해야겠다면 할 수야 있겠지.’ 좀 전에 말한 월간 디지털 음원을 내는 가수도 그중 하나가 메가히트를 쳤다. 그런 식으로 하나만 건져도 대박이지만, 곡 작업만 하느라 아예 다른 활동을 못 하게 될 수도 있다. ‘그렇지만 정우담은···.’ 일단 작업 속도가, 7년 차인 서지안조차 이런 사람을 본 적 없을 만큼 빠르다. 게다가 다양한 장르를 소화할 수 있으며, 가창력도 수준급이다. 또한 데뷔 앨범의 3곡을 30위권 안에 다 집어넣었고, 한동안은 내려오지 않을 텐데 매달 음원을 낸다? 심지어 다른 가수들에게 곡도 팔고 있다. ‘100위 안에 몇 곡이나 녀석의 곡이 될지.’ 어디까지나 잘됐을 때의 이야기. 그래도. “뭐, 재미는 있겠다.”","completion":"< Comeback Cycle > Late night in April. The weather is still chilly, but two men sit on the terrace of a bar, enjoying the attention of passersby. They are a duo band named Mad C.S. 'It's cold.' Occasionally, women who recognize them pass by, but they don't show that they're cold. \\"Mad C.S?! What are you doing here?\\" \\"We're observing people. After all, songs are about people's stories.\\" \\"Wow, that's cool.\\" Though she said that, she thought they were showing off and continued on her way. Then. The manager came with a tray of drinks and snacks. \\"Everything's fine, but at least until next year, stop hitting on women.\\" Mad C.S, in their early to mid-twenties and only in their second year, think the entertainment industry is easy because they tasted popularity early on. They're full of pretense. The manager thinks they need tighter management, but the company lets them off as long as they don't make the crime news. They're performing beyond expectations, a miracle for a mid-sized company. There's no end to event inquiries. They actually have talent in song making and performance, and their rates are still not high, so it's not too much. \\"Manager, it's the other way around. They were hitting on us.\\" \\"Eat up quickly. It's cold, so let's go inside.\\" \\"But why is the Shinju Play casting confirmation so late?\\" The new face of the music festival on the weekend variety show 'Shinju Play' was supposed to be Mad C.S. They had a meeting with the production team two weeks ago. They were puzzled by the lack of a firm answer. In fact, the manager had already informed the CEO. The CEO told the manager to let the kids know while buying them drinks. \\"If you're so interested, why don't you search on SNS?\\" \\"Does terrestrial TV inform you of the results on SNS?\\" Grumbling, the two members turned on SNS. -Today, Shinju Play visited MNS Entertainment -It must be for the music festival, right? -If they're going to record, wouldn't it be? -A friend who's a trainee there told me they met Jeong Woo-dam at Shinju Play -Oh, high-quality insider info Only then did they understand why they were told to check SNS. Because eyewitness accounts are fastest on SNS. No articles had been published yet. \\"Hyung, don't tell me the new face spot for the music festival...\\" \\"If you guys had been a bit more humble at the meeting, it wouldn't have been taken away.\\" Still, the manager was wary of the members' reactions. They may be arrogant and irritating, but they're not the type to cause a scene. But now, who knows what might happen. Shinju Play was an opportunity to greatly increase their recognition. But. \\"Jeong Woo-dam, huh. If it's him, then what.\\" \\"...Huh? Are you guys okay?\\" \\"It's not great, but we don't really see him as a rival.\\" They thought it was better to lose the Shinju Play ticket to Jeong Woo-dam than to another rising star. \\"Because he's below us.\\" \\"Jeong Woo-dam is below you? In what way?\\" \\"Music chart rankings.\\" Mad C.S is at 19th, and Jeong Woo-dam's highest title among three songs is at 21st. \\"Honestly, below 20th place, you can get on the chart by luck, but from 20th place, not just anyone can break through.\\" That's why the Shinju Play production team initially set the condition of reaching 20th place for Jeong Woo-dam. The line of 20th place is very solid. It's as if it's locked tight. The other member agrees. \\"We've been stuck at 19th place for a week. The hellish section is right at 20th place. And that guy is only doing music shows for a week, right?\\" \\"They said today's the last day.\\" \\"Then there's nothing left but to drop in rankings. Unless they have a real listener base like us. So even if we run into him, we can encourage him to work hard to raise his recognition.\\" *** An hour later. At the dorm, Jeong Woo-dam checked the constantly changing music chart rankings. [19th place (2↑) Jeong Woo-dam (ft. Shin Chae-yun) - www.] [20th place (1↓) Mad C.S – Unlucky] \\"Oh, climbed two steps.\\" Covers and challenges spread from other tracks, but strangely, the title track climbs well in rankings. While the other tracks are polarizing, the title track seems to concentrate firepower because it's universally liked. Meanwhile, the bears didn't seem to know when to leave the playground. 'They're playing well on the jungle gym.' Another name for it is the murder maze. If you slip while trying to climb to the top, you fall, hitting the bars with a bang. You crawl out with no part of your body unharmed. But atop that, little 4woong fearlessly runs around. Moreover, it's made of rebar, so it's thinner than real jungle gyms, and the gaps are wider. You could even do pull-ups. Then, inevitably, an accident happened. He fell from the edge. Before he could fall... He did a somersault in the air and landed. -Kishik! \\"Only the little ones should play on the jungle gym.\\" They made two swings, but the little one didn't seem interested. He climbed back on the jungle gym. Instead, the chief 1woong and foodie 2woong happily swung together. \\"If 2woong can swing on it, it must be well made.\\" Next in line to swing were the engineering student 5woong and cowboy 6woong. -Hotdoo hotdoo. Just then, 3woong returned, rolling a drum he had found. But that wasn't the end of his gains. He took out items from the pocket vest and placed them on the altar. Then he went straight to the jungle gym to play. \\"Indeed, the vest that slightly increases the item acquisition rate.\\" With the lamp hat also slightly increasing the search acquisition rate, the effect on items must have improved. [Dancing Knee Pads×2 / Rare] -Reduces knee damage by 50% when worn -Allows you to sing without your voice shaking even while dancing It would have been a useless item if the urban dance seed hadn't appeared. 'Well, seasoned dance singers do live with arthritis.' Of course, Woo-dam wouldn't dance as vigorously as they do. But he particularly likes the second option. And the other item is. [Fruit Tin Case / Premium] -Allows you to store fruits without confusion Until now, Woo-dam had to write down descriptions separately because he couldn't see them when taking fruits and items out of the tree bag, and he stored fruits in vitamin containers with labels. In fact, it's an item that could be done without. But he was curious. Click. When he opened the metal tin case, there were no compartments inside. He put in a Vocal Technique (A) fruit to test it. [Effective Practice (Vocal Technique) / Single-use 2 hours] -Even the masters don't skip practice -Discover your own style and techniques through imitation Words were engraved on the lid of the tin case. \\"So that's what it was?\\" He also put in an Aura (A) fruit. Both are the size of rabbit droppings and the same color, so it's hard to tell them apart by sight, but touching them with a finger changes the description. [Charm (Aura) / Single-use 2 hours] -That day, they will dream of you He moved all the fruits from the vitamin containers. He grouped them by type. To eat for the Shinju Play music festival. All the songs he composed on the spot today were first demos. To complete them, he plans to eat composition-related fruits, and for studio filming and the music festival stage, he'll eat visual and vocal-related fruits. The tin case is very convenient. Today's adventure by 3woong was successful. \\"Thanks. I'll give you gold coins in a few days.\\" A large sum will be deposited sequentially. Two million won for three years of licensing fees for <Harmonize>, plus one month's severance pay. 'It won't reach three million even with the money I have.' But it's enough to upgrade Sampling (B) and Rhythm & Soul (B) to grade A, and to buy a gayageum. Then he'll be able to upload <Little by Little>. But what comes after is important. Jeong Woo-dam has set a goal. \\"One hundred million.\\" Because he has seen the world of Producing (S). Using just 0.4mL of artificial tears for a mere 30 minutes. So it would be wise to save money from now on, but instead, he decided to upgrade the two trees to grade A to speed things up. Fortunately, he had something to rely on. Kota Entertainment. 'They said they'd prepare the song fees by the time Start Over activities end.' That's for two songs at once. Day.G decided to go all out for a month on music broadcasts, so there are two weeks left. Woo-dam was worried because the song fees were set so high. But the tropical house and girl's hip-hop songs for Day.G were completed as final demos in the state of Producing (S). It was a trilogy contract, so it could be said that they ended on a high note. Not only that, but when he used artificial tears, he also produced a Jersey club beat. He didn't play it for the Shinju Play participants. It seemed like the viewers would like it, but it wasn't really the participants' taste. 'After all, it's a genre that originated from the club scene.' He'll have to discuss it with MNS Entertainment. Whether to use it for the debut group's future activities or to sell it externally. Thus, he might be able to raise Producing to grade S within the first half of the year. Then, Jeong Woo-dam lay sprawled out. In a way, the plan he's organizing now is just that of a songwriter, without the singer. 'What about as a singer?' He keeps thinking about what Seo Ji-an said. The conversation they had at the album investment meeting with MNS Entertainment. Jeong Woo-dam, as a one-man agency, takes a high percentage from music and album sales. 'Anyway, the most profitable thing for an artist is performing. Music and album sales are only considered as a measure of ticket power.' Now that he's a singer, Woo-dam understands. He's grateful for earning a lot now, but if the day comes when he fills a concert hall, the revenue will be incomparable. \\"A concert.\\" To hold a concert, you naturally need a lot of songs. As Seo Ji-an said, to check the core strength of the fandom that will come to the concert, the album must sell well. Jeong Woo-dam's debut album released 5,000 copies, and 4,000 have been sold. His music is strong, but not his album sales. 'In fact, I didn't expect it to sell this much.' Anyway, the vague thought of wanting to hold a concert someday. But he can't keep thinking vaguely. 'I didn't think I would.' Trainees dream of debuting, and once they debut, they dream of reaching number one. And once they hit number one, they dream of concerts and tours. While most artists may do so to meet more fans, there are also people like Woo-dam who are determined solely for the money. The bears are cutting the newly found drum into a slide. Woo-dam made a plan bigger than just saving up one hundred million. * The next day, Jeong Woo-dam arrived at MNS Entertainment earlier than the meeting time with a Japanese game company. There are many trainees coming and going on the first floor in the morning. Either they're not students, or they've dropped out. The common thing is that they don't just pass by without noticing Jeong Woo-dam. \\"Hello!\\" \\"Woo-dam senior!\\" \\"Here, I bought this for myself, but you have it!\\" A trainee even offered him white milk, which he declined. \\"I get diarrhea if I drink milk.\\" The trainee lost the desire to drink milk after hearing information they didn't want to know. And Jeong Woo-dam, who went up to the sixth floor where the trainees couldn't even press the elevator button, came to meet the executive director but happened to run into Seo Ji-an and spoke to her. \\"Huh? What brings you here in the morning?\\" \\"I'm here for a meeting about the song camp. You agreed to come to my comeback song camp, right?\\" Jeong Woo-dam had always been curious. He's an all-rounder who can do all music genres, but many star composers specialize in their main genres. Those people are coming to the MNS song camp at the end of this month. So how could he not go? \\"I want to learn a lot.\\" \\"Since there was a lot of noise in the articles recently, the CEO doesn't want to put your songs in my next album. If they do, it'll be later.\\" \\"Isn't that better?\\" \\"But I've always chosen the title track myself. I just need a good song.\\" Whether she's trying to put pressure on him or telling him not to be intimidated by the famous composers at the song camp. Woo-dam nodded in understanding and asked Seo Ji-an the opinion he was going to share with the executive director. \\"Every singer has a different comeback cycle, right?\\" \\"Yeah. Some do it every three months, some take over a year.\\" \\"Can't you do it once a month?\\" \\"...Huh? Who?\\" \\"Me.\\" Seo Ji-an is always shocked by Jeong Woo-dam, but she was most shocked today. She massaged her temples and asked again. \\"There's someone who releases digital music every month, doing 'Monthly Ding Dong Dang.' Is that what you mean by comeback?\\" \\"Huh? Like this time, doing music shows for a week, and only making a music video for one title.\\" \\"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!\\" \\"Why are you getting angry?\\" She's not angry. She's just so flabbergasted that she doesn't know what to say. \\"You agreed to do producing, right?\\" \\"Chae-yun and Da-bin's group will debut at the end of the year, and even if they debut, it doesn't mean I'll stop my activities.\\" Good heavens. Frequent media exposure isn't always a good thing. Moreover, the participants and staff will be exhausted. 'But if he's determined, it's possible.' The singer who releases digital music every month also had one mega-hit. If you catch just one like that, it's a jackpot, but you might end up doing nothing but song work. 'But Jeong Woo-dam...' First of all, his work speed is so fast that even Seo Ji-an, who's been in the industry for seven years, has never seen anyone like him. He can digest various genres and has excellent vocal skills. He also placed all three tracks from his debut album within the top 30, and they won't come down for a while. Releasing music every month? And he's even selling songs to other singers. 'How many songs within the top 100 will be his?' That's if things go well. Still. \\"Well, it'll be fun.\\""},{"prompt":"\\"this game is probably the most hours ive put into a persona game so far and i gotta say, as much as i enjoy the chars and art. i really dont like playing a calendar simulator \\"hey you cant progress more in tartarus till this date go mess around for the next 25+ ingame days\\" 😴\\" could you give me three possible translations in spanish that sounds natural for native spanish speakers and tell me why","completion":"Here are three possible translations in Spanish that should sound natural for native speakers: 1. \\"Este juego es probablemente en el que más horas he invertido de todos los Persona hasta ahora y, aunque me gustan los personajes y el arte, realmente no disfruto jugar a un simulador de calendario. \\"Oye, no puedes avanzar más en el Tartarus hasta esta fecha, ve a perder el tiempo durante los próximos 25+ días del juego\\" 😴\\" 2. \\"Este es el título de Persona en el que he pasado más horas hasta el momento, y aunque disfruto de los personajes y el diseño gráfico, jugar a un simulador de agenda no me agrada. \\"No puedes seguir en el Tartarus hasta esa fecha, así que anda y entretente con otras cosas por los próximos 25+ días en el juego\\" 😴\\" 3. \\"Probablemente le he dedicado más horas a este juego de Persona que a cualquier otro, me encantan los personajes y el arte y todo eso.

GDB에서 색상을 설정하려면, GDB가 시작될 때 읽는 \`.gdbinit\` 파일에 색상 설정을 추가할 수 있습니다. 사용자 홈 디렉토리에 \`.gdbinit\` 파일을 생성하거나 편집하여 다음과 같은 설정을 추가하세요: \`\`\`bash # 색상 활성화 set style enabled on # 소스 코드의 색상 설정 set style source bg-color \\"black\\" set style source fg-color \\"white\\" # GDB 프롬프트의 색상 설정 set style prompt bg-color \\"blue\\" set style prompt fg-color \\"white\\" # 기타 출력에 대한 색상 설정 set style value bg-color \\"black\\" set style value fg-color \\"green\\" \`\`\` 위 설정은 기본적인 예시이며, \`bg-color\`는 배경색을, \`fg-color\`는 전경색(글자색)을 의미합니다. 색상 값은 \`\\"black\\"\`, \`\\"white\\"\`, \`\\"green\\"\`, \`\\"blue\\"\` 등의 색상 이름이나 RGB 코드를 사용할 수 있습니다. GDB TUI 모드에서 소스 코드에 직접 색상을 입히는 것은 지원되지 않지만, 위 설정을 통해 GDB의 다른 출력 부분에 색상을 추가하여 전반적인 가독성을 향상시킬 수 있습니다. 또한, GDB TUI 모드에서는 아닐지라도, 일부 터미널 에뮬레이터는 구문 강조(Syntax Highlighting) 기능을 제공하여 소스 코드에 색상을 입힐 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, \`vim\`이나 \`emacs\`와 같은 텍스트 에디터를 사용하여 GDB와 함께 디버깅을 수행하면, 에디터의 구문 강조 기능을 활용할 수 있습니다. 마지막으로, GDB에는 직접적인 구문 강조 기능이 없기 때문에, 이러한 기능이 필요하다면 다른 디버깅 도구를 고려해볼 수도 있습니다. 예를 들어, \`Eclipse\`, \`Visual Studio Code\`, \`CLion\` 등의 IDE는 내장된 디버거와 함께 구문 강조 기능을 제공합니다."},{"prompt":"아래 내용을 통해서 tui 모드에서 c++ 코드를 가독성 높여서 보는 방법을 알려줄 수 있나요? gitgit://sourceware.org / binutils-gdb.git / blob ? search: re 2638b3e0d9ca573d4e284f4f26d19409123ebc7b [binutils-gdb.git] / gdb / NEWS 1 What has changed in GDB? 2 (Organized release by release) 3 4 *** Changes since GDB 14 5 6 * Building GDB and GDBserver now requires a C++17 compiler. 7 For example, GCC 9 or later. 8 9 * GDB index now contains information about the main function. This speeds up 10 startup when it is being used for some large binaries. 11 12 * On hosts where threading is available, DWARF reading is now done in 13 the background, resulting in faster startup. This can be controlled 14 using \\"maint set dwarf synchronous\\". 15 16 * Changed commands 17 18 disassemble 19 Attempting to use both the 'r' and 'b' flags with the disassemble 20 command will now give an error. Previously the 'b' flag would 21 always override the 'r' flag. 22 23 maintenance info line-table 24 Add an EPILOGUE-BEGIN column to the output of the command. It indicates 25 if the line is considered the start of the epilgoue, and thus a point at 26 which the frame can be considered destroyed. 27 28 * New commands 29 30 info missing-debug-handler 31 List all the registered missing debug handlers. 32 33 enable missing-debug-handler LOCUS HANDLER 34 disable missing-debug-handler LOCUS HANDLER 35 Enable or disable a missing debug handler with a name matching the 36 regular expression HANDLER, in LOCUS. 37 38 LOCUS can be 'global' to operate on global missing debug handler, 39 'progspace' to operate on handlers within the current program space, 40 or can be a regular expression which is matched against the filename 41 of the primary executable in each program space. 42 43 maintenance info linux-lwps 44 List all LWPs under control of the linux-nat target. 45 46 set remote thread-options-packet 47 show remote thread-options-packet 48 Set/show the use of the thread options packet. 49 50 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 51 52 ** The --remote-debug and --event-loop-debug command line options 53 have been removed. 54 55 ** The --debug command line option now takes an optional comma 56 separated list of components to emit debug for. The currently 57 supported components are: all, threads, event-loop, and remote. 58 If no components are given then threads is assumed. 59 60 ** The 'monitor set remote-debug' and 'monitor set event-loop-debug' 61 command have been removed. 62 63 ** The 'monitor set debug 0|1' command has been extended to take a 64 component name, e.g.: 'monitor set debug COMPONENT off|on'. 65 Possible component names are: all, threads, event-loop, and 66 remote. 67 68 * Python API 69 70 ** New function gdb.notify_mi(NAME, DATA), that emits custom 71 GDB/MI async notification. 72 73 ** New read/write attribute gdb.Value.bytes that contains a bytes 74 object holding the contents of this value. 75 76 ** New module gdb.missing_debug that facilitates dealing with 77 objfiles that are missing any debug information. 78 79 ** New function gdb.missing_debug.register_handler that can register 80 an instance of a sub-class of gdb.missing_debug.MissingDebugInfo 81 as a handler for objfiles that are missing debug information. 82 83 ** New class gdb.missing_debug.MissingDebugInfo which can be 84 sub-classed to create handlers for objfiles with missing debug 85 information. 86 87 ** Stop events now have a \\"details\\" attribute that holds a 88 dictionary that carries the same information as an MI \\"*stopped\\" 89 event. 90 91 ** New function gdb.interrupt(), that interrupts GDB as if the user 92 typed control-c. 93 94 ** New gdb.InferiorThread.ptid_string attribute. This read-only 95 attribute contains the string that appears in the 'Target Id' 96 column of the 'info threads' command output. 97 98 ** It is no longer possible to create new gdb.Progspace object using 99 'gdb.Progspace()', this will result in a TypeError. Progspace 100 objects can still be obtained through calling other API 101 functions, for example 'gdb.current_progspace()'. 102 103 ** User defined attributes can be added to a gdb.Inferior object, 104 these will be stored in the object's new Inferior.__dict__ 105 attribute. 106 107 ** User defined attributes can be added to a gdb.InferiorThread 108 object, these will be stored in the object's new 109 InferiorThread.__dict__ attribute. 110 111 ** New constants gdb.SYMBOL_TYPE_DOMAIN, gdb.SYMBOL_FUNCTION_DOMAIN, 112 and gdb.SEARCH_*_DOMAIN corresponding to all the existing symbol 113 domains. Symbol lookup can now search in multiple domains at 114 once, and can also narrowly search for just a type or function. 115 116 * Debugger Adapter Protocol changes 117 118 ** GDB now emits the \\"process\\" event. 119 120 ** GDB now supports the \\"cancel\\" request. 121 122 ** The \\"attach\\" request now supports specifying the program. 123 124 ** New command \\"set debug dap-log-level\\" controls DAP logging. 125 126 ** The \\"set debug dap-log-file\\" command is now documented. This 127 command was available in GDB 14 but not documented. 128 129 * Guile API 130 131 ** New constants SYMBOL_TYPE_DOMAIN, SYMBOL_FUNCTION_DOMAIN, and 132 SEARCH_*_DOMAIN corresponding to all the existing symbol domains. 133 Symbol lookup can now search in multiple domains at once, and can 134 also narrowly search for just a type or function. 135 136 * New remote packets 137 138 New stop reason: clone 139 Indicates that a clone system call was executed. 140 141 QThreadOptions 142 Enable/disable optional event reporting, on a per-thread basis. 143 Currently supported options are GDB_THREAD_OPTION_CLONE, to enable 144 clone event reporting, and GDB_THREAD_OPTION_EXIT to enable thread 145 exit event reporting. 146 147 QThreadOptions in qSupported 148 The qSupported packet allows GDB to inform the stub it supports the 149 QThreadOptions packet, and the qSupported response can contain the 150 set of thread options the remote stub supports. 151 152 *** Changes in GDB 14 153 154 * GDB now supports the AArch64 Scalable Matrix Extension 2 (SME2), which 155 includes a new 512 bit lookup table register named ZT0. 156 157 * GDB now supports the AArch64 Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), which includes 158 a new matrix register named ZA, a new thread register TPIDR2 and a new vector 159 length register SVG (streaming vector granule). GDB also supports tracking 160 ZA state across signal frames. 161 162 Some features are still under development or are dependent on ABI specs that 163 are still in alpha stage. For example, manual function calls with ZA state 164 don't have any special handling, and tracking of SVG changes based on 165 DWARF information is still not implemented, but there are plans to do so in 166 the future. 167 168 * GDB now recognizes the NO_COLOR environment variable and disables 169 styling according to the spec. See https://no-color.org/. 170 Styling can be re-enabled with \\"set style enabled on\\". 171 172 * The AArch64 'org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth' Pointer Authentication feature string 173 has been deprecated in favor of the 'org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth_v2' feature 174 string. 175 176 * GDB now has some support for integer types larger than 64 bits. 177 178 * Removed targets and native configurations 179 180 GDB no longer supports AIX 4.x, AIX 5.x and AIX 6.x. The minimum supported 181 AIX version is now AIX 7.1. 182 183 * Multi-target feature configuration 184 185 GDB now supports the individual configuration of remote targets' feature 186 sets. Based on the current selection of a target, the commands 'set remote 187 <name>-packet (on|off|auto)' and 'show remote <name>-packet' can be used to 188 configure a target's feature packet and to display its configuration, 189 respectively. 190 191 The individual packet sizes can be configured and shown using the commands 192 ** 'set remote memory-read-packet-size (number of bytes|fixed|limit)' 193 ** 'set remote memory-write-packet-size (number of bytes|fixed|limit)' 194 ** 'show remote memory-read-packet-size' 195 ** 'show remote memory-write-packet-size'. 196 197 The configuration of the packet itself, as well as the size of a memory-read 198 or memory-write packet applies to the currently selected target (if 199 available). If no target is selected, it applies to future remote 200 connections. Similarly, the show commands print the configuration of the 201 currently selected target. If no remote target is selected, the default 202 configuration for future connections is shown. 203 204 * GDB has initial built-in support for the Debugger Adapter Protocol. 205 This support requires that GDB be built with Python scripting 206 enabled. 207 208 * For the break command, multiple uses of the 'thread' or 'task' 209 keywords will now give an error instead of just using the thread or 210 task id from the last instance of the keyword. E.g.: 211 break foo thread 1 thread 2 212 will now give an error rather than using 'thread 2'. 213 214 * For the watch command, multiple uses of the 'task' keyword will now 215 give an error instead of just using the task id from the last 216 instance of the keyword. E.g.: 217 watch my_var task 1 task 2 218 will now give an error rather than using 'task 2'. The 'thread' 219 keyword already gave an error when used multiple times with the 220 watch command, this remains unchanged. 221 222 * The 'set print elements' setting now helps when printing large arrays. 223 If an array would otherwise exceed max-value-size, but 'print elements' 224 is set such that the size of elements to print is less than or equal 225 to 'max-value-size', GDB will now still print the array, however only 226 'max-value-size' worth of data will be added into the value history. 227 228 * For both the break and watch commands, it is now invalid to use both 229 the 'thread' and 'task' keywords within the same command. For 230 example the following commnds will now give an error: 231 break foo thread 1 task 1 232 watch var thread 2 task 3 233 234 * The printf command now accepts a '%V' output format which will 235 format an expression just as the 'print' command would. Print 236 options can be placed withing '[...]' after the '%V' to modify how 237 the value is printed. E.g: 238 printf \\"%V\\", some_array 239 printf \\"%V[-array-indexes on]\\", some_array 240 will print the array without, or with array indexes included, just 241 as the array would be printed by the 'print' command. This 242 functionality is also available for dprintf when dprintf-style is 243 'gdb'. 244 245 * When the printf command requires a string to be fetched from the 246 inferior, GDB now uses the existing 'max-value-size' setting to the 247 limit the memory allocated within GDB. The default 'max-value-size' 248 is 64k. To print longer strings you should increase 249 'max-value-size'. 250 251 * The Ada 2022 Enum_Rep and Enum_Val attributes are now supported. 252 253 * The Ada 2022 target name symbol ('@') is now supported by the Ada 254 expression parser. 255 256 * The 'list' command now accepts '.' as an argument, which tells GDB to 257 print the location around the point of execution within the current frame. 258 If the inferior hasn't started yet, the command will print around the 259 beginning of the 'main' function. 260 261 * Using the 'list' command with no arguments in a situation where the 262 command would attempt to list past the end of the file now warns the 263 user that the end of file has been reached, refers the user to the 264 newly added '.' argument 265 266 * Breakpoints can now be inferior-specific. This is similar to the 267 existing thread-specific breakpoint support. Breakpoint conditions 268 can include the 'inferior' keyword followed by an inferior id (as 269 displayed in the 'info inferiors' output). It is invalid to use the 270 'inferior' keyword with either the 'thread' or 'task' keywords when 271 creating a breakpoint. 272 273 * New convenience function \\"_shell\\", to execute a shell command and 274 return the result. This lets you run shell commands in expressions. 275 Some examples: 276 277 (gdb) p _shell(\\"true\\") 278 1 = 0 279 (gdb) p _shell(\\"false\\") 280 2 = 1 281 (gdb) break func if _shell(\\"some command\\") == 0 282 283 * Configure changes 284 285 --additional-debug-dirs=PATHs 286 287 Provide a colon-separated list of additional directories to search for 288 separate debug info. These directories are added to the default value of 289 the 'debug-file-directory' GDB parameter. 290 291 * New commands 292 293 set debug breakpoint on|off 294 show debug breakpoint 295 Print additional debug messages about breakpoint insertion and removal. 296 297 maintenance print record-instruction [ N ] 298 Print the recorded information for a given instruction. If N is not given 299 prints how GDB would undo the last instruction executed. If N is negative, 300 prints how GDB would undo the N-th previous instruction, and if N is 301 positive, it prints how GDB will redo the N-th following instruction. 302 303 maintenance info frame-unwinders 304 List the frame unwinders currently in effect, starting with the highest 305 priority. 306 307 maintenance wait-for-index-cache 308 Wait until all pending writes to the index cache have completed. 309 310 set always-read-ctf on|off 311 show always-read-ctf 312 When off, CTF is only read if DWARF is not present. When on, CTF is 313 read regardless of whether DWARF is present. Off by default. 314 315 info main 316 Get main symbol to identify entry point into program. 317 318 set tui mouse-events [on|off] 319 show tui mouse-events 320 When on (default), mouse clicks control the TUI and can be accessed by 321 Python extensions. When off, mouse clicks are handled by the terminal, 322 enabling terminal-native text selection. 323 324 * MI changes 325 326 ** MI version 1 has been removed. 327 328 ** mi now reports 'no-history' as a stop reason when hitting the end of the 329 reverse execution history. 330 331 ** When creating a thread-specific breakpoint using the '-p' option, 332 the -break-insert command would report the 'thread' field twice in 333 the reply. The content of both fields was always identical. This 334 has now been fixed; the 'thread' field will be reported just once 335 for thread-specific breakpoints, or not at all for breakpoints 336 without a thread restriction. The same is also true for the 'task' 337 field of an Ada task-specific breakpoint. 338 339 ** It is no longer possible to create a thread-specific breakpoint for 340 a thread that doesn't exist using '-break-insert -p ID'. Creating 341 breakpoints for non-existent threads is not allowed when using the 342 CLI, that the MI allowed it was a long standing bug, which has now 343 been fixed. 344 345 ** The '--simple-values' argument to the '-stack-list-arguments', 346 '-stack-list-locals', '-stack-list-variables', and '-var-list-children' 347 commands now takes reference types into account: that is, a value is now 348 considered simple if it is neither an array, structure, or union, nor a 349 reference to an array, structure, or union. (Previously all references were 350 considered simple.) Support for this feature can be verified by using the 351 '-list-features' command, which should contain \\"simple-values-ref-types\\". 352 353 ** The -break-insert command now accepts a '-g thread-group-id' option 354 to allow for the creation of inferior-specific breakpoints. 355 356 ** The bkpt tuple, which appears in breakpoint-created notifications, 357 and in the result of the -break-insert command can now include an 358 optional 'inferior' field for both the main breakpoint, and each 359 location, when the breakpoint is inferior-specific. 360 361 * Python API 362 363 ** gdb.ThreadExitedEvent added. Emits a ThreadEvent. 364 365 ** The gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.name attribute is now read-only. 366 367 ** The name argument passed to gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.__init__ must 368 now be of type 'str' otherwise a TypeError will be raised. 369 370 ** The gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.enabled attribute can now only accept 371 values of type 'bool'. Changing this attribute will now 372 invalidate GDB's frame-cache, which means GDB will need to 373 rebuild its frame-cache when next required - either with, or 374 without the particular unwinder, depending on how 'enabled' was 375 changed. 376 377 ** New methods added to the gdb.PendingFrame class. These methods 378 have the same behaviour as the corresponding methods on 379 gdb.Frame. The new methods are: 380 381 - gdb.PendingFrame.name: Return the name for the frame's 382 function, or None. 383 - gdb.PendingFrame.is_valid: Return True if the pending frame 384 object is valid. 385 - gdb.PendingFrame.pc: Return the pc register value for this 386 frame. 387 - gdb.PendingFrame.language: Return a string containing the 388 language for this frame, or None. 389 - gdb.PendingFrame.find_sal: Return a gdb.Symtab_and_line 390 object for the current location within the pending frame, or 391 None. 392 - gdb.PendingFrame.block: Return a gdb.Block for the current 393 pending frame, or None. 394 - gdb.PendingFrame.function: Return a gdb.Symbol for the 395 current pending frame, or None. 396 397 ** The frame-id passed to gdb.PendingFrame.create_unwind_info can 398 now use either an integer or a gdb.Value object for each of its 399 'sp', 'pc', and 'special' attributes. 400 401 ** A new class gdb.unwinder.FrameId has been added. Instances of 402 this class are constructed with 'sp' (stack-pointer) and 'pc' 403 (program-counter) values, and can be used as the frame-id when 404 calling gdb.PendingFrame.create_unwind_info. 405 406 ** It is now no longer possible to sub-class the 407 gdb.disassembler.DisassemblerResult type. 408 409 ** The Disassembler API from the gdb.disassembler module has been 410 extended to include styling support: 411 412 - The DisassemblerResult class can now be initialized with a list 413 of parts. Each part represents part of the disassembled 414 instruction along with the associated style information. This 415 list of parts can be accessed with the new 416 DisassemblerResult.parts property. 417 418 - New constants gdb.disassembler.STYLE_* representing all the 419 different styles part of an instruction might have. 420 421 - New methods DisassembleInfo.text_part and 422 DisassembleInfo.address_part which are used to create the new 423 styled parts of a disassembled instruction. 424 425 - Changes are backwards compatible, the older API can still be 426 used to disassemble instructions without styling. 427 428 ** New function gdb.execute_mi(COMMAND, [ARG]...), that invokes a 429 GDB/MI command and returns the output as a Python dictionary. 430 431 ** New function gdb.block_signals(). This returns a context manager 432 that blocks any signals that GDB needs to handle itself. 433 434 ** New class gdb.Thread. This is a subclass of threading.Thread 435 that calls gdb.block_signals in its \\"start\\" method. 436 437 ** gdb.parse_and_eval now has a new \\"global_context\\" parameter. 438 This can be used to request that the parse only examine global 439 symbols. 440 441 ** gdb.Inferior now has a new \\"arguments\\" attribute. This holds the 442 command-line arguments to the inferior, if known. 443 444 ** gdb.Inferior now has a new \\"main_name\\" attribute. This holds the 445 name of the inferior's \\"main\\", if known. 446 447 ** gdb.Inferior now has new methods \\"clear_env\\", \\"set_env\\", and 448 \\"unset_env\\". These can be used to modify the inferior's 449 environment before it is started. 450 451 ** gdb.Value now has the 'assign' method. 452 453 ** gdb.Value now has the 'to_array' method. This converts an 454 array-like Value to an array. 455 456 ** gdb.Progspace now has the new method \\"objfile_for_address\\". This 457 returns the gdb.Objfile, if any, that covers a given address. 458 459 ** gdb.Breakpoint now has an \\"inferior\\" attribute. If the 460 Breakpoint object is inferior specific then this attribute holds 461 the inferior-id (an integer). If the Breakpoint object is not 462 inferior specific, then this field contains None. This field can 463 be written too. 464 465 ** gdb.Type now has the \\"is_array_like\\" and \\"is_string_like\\" 466 methods. These reflect GDB's internal idea of whether a type 467 might be array- or string-like, even if they do not have the 468 corresponding type code. 469 470 ** gdb.ValuePrinter is a new class that can be used as the base 471 class for the result of applying a pretty-printer. As a base 472 class, it signals to gdb that the printer may implement new 473 pretty-printer methods. 474 475 ** New attribute Progspace.symbol_file. This attribute holds the 476 gdb.Objfile that corresponds to Progspace.filename (when 477 Progspace.filename is not None), otherwise, this attribute is 478 itself None. 479 480 ** New attribute Progspace.executable_filename. This attribute 481 holds a string containing a file name set by the \\"exec-file\\" or 482 \\"file\\" commands, or None if no executable file is set. This 483 isn't the exact string passed by the user to these commands; the 484 file name will have been partially resolved to an absolute file 485 name. 486 487 ** A new executable_changed event registry is available. This event 488 emits ExecutableChangedEvent objects, which have 'progspace' (a 489 gdb.Progspace) and 'reload' (a Boolean) attributes. This event 490 is emitted when gdb.Progspace.executable_filename changes. 491 492 ** New event registries gdb.events.new_progspace and 493 gdb.events.free_progspace, these emit NewProgspaceEvent and 494 FreeProgspaceEvent event types respectively. Both of these event 495 types have a single 'progspace' attribute, which is the 496 gdb.Progspace that is either being added to GDB, or removed from 497 GDB. 498 499 ** gdb.LazyString now implements the __str__ method. 500 501 ** New method gdb.Frame.static_link that returns the outer frame 502 of a nested function frame. 503 504 *** Changes in GDB 13 505 506 * MI version 1 is deprecated, and will be removed in GDB 14. 507 508 * GDB now supports dumping memory tag data for AArch64 MTE. It also supports 509 reading memory tag data for AArch64 MTE from core files generated by 510 the gcore command or the Linux kernel. 511 512 When a process uses memory-mapped pages protected by memory tags (for 513 example, AArch64 MTE), this additional information will be recorded in 514 the core file in the event of a crash or if GDB generates a core file 515 from the current process state. GDB will show this additional information 516 automatically, or through one of the memory-tag subcommands. 517 518 * Scheduler-locking and new threads 519 520 When scheduler-locking is in effect, only the current thread may run 521 when the inferior is resumed. However, previously, new threads 522 created by the resumed thread would still be able to run free. Now, 523 they are held stopped. 524 525 * \\"info breakpoints\\" now displays enabled breakpoint locations of 526 disabled breakpoints as in the \\"y-\\" state. For example: 527 528 (gdb) info breakpoints 529 Num Type Disp Enb Address What 530 1 breakpoint keep n <MULTIPLE> 531 1.1 y- 0x00000000000011b6 in ... 532 1.2 y- 0x00000000000011c2 in ... 533 1.3 n 0x00000000000011ce in ... 534 535 * Support for Thread Local Storage (TLS) variables on FreeBSD arm and 536 aarch64 architectures. 537 538 * GDB now supports hardware watchpoints on FreeBSD/Aarch64. 539 540 * Remove support for building against Python 2, it is now only possible to 541 build GDB against Python 3. 542 543 * DBX mode has been removed. 544 545 * GDB now honours the DWARF prologue_end line-table entry flag the compiler can 546 emit to indicate where a breakpoint should be placed to break in a function 547 past its prologue. 548 549 * Completion now also offers \\"NUMBER\\" for \\"set\\" commands that accept 550 a numeric argument and the \\"unlimited\\" keyword. For example: 551 552 (gdb) set width <TAB> 553 NUMBER unlimited 554 555 and consequently: 556 557 (gdb) complete set width 558 set width NUMBER 559 set width unlimited 560 561 * Disassembler styling using libopcodes. GDB now supports 562 disassembler styling using libopcodes. This is only available for 563 some targets (currently x86 and RISC-V). For unsupported targets 564 Python Pygments is still used. For supported targets, libopcodes 565 styling is used by default. 566 567 * The Windows native target now supports target async. 568 569 * gdb now supports zstd compressed debug sections (ELFCOMPRESS_ZSTD) for ELF. 570 571 * The format of 'disassemble /r' and 'record instruction-history /r' 572 has changed. The instruction bytes could now be grouped together, 573 and displayed in the endianness of the instruction. This is the 574 same layout as used by GNU objdump when disassembling. 575 576 There is now 'disassemble /b' and 'record instruction-history /b' 577 which will always display the instructions bytes one at a time in 578 memory order, that is, the byte at the lowest address first. 579 580 For both /r and /b GDB is now better at using whitespace in order to 581 align the disassembled instruction text. 582 583 * The TUI no longer styles the source and assembly code highlighted by 584 the current position indicator by default. You can however 585 re-enable styling using the new \\"set style tui-current-position\\" 586 command. 587 588 * New convenience variable _inferior_thread_count contains the number 589 of live threads in the current inferior. 590 591 * When a breakpoint with multiple code locations is hit, GDB now prints 592 the code location using the syntax <breakpoint_number>.<location_number> 593 such as in: 594 Thread 1 \\"zeoes\\" hit Breakpoint 2.3, some_func () at zeoes.c:8 595 596 * When a breakpoint is hit, GDB now sets the convenience variables _hit_bpnum 597 and _hit_locno to the hit breakpoint number and code location number. 598 This allows to disable the last hit breakpoint using 599 (gdb) disable _hit_bpnum 600 or disable only the specific breakpoint code location using 601 (gdb) disable _hit_bpnum._hit_locno 602 These commands can be used inside the command list of a breakpoint to 603 automatically disable the just encountered breakpoint (or the just 604 encountered specific breakpoint code location). 605 When a breakpoint has only one location, _hit_locno is set to 1 so that 606 (gdb) disable _hit_bpnum._hit_locno 607 and 608 (gdb) disable _hit_bpnum 609 are both disabling the breakpoint. 610 611 * New commands 612 613 maintenance set ignore-prologue-end-flag on|off 614 maintenance show ignore-prologue-end-flag 615 This setting, which is off by default, controls whether GDB ignores the 616 PROLOGUE-END flag from the line-table when skipping prologue. This can be 617 used to force GDB to use prologue analyzers if the line-table is constructed 618 from erroneous debug information. 619 620 set print nibbles [on|off] 621 show print nibbles 622 This controls whether the 'print/t' command will display binary values 623 in groups of four bits, known as \\"nibbles\\". The default is 'off'. 624 625 maintenance set libopcodes-styling on|off 626 maintenance show libopcodes-styling 627 These can be used to force off libopcodes based styling, the Python 628 Pygments styling will then be used instead. 629 630 set style disassembler comment 631 show style disassembler comment 632 set style disassembler immediate 633 show style disassembler immediate 634 set style disassembler mnemonic 635 show style disassembler mnemonic 636 set style disassembler register 637 show style disassembler register 638 set style disassembler address 639 show style disassembler address 640 set style disassembler symbol 641 show style disassembler symbol 642 For targets that support libopcodes based styling, these settings 643 control how various aspects of the disassembler output are styled. 644 The 'disassembler address' and 'disassembler symbol' styles are 645 aliases for the 'address' and 'function' styles respectively. 646 647 maintenance print frame-id [ LEVEL ] 648 Print GDB's internal frame-id for the frame at LEVEL. If LEVEL is 649 not given, then print the frame-id for the currently selected frame. 650 651 set debug infcall on|off 652 show debug infcall 653 Print additional debug messages about inferior function calls. 654 655 set debug solib on|off 656 show debug solib 657 Print additional debug messages about shared library handling. 658 659 set style tui-current-position [on|off] 660 Whether to style the source and assembly code highlighted by the 661 TUI's current position indicator. The default is off. 662 663 set print characters LIMIT 664 show print characters 665 This new setting is like 'set print elements', but controls how many 666 characters of a string are printed. This functionality used to be 667 covered by 'set print elements', but it can be controlled separately 668 now. LIMIT can be set to a numerical value to request that particular 669 character count, to 'unlimited' to print all characters of a string, 670 or to 'elements', which is also the default, to follow the setting of 671 'set print elements' as it used to be. 672 673 print -characters LIMIT 674 This new option to the 'print' command has the same effect as a temporary 675 use of 'set print characters'. 676 677 * Changed commands 678 679 document user-defined 680 It is now possible to document user-defined aliases. 681 When a user-defined alias is documented, the help and apropos commands 682 use the provided documentation instead of the documentation of the 683 aliased command. 684 Documenting a user-defined alias is particularly useful when the alias 685 is a set of nested 'with' commands to avoid showing the help of 686 the with command for an alias that will in fact launch the 687 last command given in the nested commands. 688 689 maintenance info line-table 690 Add a PROLOGUE-END column to the output which indicates that an 691 entry corresponds to an address where a breakpoint should be placed 692 to be at the first instruction past a function's prologue. 693 694 * Removed commands 695 696 set debug aix-solib on|off 697 show debug aix-solib 698 set debug solib-frv on|off 699 show debug solib-frv 700 Removed in favor of \\"set/show debug solib\\". 701 702 maintenance info program-spaces 703 This command now includes a 'Core File' column which indicates the 704 name of the core file associated with each program space. 705 706 * New targets 707 708 GNU/Linux/LoongArch (gdbserver) loongarch*-*-linux* 709 710 GNU/Linux/CSKY (gdbserver) csky*-*linux* 711 712 AMDGPU amdgcn-*-* 713 714 * MI changes 715 716 ** The async record stating the stopped reason 'breakpoint-hit' now 717 contains an optional field locno giving the code location number 718 when the breakpoint has multiple code locations. 719 720 * Python API 721 722 ** GDB will now reformat the doc string for gdb.Command and 723 gdb.Parameter sub-classes to remove unnecessary leading 724 whitespace from each line before using the string as the help 725 output. 726 727 ** New function gdb.format_address(ADDRESS, PROGSPACE, ARCHITECTURE), 728 that formats ADDRESS as 'address <symbol+offset>', where symbol is 729 looked up in PROGSPACE, and ARCHITECTURE is used to format address. 730 This is the same format that GDB uses when printing address, symbol, 731 and offset information from the disassembler. 732 733 ** New function gdb.current_language that returns the name of the 734 current language. Unlike gdb.parameter('language'), this will 735 never return 'auto'. 736 737 ** New method gdb.Frame.language that returns the name of the 738 frame's language. 739 740 ** New Python API for wrapping GDB's disassembler: 741 742 - gdb.disassembler.register_disassembler(DISASSEMBLER, ARCH). 743 DISASSEMBLER is a sub-class of gdb.disassembler.Disassembler. 744 ARCH is either None or a string containing a bfd architecture 745 name. DISASSEMBLER is registered as a disassembler for 746 architecture ARCH, or for all architectures if ARCH is None. 747 The previous disassembler registered for ARCH is returned, this 748 can be None if no previous disassembler was registered. 749 750 - gdb.disassembler.Disassembler is the class from which all 751 disassemblers should inherit. Its constructor takes a string, 752 a name for the disassembler, which is currently only used in 753 some debug output. Sub-classes should override the __call__ 754 method to perform disassembly, invoking __call__ on this base 755 class will raise an exception. 756 757 - gdb.disassembler.DisassembleInfo is the class used to describe 758 a single disassembly request from GDB. An instance of this 759 class is passed to the __call__ method of 760 gdb.disassembler.Disassembler and has the following read-only 761 attributes: 'address', and 'architecture', as well as the 762 following method: 'read_memory'. 763 764 - gdb.disassembler.builtin_disassemble(INFO, MEMORY_SOURCE), 765 calls GDB's builtin disassembler on INFO, which is a 766 gdb.disassembler.DisassembleInfo object. MEMORY_SOURCE is 767 optional, its default value is None. If MEMORY_SOURCE is not 768 None then it must be an object that has a 'read_memory' method. 769 770 - gdb.disassembler.DisassemblerResult is a class that can be used 771 to wrap the result of a call to a Disassembler. It has 772 read-only attributes 'length' and 'string'. 773 774 ** gdb.Objfile now has an attribute named \\"is_file\\". This is True 775 if the objfile comes from a file, and False otherwise. 776 777 ** New function gdb.print_options that returns a dictionary of the 778 prevailing print options, in the form accepted by 779 gdb.Value.format_string. 780 781 ** gdb.Value.format_string now uses the format provided by 'print', 782 if it is called during a 'print' or other similar operation. 783 784 ** gdb.Value.format_string now accepts the 'summary' keyword. This 785 can be used to request a shorter representation of a value, the 786 way that 'set print frame-arguments scalars' does. 787 788 ** New Python type gdb.BreakpointLocation. 789 The new attribute 'locations' of gdb.Breakpoint returns a list of 790 gdb.BreakpointLocation objects specifying the locations where the 791 breakpoint is inserted into the debuggee. 792 793 ** The gdb.register_window_type method now restricts the set of 794 acceptable window names. The first character of a window's name 795 must start with a character in the set [a-zA-Z], every subsequent 796 character of a window's name must be in the set [-_.a-zA-Z0-9]. 797 798 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 799 800 ** GDBserver is now supported on LoongArch GNU/Linux. 801 802 ** GDBserver is now supported on CSKY GNU/Linux. 803 804 * LoongArch floating-point support 805 806 GDB now supports floating-point on LoongArch GNU/Linux. 807 808 * AMD GPU ROCm debugging support 809 810 GDB now supports debugging programs offloaded to AMD GPUs using the ROCm 811 platform. 812 813 *** Changes in GDB 12 814 815 * DBX mode is deprecated, and will be removed in GDB 13 816 817 * GDB 12 is the last release of GDB that will support building against 818 Python 2. From GDB 13, it will only be possible to build GDB itself 819 with Python 3 support. 820 821 * The disable-randomization setting now works on Windows. 822 823 * Improved C++ template support 824 825 GDB now treats functions/types involving C++ templates like it does function 826 overloads. Users may omit parameter lists to set breakpoints on families of 827 template functions, including types/functions composed of multiple template types: 828 829 (gdb) break template_func(template_1, int) 830 831 The above will set breakpoints at every function \`template_func' where 832 the first function parameter is any template type named \`template_1' and 833 the second function parameter is \`int'. 834 835 TAB completion also gains similar improvements. 836 837 * The FreeBSD native target now supports async mode. 838 839 * Configure changes 840 841 --enable-threading 842 843 Enable or disable multithreaded symbol loading. This is enabled 844 by default, but passing --disable-threading or --enable-threading=no 845 to configure will disable it. 846 847 Disabling this can cause a performance penalty when there are a lot of 848 symbols to load, but is useful for debugging purposes. 849 850 * New commands 851 852 maint set backtrace-on-fatal-signal on|off 853 maint show backtrace-on-fatal-signal 854 This setting is 'on' by default. When 'on' GDB will print a limited 855 backtrace to stderr in the situation where GDB terminates with a 856 fatal signal. This only supported on some platforms where the 857 backtrace and backtrace_symbols_fd functions are available. 858 859 set source open on|off 860 show source open 861 This setting, which is on by default, controls whether GDB will try 862 to open source code files. Switching this off will stop GDB trying 863 to open and read source code files, which can be useful if the files 864 are located over a slow network connection. 865 866 set varsize-limit 867 show varsize-limit 868 These are now deprecated aliases for \\"set max-value-size\\" and 869 \\"show max-value-size\\". 870 871 task apply [all | TASK-IDS...] [FLAG]... COMMAND 872 Like \\"thread apply\\", but applies COMMAND to Ada tasks. 873 874 watch [...] task ID 875 Watchpoints can now be restricted to a specific Ada task. 876 877 maint set internal-error backtrace on|off 878 maint show internal-error backtrace 879 maint set internal-warning backtrace on|off 880 maint show internal-warning backtrace 881 GDB can now print a backtrace of itself when it encounters either an 882 internal-error, or an internal-warning. This is on by default for 883 internal-error and off by default for internal-warning. 884 885 set logging on|off 886 Deprecated and replaced by \\"set logging enabled on|off\\". 887 888 set logging enabled on|off 889 show logging enabled 890 These commands set or show whether logging is enabled or disabled. 891 892 exit 893 You can now exit GDB by using the new command \\"exit\\", in addition to 894 the existing \\"quit\\" command. 895 896 set debug threads on|off 897 show debug threads 898 Print additional debug messages about thread creation and deletion. 899 900 set debug linux-nat on|off 901 show debug linux-nat 902 These new commands replaced the old 'set debug lin-lwp' and 'show 903 debug lin-lwp' respectively. Turning this setting on prints debug 904 messages relating to GDB's handling of native Linux inferiors. 905 906 maint flush source-cache 907 Flush the contents of the source code cache. 908 909 maint set gnu-source-highlight enabled on|off 910 maint show gnu-source-highlight enabled 911 Whether GDB should use the GNU Source Highlight library for adding 912 styling to source code. When off, the library will not be used, even 913 when available. When GNU Source Highlight isn't used, or can't add 914 styling to a particular source file, then the Python Pygments 915 library will be used instead. 916 917 set suppress-cli-notifications (on|off) 918 show suppress-cli-notifications 919 This controls whether printing the notifications is suppressed for CLI. 920 CLI notifications occur when you change the selected context 921 (i.e., the current inferior, thread and/or the frame), or when 922 the program being debugged stops (e.g., because of hitting a 923 breakpoint, completing source-stepping, an interrupt, etc.). 924 925 set style disassembler enabled on|off 926 show style disassembler enabled 927 If GDB is compiled with Python support, and the Python Pygments 928 package is available, then, when this setting is on, disassembler 929 output will have styling applied. 930 931 set ada source-charset 932 show ada source-charset 933 Set the character set encoding that is assumed for Ada symbols. Valid 934 values for this follow the values that can be passed to the GNAT 935 compiler via the '-gnati' option. The default is ISO-8859-1. 936 937 tui layout 938 tui focus 939 tui refresh 940 tui window height 941 These are the new names for the old 'layout', 'focus', 'refresh', 942 and 'winheight' tui commands respectively. The old names still 943 exist as aliases to these new commands. 944 945 tui window width 946 winwidth 947 The new command 'tui window width', and the alias 'winwidth' allow 948 the width of a tui window to be adjusted when windows are laid out 949 in horizontal mode. 950 951 set debug tui on|off 952 show debug tui 953 Control the display of debug output about GDB's tui. 954 955 * Changed commands 956 957 print 958 Printing of floating-point values with base-modifying formats like 959 /x has been changed to display the underlying bytes of the value in 960 the desired base. This was GDB's documented behavior, but was never 961 implemented correctly. 962 963 maint packet 964 This command can now print a reply, if the reply includes 965 non-printable characters. Any non-printable characters are printed 966 as escaped hex, e.g. x?? where '??' is replaces with the value of 967 the non-printable character. 968 969 clone-inferior 970 The clone-inferior command now ensures that the TTY, CMD and ARGS 971 settings are copied from the original inferior to the new one. 972 All modifications to the environment variables done using the 'set 973 environment' or 'unset environment' commands are also copied to the new 974 inferior. 975 976 set debug lin-lwp on|off 977 show debug lin-lwp 978 These commands have been removed from GDB. The new command 'set 979 debug linux-nat' and 'show debug linux-nat' should be used 980 instead. 981 982 info win 983 This command now includes information about the width of the tui 984 windows in its output. 985 986 layout 987 focus 988 refresh 989 winheight 990 These commands are now aliases for the 'tui layout', 'tui focus', 991 'tui refresh', and 'tui window height' commands respectively. 992 993 * GDB's Ada parser now supports an extension for specifying the exact 994 byte contents of a floating-point literal. This can be useful for 995 setting floating-point registers to a precise value without loss of 996 precision. The syntax is an extension of the based literal syntax. 997 Use, e.g., \\"16lf#0123abcd#\\" -- the number of \\"l\\"s controls the width 998 of the floating-point type, and the \\"f\\" is the marker for floating 999 point. 1000 1001 * MI changes 1002 1003 ** The '-add-inferior' with no option flags now inherits the 1004 connection of the current inferior, this restores the behaviour of 1005 GDB as it was prior to GDB 10. 1006 1007 ** The '-add-inferior' command now accepts a '--no-connection' 1008 option, which causes the new inferior to start without a 1009 connection. 1010 1011 ** The default version of the MI interpreter is now 4 (-i=mi4). 1012 1013 ** The \\"script\\" field in breakpoint output (which is syntactically 1014 incorrect in MI 3 and below) has changed in MI 4 to become a list. 1015 This affects the following commands and events: 1016 1017 - -break-insert 1018 - -break-info 1019 - =breakpoint-created 1020 - =breakpoint-modified 1021 1022 The -fix-breakpoint-script-output command can be used to enable 1023 this behavior with previous MI versions. 1024 1025 * New targets 1026 1027 GNU/Linux/LoongArch loongarch*-*-linux* 1028 1029 * Removed targets 1030 1031 S+core score-*-* 1032 1033 * Python API 1034 1035 ** New function gdb.add_history(), which takes a gdb.Value object 1036 and adds the value it represents to GDB's history list. An 1037 integer, the index of the new item in the history list, is 1038 returned. 1039 1040 ** New function gdb.history_count(), which returns the number of 1041 values in GDB's value history. 1042 1043 ** New gdb.events.gdb_exiting event. This event is called with a 1044 gdb.GdbExitingEvent object which has the read-only attribute 1045 'exit_code', which contains the value of the GDB exit code. This 1046 event is triggered once GDB decides it is going to exit, but 1047 before GDB starts to clean up its internal state. 1048 1049 ** New function gdb.architecture_names(), which returns a list 1050 containing all of the possible Architecture.name() values. Each 1051 entry is a string. 1052 1053 ** New function gdb.Architecture.integer_type(), which returns an 1054 integer type given a size and a signed-ness. 1055 1056 ** New gdb.TargetConnection object type that represents a connection 1057 (as displayed by the 'info connections' command). A sub-class, 1058 gdb.RemoteTargetConnection, is used to represent 'remote' and 1059 'extended-remote' connections. 1060 1061 ** The gdb.Inferior type now has a 'connection' property which is an 1062 instance of gdb.TargetConnection, the connection used by this 1063 inferior. This can be None if the inferior has no connection. 1064 1065 ** New 'gdb.events.connection_removed' event registry, which emits a 1066 'gdb.ConnectionEvent' when a connection is removed from GDB. 1067 This event has a 'connection' property, a gdb.TargetConnection 1068 object for the connection being removed. 1069 1070 ** New gdb.connections() function that returns a list of all 1071 currently active connections. 1072 1073 ** New gdb.RemoteTargetConnection.send_packet(PACKET) method. This 1074 is equivalent to the existing 'maint packet' CLI command; it 1075 allows a user specified packet to be sent to the remote target. 1076 1077 ** New function gdb.host_charset(), returns a string, which is the 1078 name of the current host charset. 1079 1080 ** New gdb.set_parameter(NAME, VALUE). This sets the gdb parameter 1081 NAME to VALUE. 1082 1083 ** New gdb.with_parameter(NAME, VALUE). This returns a context 1084 manager that temporarily sets the gdb parameter NAME to VALUE, 1085 then resets it when the context is exited. 1086 1087 ** The gdb.Value.format_string method now takes a 'styling' 1088 argument, which is a boolean. When true, the returned string can 1089 include escape sequences to apply styling. The styling will only 1090 be present if styling is otherwise turned on in GDB (see 'help 1091 set styling'). When false, which is the default if the argument 1092 is not given, then no styling is applied to the returned string. 1093 1094 ** New read-only attribute gdb.InferiorThread.details, which is 1095 either a string, containing additional, target specific thread 1096 state information, or None, if there is no such additional 1097 information. 1098 1099 ** New read-only attribute gdb.Type.is_scalar, which is True for 1100 scalar types, and False for all other types. 1101 1102 ** New read-only attribute gdb.Type.is_signed. This attribute 1103 should only be read when Type.is_scalar is True, and will be True 1104 for signed types, and False for all other types. Attempting to 1105 read this attribute for non-scalar types will raise a ValueError. 1106 1107 ** It is now possible to add GDB/MI commands implemented in Python. 1108 1109 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 1110 1111 ** GDBserver is now supported on OpenRISC GNU/Linux. 1112 1113 * New native configurations 1114 1115 GNU/Linux/OpenRISC or1k*-*-linux* 1116 1117 *** Changes in GDB 11 1118 1119 * The 'set disassembler-options' command now supports specifying options 1120 for the ARC target. 1121 1122 * GDB now supports general memory tagging functionality if the underlying 1123 architecture supports the proper primitives and hooks. Currently this is 1124 enabled only for AArch64 MTE. 1125 1126 This includes: 1127 1128 - Additional information when the inferior crashes with a SIGSEGV caused by 1129 a memory tag violation. 1130 1131 - A new modifier 'm' for the \\"x\\" command, which displays allocation tags for a 1132 particular memory range. 1133 1134 - Display of memory tag mismatches by \\"print\\", for addresses and 1135 pointers, if memory tagging is supported by the architecture. 1136 1137 * Building GDB now requires GMP (The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic 1138 Library). 1139 1140 * MI changes 1141 1142 ** '-break-insert --qualified' and '-dprintf-insert --qualified' 1143 1144 The MI -break-insert and -dprintf-insert commands now support a 1145 new \\"--qualified\\" option that makes GDB interpret a specified 1146 function name as a complete fully-qualified name. This is the 1147 equivalent of the CLI's \\"break -qualified\\" and \\"dprintf 1148 -qualified\\". 1149 1150 ** '-break-insert --force-condition' and '-dprintf-insert --force-condition' 1151 1152 The MI -break-insert and -dprintf-insert commands now support a 1153 '--force-condition' flag to forcibly define a condition even when 1154 the condition is invalid at all locations of the breakpoint. This 1155 is equivalent to the '-force-condition' flag of the CLI's \\"break\\" 1156 command. 1157 1158 ** '-break-condition --force' 1159 1160 The MI -break-condition command now supports a '--force' flag to 1161 forcibly define a condition even when the condition is invalid at 1162 all locations of the selected breakpoint. This is equivalent to 1163 the '-force' flag of the CLI's \\"cond\\" command. 1164 1165 ** '-file-list-exec-source-files [--group-by-objfile] 1166 [--basename | --dirname] 1167 [--] [REGEXP]' 1168 1169 The existing -file-list-exec-source-files command now takes an 1170 optional REGEXP which is used to filter the source files that are 1171 included in the results. 1172 1173 By default REGEXP is matched against the full filename of the 1174 source file. When one of --basename or --dirname is given then 1175 REGEXP is only matched against the specified part of the full 1176 source filename. 1177 1178 When the optional --group-by-objfile flag is used the output 1179 format is changed, the results are now a list of object files 1180 (executable and libraries) with the source files that are 1181 associated with each object file. 1182 1183 The results from -file-list-exec-source-files now include a 1184 'debug-fully-read' field which takes the value 'true' or 'false'. 1185 A 'true' value indicates the source file is from a compilation 1186 unit that has had its debug information fully read in by GDB, a 1187 value of 'false' indicates GDB has only performed a partial scan 1188 of the debug information so far. 1189 1190 * GDB now supports core file debugging for x86_64 Cygwin programs. 1191 1192 * GDB will now look for the .gdbinit file in a config directory before 1193 looking for ~/.gdbinit. The file is searched for in the following 1194 locations: XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdb/gdbinit, HOME/.config/gdb/gdbinit, 1195 HOME/.gdbinit. On Apple hosts the search order is instead: 1196 HOME/Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbinit, HOME/.gdbinit. 1197 1198 * GDB now supports fixed point types which are described in DWARF 1199 as base types with a fixed-point encoding. Additionally, support 1200 for the DW_AT_GNU_numerator and DW_AT_GNU_denominator has also 1201 been added. 1202 1203 For Ada, this allows support for fixed point types without requiring 1204 the use of the GNAT encoding (based on information added to the type's 1205 name following a GNAT-specific format). 1206 1207 * GDB will now load and process commands from ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit 1208 or ~/.gdbearlyinit if these files are present. These files are 1209 processed earlier than any of the other initialization files and 1210 can affect parts of GDB's startup that previously had already been 1211 completed before the initialization files were read, for example 1212 styling of the initial GDB greeting. 1213 1214 * GDB now has two new options \\"--early-init-command\\" and 1215 \\"--early-init-eval-command\\" with corresponding short options \\"-eix\\" 1216 and \\"-eiex\\" that allow options (that would normally appear in a 1217 gdbearlyinit file) to be passed on the command line. 1218 1219 * For RISC-V targets, the target feature \\"org.gnu.gdb.riscv.vector\\" is 1220 now understood by GDB, and can be used to describe the vector 1221 registers of a target. The precise requirements of this register 1222 feature are documented in the GDB manual. 1223 1224 * For ARM targets, the \\"org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile-mve\\" feature is now 1225 supported by GDB and describes a new VPR register from the ARM MVE 1226 (Helium) extension. See the GDB manual for more information. 1227 1228 * TUI improvements 1229 1230 ** TUI windows now support mouse actions. The mouse wheel scrolls 1231 the appropriate window. 1232 1233 ** Key combinations that do not have a specific action on the 1234 focused window are passed to GDB. For example, you now can use 1235 Ctrl-Left/Ctrl-Right to move between words in the command window 1236 regardless of which window is in focus. Previously you would 1237 need to focus on the command window for such key combinations to 1238 work. 1239 1240 * New commands 1241 1242 set debug event-loop 1243 show debug event-loop 1244 Control the display of debug output about GDB's event loop. 1245 1246 set print memory-tag-violations 1247 show print memory-tag-violations 1248 Control whether to display additional information about memory tag violations 1249 when printing pointers and addresses. Architecture support for memory 1250 tagging is required for this option to have an effect. 1251 1252 maintenance flush symbol-cache 1253 maintenance flush register-cache 1254 These new commands are equivalent to the already existing commands 1255 'maintenance flush-symbol-cache' and 'flushregs' respectively. 1256 1257 maintenance flush dcache 1258 A new command to flush the dcache. 1259 1260 maintenance info target-sections 1261 Print GDB's internal target sections table. 1262 1263 maintenance info jit 1264 Print the JIT code objects in the inferior known to GDB. 1265 1266 memory-tag show-logical-tag POINTER 1267 Print the logical tag for POINTER. 1268 memory-tag with-logical-tag POINTER TAG 1269 Print POINTER with logical tag TAG. 1270 memory-tag show-allocation-tag ADDRESS 1271 Print the allocation tag for ADDRESS. 1272 memory-tag set-allocation-tag ADDRESS LENGTH TAGS 1273 Set the allocation tag for [ADDRESS, ADDRESS + LENGTH) to TAGS. 1274 memory-tag check POINTER 1275 Validate that POINTER's logical tag matches the allocation tag. 1276 1277 set startup-quietly on|off 1278 show startup-quietly 1279 When 'on', this causes GDB to act as if \\"-silent\\" were passed on the 1280 command line. This command needs to be added to an early 1281 initialization file (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit) in order to 1282 affect GDB. 1283 1284 set print type hex on|off 1285 show print type hex 1286 When 'on', the 'ptype' command uses hexadecimal notation to print sizes 1287 and offsets of struct members. When 'off', decimal notation is used. 1288 1289 set python ignore-environment on|off 1290 show python ignore-environment 1291 When 'on', this causes GDB's builtin Python to ignore any 1292 environment variables that would otherwise affect how Python 1293 behaves. This command needs to be added to an early initialization 1294 file (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit) in order to affect GDB. 1295 1296 set python dont-write-bytecode auto|on|off 1297 show python dont-write-bytecode 1298 When 'on', this causes GDB's builtin Python to not write any 1299 byte-code (.pyc files) to disk. This command needs to be added to 1300 an early initialization file (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit) in 1301 order to affect GDB. When 'off' byte-code will always be written. 1302 When set to 'auto' (the default) Python will check the 1303 PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable. 1304 1305 * Changed commands 1306 1307 break [PROBE_MODIFIER] [LOCATION] [thread THREADNUM] 1308 [-force-condition] [if CONDITION] 1309 This command would previously refuse setting a breakpoint if the 1310 CONDITION expression is invalid at a location. It now accepts and 1311 defines the breakpoint if there is at least one location at which 1312 the CONDITION is valid. The locations for which the CONDITION is 1313 invalid, are automatically disabled. If CONDITION is invalid at all 1314 of the locations, setting the breakpoint is still rejected. However, 1315 the '-force-condition' flag can be used in this case for forcing GDB to 1316 define the breakpoint, making all the current locations automatically 1317 disabled. This may be useful if the user knows the condition will 1318 become meaningful at a future location, e.g. due to a shared library 1319 load. 1320 1321 condition [-force] N COND 1322 The behavior of this command is changed the same way for the 'break' 1323 command as explained above. The '-force' flag can be used to force 1324 GDB into defining the condition even when COND is invalid for all the 1325 current locations of breakpoint N. 1326 1327 flushregs 1328 maintenance flush-symbol-cache 1329 These commands are deprecated in favor of the new commands 1330 'maintenance flush register-cache' and 'maintenance flush 1331 symbol-cache' respectively. 1332 1333 set style version foreground COLOR 1334 set style version background COLOR 1335 set style version intensity VALUE 1336 Control the styling of GDB's version number text. 1337 1338 inferior [ID] 1339 When the ID parameter is omitted, then this command prints information 1340 about the current inferior. When the ID parameter is present, the 1341 behavior of the command is unchanged and have the inferior ID become 1342 the current inferior. 1343 1344 maintenance info sections 1345 The ALLOBJ keyword has been replaced with an -all-objects command 1346 line flag. It is now possible to filter which sections are printed 1347 even when -all-objects is passed. 1348 1349 ptype[/FLAGS] TYPE | EXPRESSION 1350 The 'ptype' command has two new flags. When '/x' is set, hexadecimal 1351 notation is used when printing sizes and offsets of struct members. 1352 When '/d' is set, decimal notation is used when printing sizes and 1353 offsets of struct members. Default behavior is given by 'show print 1354 type hex'. 1355 1356 info sources 1357 The info sources command output has been restructured. The results 1358 are now based around a list of objfiles (executable and libraries), 1359 and for each objfile the source files that are part of that objfile 1360 are listed. 1361 1362 * Removed targets and native configurations 1363 1364 ARM Symbian arm*-*-symbianelf* 1365 1366 * New remote packets 1367 1368 qMemTags 1369 Request the remote to send allocation tags for a particular memory range. 1370 QMemTags 1371 Request the remote to store the specified allocation tags to the requested 1372 memory range. 1373 1374 * Guile API 1375 1376 ** Improved support for rvalue reference values: 1377 TYPE_CODE_RVALUE_REF is now exported as part of the API and the 1378 value-referenced-value procedure now handles rvalue reference 1379 values. 1380 1381 ** New procedures for obtaining value variants: 1382 value-reference-value, value-rvalue-reference-value and 1383 value-const-value. 1384 1385 ** Temporary breakpoints can now be created with make-breakpoint and 1386 tested for using breakpoint-temporary?. 1387 1388 * Python API 1389 1390 ** Inferior objects now contain a read-only 'connection_num' attribute that 1391 gives the connection number as seen in 'info connections' and 1392 'info inferiors'. 1393 1394 ** New method gdb.Frame.level() which returns the stack level of the 1395 frame object. 1396 1397 ** New method gdb.PendingFrame.level() which returns the stack level 1398 of the frame object. 1399 1400 ** When hitting a catchpoint, the Python API will now emit a 1401 gdb.BreakpointEvent rather than a gdb.StopEvent. The 1402 gdb.Breakpoint attached to the event will have type BP_CATCHPOINT. 1403 1404 ** Python TUI windows can now receive mouse click events. If the 1405 Window object implements the click method, it is called for each 1406 mouse click event in this window. 1407 1408 *** Changes in GDB 10 1409 1410 * There are new feature names for ARC targets: \\"org.gnu.gdb.arc.core\\" 1411 and \\"org.gnu.gdb.arc.aux\\". The old names are still supported but 1412 must be considered obsolete. They will be deprecated after some 1413 grace period. 1414 1415 * Help and apropos commands will now show the documentation of a 1416 command only once, even if that command has one or more aliases. 1417 These commands now show the command name, then all of its aliases, 1418 and finally the description of the command. 1419 1420 * 'help aliases' now shows only the user defined aliases. GDB predefined 1421 aliases are shown together with their aliased command. 1422 1423 * GDB now supports debuginfod, an HTTP server for distributing ELF/DWARF 1424 debugging information as well as source code. 1425 1426 When built with debuginfod, GDB can automatically query debuginfod 1427 servers for the separate debug files and source code of the executable 1428 being debugged. 1429 1430 To build GDB with debuginfod, pass --with-debuginfod to configure (this 1431 requires libdebuginfod, the debuginfod client library). 1432 1433 debuginfod is distributed with elfutils, starting with version 0.178. 1434 1435 You can get the latest version from https://sourceware.org/elfutils. 1436 1437 * Multi-target debugging support 1438 1439 GDB now supports debugging multiple target connections 1440 simultaneously. For example, you can now have each inferior 1441 connected to different remote servers running in different machines, 1442 or have one inferior debugging a local native process, an inferior 1443 debugging a core dump, etc. 1444 1445 This support is experimental and comes with some limitations -- you 1446 can only resume multiple targets simultaneously if all targets 1447 support non-stop mode, and all remote stubs or servers must support 1448 the same set of remote protocol features exactly. See also \\"info 1449 connections\\" and \\"add-inferior -no-connection\\" below, and \\"maint set 1450 target-non-stop\\" in the user manual. 1451 1452 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 1453 1454 ** GDBserver is now supported on ARC GNU/Linux. 1455 1456 ** GDBserver is now supported on RISC-V GNU/Linux. 1457 1458 ** GDBserver no longer supports these host triplets: 1459 1460 i[34567]86-*-lynxos* 1461 powerpc-*-lynxos* 1462 i[34567]86-*-nto* 1463 bfin-*-*linux* 1464 crisv32-*-linux* 1465 cris-*-linux* 1466 m32r*-*-linux* 1467 tilegx-*-linux* 1468 arm*-*-mingw32ce* 1469 i[34567]86-*-mingw32ce* 1470 1471 * Debugging MS-Windows processes now sets _exitsignal when the 1472 inferior is terminated by a signal, instead of setting _exitcode. 1473 1474 * Multithreaded symbol loading has now been enabled by default on systems 1475 that support it (see entry for GDB 9, below), providing faster 1476 performance for programs with many symbols. 1477 1478 * The _siginfo convenience variable now also works on Windows targets, 1479 and will display the EXCEPTION_RECORD of the last handled exception. 1480 1481 * TUI windows can now be arranged horizontally. 1482 1483 * The command history filename can now be set to the empty string 1484 either using 'set history filename' or by setting 'GDBHISTFILE=' in 1485 the environment. The effect of setting this filename to the empty 1486 string is that GDB will not try to load any previous command 1487 history. 1488 1489 * On Windows targets, it is now possible to debug 32-bit programs with a 1490 64-bit GDB. 1491 1492 * New commands 1493 1494 set exec-file-mismatch -- Set exec-file-mismatch handling (ask|warn|off). 1495 show exec-file-mismatch -- Show exec-file-mismatch handling (ask|warn|off). 1496 Set or show the option 'exec-file-mismatch'. When GDB attaches to a 1497 running process, this new option indicates whether to detect 1498 a mismatch between the current executable file loaded by GDB and the 1499 executable file used to start the process. If 'ask', the default, 1500 display a warning and ask the user whether to load the process 1501 executable file; if 'warn', just display a warning; if 'off', don't 1502 attempt to detect a mismatch. 1503 1504 tui new-layout NAME WINDOW WEIGHT [WINDOW WEIGHT]... 1505 Define a new TUI layout, specifying its name and the windows that 1506 will be displayed. 1507 1508 maintenance print xml-tdesc [FILE] 1509 Prints the current target description as an XML document. If the 1510 optional FILE is provided (which is an XML target description) then 1511 the target description is read from FILE into GDB, and then 1512 reprinted. 1513 1514 maintenance print core-file-backed-mappings 1515 Prints file-backed mappings loaded from a core file's note section. 1516 Output is expected to be similar to that of \\"info proc mappings\\". 1517 1518 set debug fortran-array-slicing on|off 1519 show debug fortran-array-slicing 1520 Print debugging when taking slices of Fortran arrays. 1521 1522 set fortran repack-array-slices on|off 1523 show fortran repack-array-slices 1524 When taking slices from Fortran arrays and strings, if the slice is 1525 non-contiguous within the original value then, when this option is 1526 on, the new value will be repacked into a single contiguous value. 1527 When this option is off, then the value returned will consist of a 1528 descriptor that describes the slice within the memory of the 1529 original parent value. 1530 1531 * Changed commands 1532 1533 alias [-a] [--] ALIAS = COMMAND [DEFAULT-ARGS...] 1534 The alias command can now specify default args for an alias. 1535 GDB automatically prepends the alias default args to the argument list 1536 provided explicitly by the user. 1537 For example, to have a backtrace with full details, you can define 1538 an alias 'bt_ALL' as 1539 'alias bt_ALL = backtrace -entry-values both -frame-arg all 1540 -past-main -past-entry -full'. 1541 Alias default arguments can also use a set of nested 'with' commands, 1542 e.g. 'alias pp10 = with print pretty -- with print elem 10 -- print' 1543 defines the alias pp10 that will pretty print a maximum of 10 elements 1544 of the given expression (if the expression is an array). 1545 1546 * New targets 1547 1548 GNU/Linux/RISC-V (gdbserver) riscv*-*-linux* 1549 BPF bpf-unknown-none 1550 Z80 z80-unknown-* 1551 1552 * Python API 1553 1554 ** gdb.register_window_type can be used to implement new TUI windows 1555 in Python. 1556 1557 ** Dynamic types can now be queried. gdb.Type has a new attribute, 1558 \\"dynamic\\", and gdb.Type.sizeof can be None for a dynamic type. A 1559 field of a dynamic type may have None for its \\"bitpos\\" attribute 1560 as well. 1561 1562 ** Commands written in Python can be in the \\"TUI\\" help class by 1563 registering with the new constant gdb.COMMAND_TUI. 1564 1565 ** New method gdb.PendingFrame.architecture () to retrieve the 1566 architecture of the pending frame. 1567 1568 ** New gdb.Architecture.registers method that returns a 1569 gdb.RegisterDescriptorIterator object, an iterator that returns 1570 gdb.RegisterDescriptor objects. The new RegisterDescriptor is a 1571 way to query the registers available for an architecture. 1572 1573 ** New gdb.Architecture.register_groups method that returns a 1574 gdb.RegisterGroupIterator object, an iterator that returns 1575 gdb.RegisterGroup objects. The new RegisterGroup is a way to 1576 discover the available register groups. 1577 1578 * Guile API 1579 1580 ** GDB can now be built with GNU Guile 3.0 and 2.2 in addition to 2.0. 1581 1582 ** Procedures 'memory-port-read-buffer-size', 1583 'set-memory-port-read-buffer-size!', 'memory-port-write-buffer-size', 1584 and 'set-memory-port-write-buffer-size!' are deprecated. When 1585 using Guile 2.2 and later, users who need to control the size of 1586 a memory port's internal buffer can use the 'setvbuf' procedure. 1587 1588 *** Changes in GDB 9 1589 1590 * 'thread-exited' event is now available in the annotations interface. 1591 1592 * New built-in convenience variables _gdb_major and _gdb_minor 1593 provide the GDB version. They are handy for conditionally using 1594 features available only in or since specific GDB versions, in 1595 scripts that should work error-free with many different versions, 1596 such as in system-wide init files. 1597 1598 * New built-in convenience functions _gdb_setting, _gdb_setting_str, 1599 _gdb_maint_setting and _gdb_maint_setting_str provide access to values 1600 of the GDB settings and the GDB maintenance settings. They are handy 1601 for changing the logic of user defined commands depending on the 1602 current GDB settings. 1603 1604 * GDB now supports Thread Local Storage (TLS) variables on several 1605 FreeBSD architectures (amd64, i386, powerpc, riscv). Other 1606 architectures require kernel changes. TLS is not yet supported for 1607 amd64 and i386 process core dumps. 1608 1609 * Support for Pointer Authentication (PAC) on AArch64 Linux. Return 1610 addresses that required unmasking are shown in the backtrace with the 1611 postfix [PAC]. 1612 1613 * Two new convenience functions _cimag and _creal that extract the 1614 imaginary and real parts respectively from complex numbers. 1615 1616 * New built-in convenience variables _shell_exitcode and _shell_exitsignal 1617 provide the exitcode or exit status of the shell commands launched by 1618 GDB commands such as \\"shell\\", \\"pipe\\" and \\"make\\". 1619 1620 * The command define-prefix can now define user defined prefix commands. 1621 User defined commands can now be defined using these user defined prefix 1622 commands. 1623 1624 * Command names can now use the . character. 1625 1626 * The RX port now supports XML target descriptions. 1627 1628 * GDB now shows the Ada task names at more places, e.g. in task switching 1629 messages. 1630 1631 * GDB can now be compiled with Python 3 on Windows. 1632 1633 * New convenience variable _ada_exception holds the address of the 1634 Ada exception being thrown. This is set by Ada-related catchpoints. 1635 1636 * GDB can now place breakpoints on nested functions and subroutines in 1637 Fortran code. The '::' operator can be used between parent and 1638 child scopes when placing breakpoints, for example: 1639 1640 (gdb) break outer_function::inner_function 1641 1642 The 'outer_function::' prefix is only needed if 'inner_function' is 1643 not visible in the current scope. 1644 1645 * In addition to the system-wide gdbinit file, if configured with 1646 --with-system-gdbinit-dir, GDB will now also load files in that directory 1647 as system gdbinit files, unless the -nx or -n flag is provided. Files 1648 with extensions .gdb, .py and .scm are supported as long as GDB was 1649 compiled with support for that language. 1650 1651 * GDB now supports multithreaded symbol loading for higher performance. 1652 This feature is still in testing, so it is disabled by default. You 1653 can turn it on using 'maint set worker-threads unlimited'. 1654 1655 * Python API 1656 1657 ** The gdb.Value type has a new method 'format_string' which returns a 1658 string representing the value. The formatting is controlled by the 1659 optional keyword arguments: 'raw', 'pretty_arrays', 'pretty_structs', 1660 'array_indexes', 'symbols', 'unions', 'deref_refs', 'actual_objects', 1661 'static_members', 'max_elements', 'repeat_threshold', and 'format'. 1662 1663 ** gdb.Type has a new property 'objfile' which returns the objfile the 1664 type was defined in. 1665 1666 ** The frame information printed by the python frame filtering code 1667 is now consistent with what the 'backtrace' command prints when 1668 there are no filters, or when the 'backtrace' '-no-filters' option 1669 is given. 1670 1671 ** The new function gdb.lookup_static_symbol can be used to look up 1672 symbols with static linkage. 1673 1674 ** The new function gdb.lookup_static_symbols can be used to look up 1675 all static symbols with static linkage. 1676 1677 ** gdb.Objfile has new methods 'lookup_global_symbol' and 1678 'lookup_static_symbol' to lookup a symbol from this objfile only. 1679 1680 ** gdb.Block now supports the dictionary syntax for accessing symbols in 1681 this block (e.g. block['local_variable']). 1682 1683 * New commands 1684 1685 | [COMMAND] | SHELL_COMMAND 1686 | -d DELIM COMMAND DELIM SHELL_COMMAND 1687 pipe [COMMAND] | SHELL_COMMAND 1688 pipe -d DELIM COMMAND DELIM SHELL_COMMAND 1689 Executes COMMAND and sends its output to SHELL_COMMAND. 1690 With no COMMAND, repeat the last executed command 1691 and send its output to SHELL_COMMAND. 1692 1693 define-prefix COMMAND 1694 Define or mark a command as a user-defined prefix command. 1695 1696 with SETTING [VALUE] [-- COMMAND] 1697 w SETTING [VALUE] [-- COMMAND] 1698 Temporarily set SETTING, run COMMAND, and restore SETTING. 1699 Usage: with SETTING -- COMMAND 1700 With no COMMAND, repeats the last executed command. 1701 SETTING is any GDB setting you can change with the \\"set\\" 1702 subcommands. For example, 'with language c -- print someobj' 1703 temporarily switches to the C language in order to print someobj. 1704 Settings can be combined: 'w lang c -- w print elements unlimited -- 1705 usercmd' switches to the C language and runs usercmd with no limit 1706 of array elements to print. 1707 1708 maint with SETTING [VALUE] [-- COMMAND] 1709 Like \\"with\\", but works with \\"maintenance set\\" settings. 1710 1711 set may-call-functions [on|off] 1712 show may-call-functions 1713 This controls whether GDB will attempt to call functions in 1714 the program, such as with expressions in the print command. It 1715 defaults to on. Calling functions in the program being debugged 1716 can have undesired side effects. It is now possible to forbid 1717 such function calls. If function calls are forbidden, GDB will throw 1718 an error when a command (such as print expression) calls a function 1719 in the program. 1720 1721 set print finish [on|off] 1722 show print finish 1723 This controls whether the \`finish' command will display the value 1724 that is returned by the current function. When \`off', the value is 1725 still entered into the value history, but it is not printed. The 1726 default is \`on'. 1727 1728 set print max-depth 1729 show print max-depth 1730 Allows deeply nested structures to be simplified when printing by 1731 replacing deeply nested parts (beyond the max-depth) with ellipses. 1732 The default max-depth is 20, but this can be set to unlimited to get 1733 the old behavior back. 1734 1735 set print raw-values [on|off] 1736 show print raw-values 1737 By default, GDB applies the enabled pretty printers when printing a 1738 value. This allows to ignore the enabled pretty printers for a series 1739 of commands. The default is 'off'. 1740 1741 set logging debugredirect [on|off] 1742 By default, GDB debug output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. 1743 Set if you want debug output to go only to the log file. 1744 1745 set style title foreground COLOR 1746 set style title background COLOR 1747 set style title intensity VALUE 1748 Control the styling of titles. 1749 1750 set style highlight foreground COLOR 1751 set style highlight background COLOR 1752 set style highlight intensity VALUE 1753 Control the styling of highlightings. 1754 1755 maint set worker-threads 1756 maint show worker-threads 1757 Control the number of worker threads that can be used by GDB. The 1758 default is 0. \\"unlimited\\" lets GDB choose a number that is 1759 reasonable. Currently worker threads are only used when demangling 1760 the names of linker symbols. 1761 1762 set style tui-border foreground COLOR 1763 set style tui-border background COLOR 1764 Control the styling of TUI borders. 1765 1766 set style tui-active-border foreground COLOR 1767 set style tui-active-border background COLOR 1768 Control the styling of the active TUI border. 1769 1770 maint set test-settings KIND 1771 maint show test-settings KIND 1772 A set of commands used by the testsuite for exercising the settings 1773 infrastructure. 1774 1775 maint set tui-resize-message [on|off] 1776 maint show tui-resize-message 1777 Control whether GDB prints a message each time the terminal is 1778 resized when in TUI mode. This is primarily useful for testing the 1779 TUI. 1780 1781 set print frame-info [short-location|location|location-and-address 1782 |source-and-location|source-line|auto] 1783 show print frame-info 1784 This controls what frame information is printed by the commands printing 1785 a frame. This setting will e.g. influence the behaviour of 'backtrace', 1786 'frame', 'stepi'. The python frame filtering also respect this setting. 1787 The 'backtrace' '-frame-info' option can override this global setting. 1788 1789 set tui compact-source 1790 show tui compact-source 1791 1792 Enable the \\"compact\\" display mode for the TUI source window. The 1793 compact display uses only as much space as is needed for the line 1794 numbers in the current file, and only a single space to separate the 1795 line numbers from the source. 1796 1797 info modules [-q] [REGEXP] 1798 Return a list of Fortran modules matching REGEXP, or all modules if 1799 no REGEXP is given. 1800 1801 info module functions [-q] [-m MODULE_REGEXP] [-t TYPE_REGEXP] [REGEXP] 1802 Return a list of functions within all modules, grouped by module. 1803 The list of functions can be restricted with the optional regular 1804 expressions. MODULE_REGEXP matches against the module name, 1805 TYPE_REGEXP matches against the function type signature, and REGEXP 1806 matches against the function name. 1807 1808 info module variables [-q] [-m MODULE_REGEXP] [-t TYPE_REGEXP] [REGEXP] 1809 Return a list of variables within all modules, grouped by module. 1810 The list of variables can be restricted with the optional regular 1811 expressions. MODULE_REGEXP matches against the module name, 1812 TYPE_REGEXP matches against the variable type, and REGEXP matches 1813 against the variable name. 1814 1815 set debug remote-packet-max-chars 1816 show debug remote-packet-max-chars 1817 Controls the number of characters to output in a remote packet when using 1818 \\"set debug remote\\". 1819 The default is 512 bytes. 1820 1821 info connections 1822 Lists the target connections currently in use. 1823 1824 * Changed commands 1825 1826 help 1827 The \\"help\\" command uses the title style to enhance the 1828 readibility of its output by styling the classes and 1829 command names. 1830 1831 apropos [-v] REGEXP 1832 Similarly to \\"help\\", the \\"apropos\\" command also uses the 1833 title style for the command names. \\"apropos\\" accepts now 1834 a flag \\"-v\\" (verbose) to show the full documentation 1835 of matching commands and to use the highlight style to mark 1836 the documentation parts matching REGEXP. 1837 1838 printf 1839 eval 1840 The GDB printf and eval commands can now print C-style and Ada-style 1841 string convenience variables without calling functions in the program. 1842 This allows to do formatted printing of strings without having 1843 a running inferior, or when debugging a core dump. 1844 1845 info sources [-dirname | -basename] [--] [REGEXP] 1846 This command has now optional arguments to only print the files 1847 whose names match REGEXP. The arguments -dirname and -basename 1848 allow to restrict matching respectively to the dirname and basename 1849 parts of the files. 1850 1851 show style 1852 The \\"show style\\" and its subcommands are now styling 1853 a style name in their output using its own style, to help 1854 the user visualize the different styles. 1855 1856 set print frame-arguments 1857 The new value 'presence' indicates to only indicate the presence of 1858 arguments using ..., instead of printing argument names and values. 1859 1860 set print raw-frame-arguments 1861 show print raw-frame-arguments 1862 1863 These commands replace the similarly-named \\"set/show print raw 1864 frame-arguments\\" commands (now with a dash instead of a space). The 1865 old commands are now deprecated and may be removed in a future 1866 release. 1867 1868 add-inferior [-no-connection] 1869 The add-inferior command now supports a \\"-no-connection\\" flag that 1870 makes the new inferior start with no target connection associated. 1871 By default, the new inferior inherits the target connection of the 1872 current inferior. See also \\"info connections\\". 1873 1874 info inferior 1875 This command's output now includes a new \\"Connection\\" column 1876 indicating which target connection an inferior is bound to. See 1877 \\"info connections\\" above. 1878 1879 maint test-options require-delimiter 1880 maint test-options unknown-is-error 1881 maint test-options unknown-is-operand 1882 maint show test-options-completion-result 1883 Commands used by the testsuite to validate the command options 1884 framework. 1885 1886 focus, winheight, +, -, >, < 1887 These commands are now case-sensitive. 1888 1889 * New command options, command completion 1890 1891 GDB now has a standard infrastructure to support dash-style command 1892 options ('-OPT'). One benefit is that commands that use it can 1893 easily support completion of command line arguments. Try \\"CMD 1894 -[TAB]\\" or \\"help CMD\\" to find options supported by a command. Over 1895 time, we intend to migrate most commands to this infrastructure. A 1896 number of commands got support for new command options in this 1897 release: 1898 1899 ** The \\"print\\" and \\"compile print\\" commands now support a number of 1900 options that allow overriding relevant global print settings as 1901 set by \\"set print\\" subcommands: 1902 1903 -address [on|off] 1904 -array [on|off] 1905 -array-indexes [on|off] 1906 -elements NUMBER|unlimited 1907 -null-stop [on|off] 1908 -object [on|off] 1909 -pretty [on|off] 1910 -raw-values [on|off] 1911 -repeats NUMBER|unlimited 1912 -static-members [on|off] 1913 -symbol [on|off] 1914 -union [on|off] 1915 -vtbl [on|off] 1916 1917 Note that because the \\"print\\"/\\"compile print\\" commands accept 1918 arbitrary expressions which may look like options (including 1919 abbreviations), if you specify any command option, then you must 1920 use a double dash (\\"--\\") to mark the end of argument processing. 1921 1922 ** The \\"backtrace\\" command now supports a number of options that 1923 allow overriding relevant global print settings as set by \\"set 1924 backtrace\\" and \\"set print\\" subcommands: 1925 1926 -entry-values no|only|preferred|if-needed|both|compact|default 1927 -frame-arguments all|scalars|none 1928 -raw-frame-arguments [on|off] 1929 -frame-info auto|source-line|location|source-and-location 1930 |location-and-address|short-location 1931 -past-main [on|off] 1932 -past-entry [on|off] 1933 1934 In addition, the full/no-filters/hide qualifiers are now also 1935 exposed as command options too: 1936 1937 -full 1938 -no-filters 1939 -hide 1940 1941 ** The \\"frame apply\\", \\"tfaas\\" and \\"faas\\" commands similarly now 1942 support the following options: 1943 1944 -past-main [on|off] 1945 -past-entry [on|off] 1946 1947 ** The new \\"info sources\\" options -dirname and -basename options 1948 are using the standard '-OPT' infrastructure. 1949 1950 All options above can also be abbreviated. The argument of boolean 1951 (on/off) options can be 0/1 too, and also the argument is assumed 1952 \\"on\\" if omitted. This allows writing compact command invocations, 1953 like for example: 1954 1955 (gdb) p -ra -p -o 0 -- *myptr 1956 1957 The above is equivalent to: 1958 1959 (gdb) print -raw-values -pretty -object off -- *myptr 1960 1961 ** The \\"info types\\" command now supports the '-q' flag to disable 1962 printing of some header information in a similar fashion to \\"info 1963 variables\\" and \\"info functions\\". 1964 1965 ** The \\"info variables\\", \\"info functions\\", and \\"whereis\\" commands 1966 now take a '-n' flag that excludes non-debug symbols (symbols 1967 from the symbol table, not from the debug info such as DWARF) 1968 from the results. 1969 1970 * Completion improvements 1971 1972 ** GDB can now complete the options of the \\"thread apply all\\" and 1973 \\"taas\\" commands, and their \\"-ascending\\" option can now be 1974 abbreviated. 1975 1976 ** GDB can now complete the options of the \\"info threads\\", \\"info 1977 functions\\", \\"info variables\\", \\"info locals\\", and \\"info args\\" 1978 commands. 1979 1980 ** GDB can now complete the options of the \\"compile file\\" and 1981 \\"compile code\\" commands. The \\"compile file\\" command now 1982 completes on filenames. 1983 1984 ** GDB can now complete the backtrace command's 1985 \\"full/no-filters/hide\\" qualifiers. 1986 1987 * In settings, you can now abbreviate \\"unlimited\\". 1988 1989 E.g., \\"set print elements u\\" is now equivalent to \\"set print 1990 elements unlimited\\". 1991 1992 * New MI commands 1993 1994 -complete 1995 This lists all the possible completions for the rest of the line, if it 1996 were to be given as a command itself. This is intended for use by MI 1997 frontends in cases when separate CLI and MI channels cannot be used. 1998 1999 -catch-throw, -catch-rethrow, and -catch-catch 2000 These can be used to catch C++ exceptions in a similar fashion to 2001 the CLI commands 'catch throw', 'catch rethrow', and 'catch catch'. 2002 2003 -symbol-info-functions, -symbol-info-types, and -symbol-info-variables 2004 These commands are the MI equivalent of the CLI commands 'info 2005 functions', 'info types', and 'info variables' respectively. 2006 2007 -symbol-info-modules, this is the MI equivalent of the CLI 'info 2008 modules' command. 2009 2010 -symbol-info-module-functions and -symbol-info-module-variables. 2011 These commands are the MI equivalent of the CLI commands 'info 2012 module functions' and 'info module variables'. 2013 2014 * Other MI changes 2015 2016 ** The default version of the MI interpreter is now 3 (-i=mi3). 2017 2018 ** The output of information about multi-location breakpoints (which is 2019 syntactically incorrect in MI 2) has changed in MI 3. This affects 2020 the following commands and events: 2021 2022 - -break-insert 2023 - -break-info 2024 - =breakpoint-created 2025 - =breakpoint-modified 2026 2027 The -fix-multi-location-breakpoint-output command can be used to enable 2028 this behavior with previous MI versions. 2029 2030 ** Backtraces and frames include a new optional field addr_flags which is 2031 given after the addr field. On AArch64 this contains PAC if the address 2032 has been masked in the frame. On all other targets the field is not 2033 present. 2034 2035 * Testsuite 2036 2037 The testsuite now creates the files gdb.cmd (containing the arguments 2038 used to launch GDB) and gdb.in (containing all the commands sent to 2039 GDB) in the output directory for each test script. Multiple invocations 2040 are appended with .1, .2, .3 etc. 2041 2042 * Building GDB and GDBserver now requires GNU make >= 3.82. 2043 2044 Using another implementation of the make program or an earlier version of 2045 GNU make to build GDB or GDBserver is not supported. 2046 2047 * Building GDB now requires GNU readline >= 7.0. 2048 2049 GDB now bundles GNU readline 8.0, but if you choose to use 2050 --with-system-readline, only readline >= 7.0 can be used. 2051 2052 * The TUI SingleKey keymap is now named \\"SingleKey\\". This can be used 2053 from .inputrc to bind keys in this keymap. This feature is only 2054 available when gdb is built against GNU readline 8.0 or later. 2055 2056 * Removed targets and native configurations 2057 2058 GDB no longer supports debugging the Cell Broadband Engine. This includes 2059 both debugging standalone Cell/B.E. SPU applications and integrated debugging 2060 of Cell/B.E. applications that use both the PPU and SPU architectures. 2061 2062 * New Simulators 2063 2064 TI PRU pru-*-elf 2065 2066 * Removed targets and native configurations 2067 2068 Solaris 10 i?86-*-solaris2.10, x86_64-*-solaris2.10, 2069 sparc*-*-solaris2.10 2070 2071 *** Changes in GDB 8.3 2072 2073 * GDB and GDBserver now support access to additional registers on 2074 PowerPC GNU/Linux targets: PPR, DSCR, TAR, EBB/PMU registers, and 2075 HTM registers. 2076 2077 * GDB now has experimental support for the compilation and injection of 2078 C++ source code into the inferior. This beta release does not include 2079 support for several language features, such as templates, constructors, 2080 and operators. 2081 2082 This feature requires GCC 7.1 or higher built with libcp1.so 2083 (the C++ plug-in). 2084 2085 * GDB and GDBserver now support IPv6 connections. IPv6 addresses 2086 can be passed using the '[ADDRESS]:PORT' notation, or the regular 2087 'ADDRESS:PORT' method. 2088 2089 * DWARF index cache: GDB can now automatically save indices of DWARF 2090 symbols on disk to speed up further loading of the same binaries. 2091 2092 * Ada task switching is now supported on aarch64-elf targets when 2093 debugging a program using the Ravenscar Profile. For more information, 2094 see the \\"Tasking Support when using the Ravenscar Profile\\" section 2095 in the GDB user manual. 2096 2097 * GDB in batch mode now exits with status 1 if the last command to be 2098 executed failed. 2099 2100 * The RISC-V target now supports target descriptions. 2101 2102 * System call catchpoints now support system call aliases on FreeBSD. 2103 When the ABI of a system call changes in FreeBSD, this is 2104 implemented by leaving a compatibility system call using the old ABI 2105 at the existing number and allocating a new system call number for 2106 the new ABI. For example, FreeBSD 12 altered the layout of 'struct 2107 kevent' used by the 'kevent' system call. As a result, FreeBSD 12 2108 kernels ship with both 'kevent' and 'freebsd11_kevent' system calls. 2109 The 'freebsd11_kevent' system call is assigned an alias of 'kevent' 2110 so that a system call catchpoint for the 'kevent' system call will 2111 catch invocations of both the 'kevent' and 'freebsd11_kevent' 2112 binaries. This ensures that 'kevent' system calls are caught for 2113 binaries using either the old or new ABIs. 2114 2115 * Terminal styling is now available for the CLI and the TUI. GNU 2116 Source Highlight can additionally be used to provide styling of 2117 source code snippets. See the \\"set style\\" commands, below, for more 2118 information. 2119 2120 * Removed support for old demangling styles arm, edg, gnu, hp and 2121 lucid. 2122 2123 * New commands 2124 2125 set debug compile-cplus-types 2126 show debug compile-cplus-types 2127 Control the display of debug output about type conversion in the 2128 C++ compile feature. Commands have no effect while compiling 2129 for other languages. 2130 2131 set debug skip 2132 show debug skip 2133 Control whether debug output about files/functions skipping is 2134 displayed. 2135 2136 frame apply [all | COUNT | -COUNT | level LEVEL...] [FLAG]... COMMAND 2137 Apply a command to some frames. 2138 FLAG arguments allow to control what output to produce and how to handle 2139 errors raised when applying COMMAND to a frame. 2140 2141 taas COMMAND 2142 Apply a command to all threads (ignoring errors and empty output). 2143 Shortcut for 'thread apply all -s COMMAND'. 2144 2145 faas COMMAND 2146 Apply a command to all frames (ignoring errors and empty output). 2147 Shortcut for 'frame apply all -s COMMAND'. 2148 2149 tfaas COMMAND 2150 Apply a command to all frames of all threads (ignoring errors and empty 2151 output). 2152 Shortcut for 'thread apply all -s frame apply all -s COMMAND'. 2153 2154 maint set dwarf unwinders (on|off) 2155 maint show dwarf unwinders 2156 Control whether DWARF unwinders can be used. 2157 2158 info proc files 2159 Display a list of open files for a process. 2160 2161 * Changed commands 2162 2163 Changes to the \\"frame\\", \\"select-frame\\", and \\"info frame\\" CLI commands. 2164 These commands all now take a frame specification which 2165 is either a frame level, or one of the keywords 'level', 'address', 2166 'function', or 'view' followed by a parameter. Selecting a frame by 2167 address, or viewing a frame outside the current backtrace now 2168 requires the use of a keyword. Selecting a frame by level is 2169 unchanged. The MI comment \\"-stack-select-frame\\" is unchanged. 2170 2171 target remote FILENAME 2172 target extended-remote FILENAME 2173 If FILENAME is a Unix domain socket, GDB will attempt to connect 2174 to this socket instead of opening FILENAME as a character device. 2175 2176 info args [-q] [-t TYPEREGEXP] [NAMEREGEXP] 2177 info functions [-q] [-t TYPEREGEXP] [NAMEREGEXP] 2178 info locals [-q] [-t TYPEREGEXP] [NAMEREGEXP] 2179 info variables [-q] [-t TYPEREGEXP] [NAMEREGEXP] 2180 These commands can now print only the searched entities 2181 matching the provided regexp(s), giving a condition 2182 on the entity names or entity types. The flag -q disables 2183 printing headers or informations messages. 2184 2185 info functions 2186 info types 2187 info variables 2188 rbreak 2189 These commands now determine the syntax for the shown entities 2190 according to the language chosen by \`set language'. In particular, 2191 \`set language auto' means to automatically choose the language of 2192 the shown entities. 2193 2194 thread apply [all | COUNT | -COUNT] [FLAG]... COMMAND 2195 The 'thread apply' command accepts new FLAG arguments. 2196 FLAG arguments allow to control what output to produce and how to handle 2197 errors raised when applying COMMAND to a thread. 2198 2199 set tui tab-width NCHARS 2200 show tui tab-width NCHARS 2201 \\"set tui tab-width\\" replaces the \\"tabset\\" command, which has been deprecated. 2202 2203 set style enabled [on|off] 2204 show style enabled 2205 Enable or disable terminal styling. Styling is enabled by default 2206 on most hosts, but disabled by default when in batch mode. 2207 2208 set style sources [on|off] 2209 show style sources 2210 Enable or disable source code styling. Source code styling is 2211 enabled by default, but only takes effect if styling in general is 2212 enabled, and if GDB was linked with GNU Source Highlight. 2213 2214 set style filename foreground COLOR 2215 set style filename background COLOR 2216 set style filename intensity VALUE 2217 Control the styling of file names. 2218 2219 set style function foreground COLOR 2220 set style function background COLOR 2221 set style function intensity VALUE 2222 Control the styling of function names. 2223 2224 set style variable foreground COLOR 2225 set style variable background COLOR 2226 set style variable intensity VALUE 2227 Control the styling of variable names. 2228 2229 set style address foreground COLOR 2230 set style address background COLOR 2231 set style address intensity VALUE 2232 Control the styling of addresses. 2233 2234 * MI changes 2235 2236 ** The '-data-disassemble' MI command now accepts an '-a' option to 2237 disassemble the whole function surrounding the given program 2238 counter value or function name. Support for this feature can be 2239 verified by using the \\"-list-features\\" command, which should 2240 contain \\"data-disassemble-a-option\\". 2241 2242 ** Command responses and notifications that include a frame now include 2243 the frame's architecture in a new \\"arch\\" attribute. 2244 2245 * New native configurations 2246 2247 GNU/Linux/RISC-V riscv*-*-linux* 2248 FreeBSD/riscv riscv*-*-freebsd* 2249 2250 * New targets 2251 2252 GNU/Linux/RISC-V riscv*-*-linux* 2253 CSKY ELF csky*-*-elf 2254 CSKY GNU/LINUX csky*-*-linux 2255 FreeBSD/riscv riscv*-*-freebsd* 2256 NXP S12Z s12z-*-elf 2257 GNU/Linux/OpenRISC or1k*-*-linux* 2258 2259 * Removed targets 2260 2261 GDB no longer supports native debugging on versions of MS-Windows 2262 before Windows XP. 2263 2264 * Python API 2265 2266 ** GDB no longer supports Python versions less than 2.6. 2267 2268 ** The gdb.Inferior type has a new 'progspace' property, which is the program 2269 space associated to that inferior. 2270 2271 ** The gdb.Progspace type has a new 'objfiles' method, which returns the list 2272 of objfiles associated to that program space. 2273 2274 ** gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_COMMON_BLOCK, gdb.SYMBOL_MODULE_DOMAIN, and 2275 gdb.SYMBOL_COMMON_BLOCK_DOMAIN were added to reflect changes to 2276 the gdb core. 2277 2278 ** gdb.SYMBOL_VARIABLES_DOMAIN, gdb.SYMBOL_FUNCTIONS_DOMAIN, and 2279 gdb.SYMBOL_TYPES_DOMAIN are now deprecated. These were never 2280 correct and did not work properly. 2281 2282 ** The gdb.Value type has a new constructor, which is used to construct a 2283 gdb.Value from a Python buffer object and a gdb.Type. 2284 2285 * Configure changes 2286 2287 --enable-ubsan 2288 2289 Enable or disable the undefined behavior sanitizer. This is 2290 disabled by default, but passing --enable-ubsan=yes or 2291 --enable-ubsan=auto to configure will enable it. Enabling this can 2292 cause a performance penalty. The undefined behavior sanitizer was 2293 first introduced in GCC 4.9. 2294 2295 *** Changes in GDB 8.2 2296 2297 * The 'set disassembler-options' command now supports specifying options 2298 for the MIPS target. 2299 2300 * The 'symbol-file' command now accepts an '-o' option to add a relative 2301 offset to all sections. 2302 2303 * Similarly, the 'add-symbol-file' command also accepts an '-o' option to add 2304 a relative offset to all sections, but it allows to override the load 2305 address of individual sections using '-s'. 2306 2307 * The 'add-symbol-file' command no longer requires the second argument 2308 (address of the text section). 2309 2310 * The endianness used with the 'set endian auto' mode in the absence of 2311 an executable selected for debugging is now the last endianness chosen 2312 either by one of the 'set endian big' and 'set endian little' commands 2313 or by inferring from the last executable used, rather than the startup 2314 default. 2315 2316 * The pager now allows a \\"c\\" response, meaning to disable the pager 2317 for the rest of the current command. 2318 2319 * The commands 'info variables/functions/types' now show the source line 2320 numbers of symbol definitions when available. 2321 2322 * 'info proc' now works on running processes on FreeBSD systems and core 2323 files created on FreeBSD systems. 2324 2325 * C expressions can now use _Alignof, and C++ expressions can now use 2326 alignof. 2327 2328 * Support for SVE on AArch64 Linux. Note that GDB does not detect changes to 2329 the vector length while the process is running. 2330 2331 * New commands 2332 2333 set debug fbsd-nat 2334 show debug fbsd-nat 2335 Control display of debugging info regarding the FreeBSD native target. 2336 2337 set|show varsize-limit 2338 This new setting allows the user to control the maximum size of Ada 2339 objects being printed when those objects have a variable type, 2340 instead of that maximum size being hardcoded to 65536 bytes. 2341 2342 set|show record btrace cpu 2343 Controls the processor to be used for enabling errata workarounds for 2344 branch trace decode. 2345 2346 maint check libthread-db 2347 Run integrity checks on the current inferior's thread debugging 2348 library 2349 2350 maint set check-libthread-db (on|off) 2351 maint show check-libthread-db 2352 Control whether to run integrity checks on inferior specific thread 2353 debugging libraries as they are loaded. The default is not to 2354 perform such checks. 2355 2356 * Python API 2357 2358 ** Type alignment is now exposed via the \\"align\\" attribute of a gdb.Type. 2359 2360 ** The commands attached to a breakpoint can be set by assigning to 2361 the breakpoint's \\"commands\\" field. 2362 2363 ** gdb.execute can now execute multi-line gdb commands. 2364 2365 ** The new functions gdb.convenience_variable and 2366 gdb.set_convenience_variable can be used to get and set the value 2367 of convenience variables. 2368 2369 ** A gdb.Parameter will no longer print the \\"set\\" help text on an 2370 ordinary \\"set\\"; instead by default a \\"set\\" will be silent unless 2371 the get_set_string method returns a non-empty string. 2372 2373 * New targets 2374 2375 RiscV ELF riscv*-*-elf 2376 2377 * Removed targets and native configurations 2378 2379 m88k running OpenBSD m88*-*-openbsd* 2380 SH-5/SH64 ELF sh64-*-elf*, SH-5/SH64 support in sh* 2381 SH-5/SH64 running GNU/Linux SH-5/SH64 support in sh*-*-linux* 2382 SH-5/SH64 running OpenBSD SH-5/SH64 support in sh*-*-openbsd* 2383 2384 * Aarch64/Linux hardware watchpoints improvements 2385 2386 Hardware watchpoints on unaligned addresses are now properly 2387 supported when running Linux kernel 4.10 or higher: read and access 2388 watchpoints are no longer spuriously missed, and all watchpoints 2389 lengths between 1 and 8 bytes are supported. On older kernels, 2390 watchpoints set on unaligned addresses are no longer missed, with 2391 the tradeoff that there is a possibility of false hits being 2392 reported. 2393 2394 * Configure changes 2395 2396 --enable-codesign=CERT 2397 This can be used to invoke \\"codesign -s CERT\\" after building gdb. 2398 This option is useful on macOS, where code signing is required for 2399 gdb to work properly. 2400 2401 --disable-gdbcli has been removed 2402 This is now silently accepted, but does nothing. 2403 2404 *** Changes in GDB 8.1 2405 2406 * GDB now supports dynamically creating arbitrary register groups specified 2407 in XML target descriptions. This allows for finer grain grouping of 2408 registers on systems with a large amount of registers. 2409 2410 * The 'ptype' command now accepts a '/o' flag, which prints the 2411 offsets and sizes of fields in a struct, like the pahole(1) tool. 2412 2413 * New \\"--readnever\\" command line option instructs GDB to not read each 2414 symbol file's symbolic debug information. This makes startup faster 2415 but at the expense of not being able to perform symbolic debugging. 2416 This option is intended for use cases where symbolic debugging will 2417 not be used, e.g., when you only need to dump the debuggee's core. 2418 2419 * GDB now uses the GNU MPFR library, if available, to emulate target 2420 floating-point arithmetic during expression evaluation when the target 2421 uses different floating-point formats than the host. At least version 2422 3.1 of GNU MPFR is required. 2423 2424 * GDB now supports access to the guarded-storage-control registers and the 2425 software-based guarded-storage broadcast control registers on IBM z14. 2426 2427 * On Unix systems, GDB now supports transmitting environment variables 2428 that are to be set or unset to GDBserver. These variables will 2429 affect the environment to be passed to the remote inferior. 2430 2431 To inform GDB of environment variables that are to be transmitted to 2432 GDBserver, use the \\"set environment\\" command. Only user set 2433 environment variables are sent to GDBserver. 2434 2435 To inform GDB of environment variables that are to be unset before 2436 the remote inferior is started by the GDBserver, use the \\"unset 2437 environment\\" command. 2438 2439 * Completion improvements 2440 2441 ** GDB can now complete function parameters in linespecs and 2442 explicit locations without quoting. When setting breakpoints, 2443 quoting around functions names to help with TAB-completion is 2444 generally no longer necessary. For example, this now completes 2445 correctly: 2446 2447 (gdb) b function(in[TAB] 2448 (gdb) b function(int) 2449 2450 Related, GDB is no longer confused with completing functions in 2451 C++ anonymous namespaces: 2452 2453 (gdb) b (anon[TAB] 2454 (gdb) b (anonymous namespace)::[TAB][TAB] 2455 (anonymous namespace)::a_function() 2456 (anonymous namespace)::b_function() 2457 2458 ** GDB now has much improved linespec and explicit locations TAB 2459 completion support, that better understands what you're 2460 completing and offers better suggestions. For example, GDB no 2461 longer offers data symbols as possible completions when you're 2462 setting a breakpoint. 2463 2464 ** GDB now TAB-completes label symbol names. 2465 2466 ** The \\"complete\\" command now mimics TAB completion accurately. 2467 2468 * New command line options (gcore) 2469 2470 -a 2471 Dump all memory mappings. 2472 2473 * Breakpoints on C++ functions are now set on all scopes by default 2474 2475 By default, breakpoints on functions/methods are now interpreted as 2476 specifying all functions with the given name ignoring missing 2477 leading scopes (namespaces and classes). 2478 2479 For example, assuming a C++ program with symbols named: 2480 2481 A::B::func() 2482 B::func() 2483 2484 both commands \\"break func()\\" and \\"break B::func()\\" set a breakpoint 2485 on both symbols. 2486 2487 You can use the new flag \\"-qualified\\" to override this. This makes 2488 GDB interpret the specified function name as a complete 2489 fully-qualified name instead. For example, using the same C++ 2490 program, the \\"break -q B::func\\" command sets a breakpoint on 2491 \\"B::func\\", only. A parameter has been added to the Python 2492 gdb.Breakpoint constructor to achieve the same result when creating 2493 a breakpoint from Python. 2494 2495 * Breakpoints on functions marked with C++ ABI tags 2496 2497 GDB can now set breakpoints on functions marked with C++ ABI tags 2498 (e.g., [abi:cxx11]). See here for a description of ABI tags: 2499 https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/ 2500 2501 Functions with a C++11 abi tag are demangled/displayed like this: 2502 2503 function[abi:cxx11](int) 2504 ^^^^^^^^^^^ 2505 2506 You can now set a breakpoint on such functions simply as if they had 2507 no tag, like: 2508 2509 (gdb) b function(int) 2510 2511 Or if you need to disambiguate between tags, like: 2512 2513 (gdb) b function[abi:other_tag](int) 2514 2515 Tab completion was adjusted accordingly as well. 2516 2517 * Python Scripting 2518 2519 ** New events gdb.new_inferior, gdb.inferior_deleted, and 2520 gdb.new_thread are emitted. See the manual for further 2521 description of these. 2522 2523 ** A new function, \\"gdb.rbreak\\" has been added to the Python API. 2524 This function allows the setting of a large number of breakpoints 2525 via a regex pattern in Python. See the manual for further details. 2526 2527 ** Python breakpoints can now accept explicit locations. See the 2528 manual for a further description of this feature. 2529 2530 2531 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 2532 2533 ** GDBserver is now able to start inferior processes with a 2534 specified initial working directory. 2535 2536 The user can set the desired working directory to be used from 2537 GDB using the new \\"set cwd\\" command. 2538 2539 ** New \\"--selftest\\" command line option runs some GDBserver self 2540 tests. These self tests are disabled in releases. 2541 2542 ** On Unix systems, GDBserver now does globbing expansion and variable 2543 substitution in inferior command line arguments. 2544 2545 This is done by starting inferiors using a shell, like GDB does. 2546 See \\"set startup-with-shell\\" in the user manual for how to disable 2547 this from GDB when using \\"target extended-remote\\". When using 2548 \\"target remote\\", you can disable the startup with shell by using the 2549 new \\"--no-startup-with-shell\\" GDBserver command line option. 2550 2551 ** On Unix systems, GDBserver now supports receiving environment 2552 variables that are to be set or unset from GDB. These variables 2553 will affect the environment to be passed to the inferior. 2554 2555 * When catching an Ada exception raised with a message, GDB now prints 2556 the message in the catchpoint hit notification. In GDB/MI mode, that 2557 information is provided as an extra field named \\"exception-message\\" 2558 in the *stopped notification. 2559 2560 * Trait objects can now be inspected When debugging Rust code. This 2561 requires compiler support which will appear in Rust 1.24. 2562 2563 * New remote packets 2564 2565 QEnvironmentHexEncoded 2566 Inform GDBserver of an environment variable that is to be passed to 2567 the inferior when starting it. 2568 2569 QEnvironmentUnset 2570 Inform GDBserver of an environment variable that is to be unset 2571 before starting the remote inferior. 2572 2573 QEnvironmentReset 2574 Inform GDBserver that the environment should be reset (i.e., 2575 user-set environment variables should be unset). 2576 2577 QStartupWithShell 2578 Indicates whether the inferior must be started with a shell or not. 2579 2580 QSetWorkingDir 2581 Tell GDBserver that the inferior to be started should use a specific 2582 working directory. 2583 2584 * The \\"maintenance print c-tdesc\\" command now takes an optional 2585 argument which is the file name of XML target description. 2586 2587 * The \\"maintenance selftest\\" command now takes an optional argument to 2588 filter the tests to be run. 2589 2590 * The \\"enable\\", and \\"disable\\" commands now accept a range of 2591 breakpoint locations, e.g. \\"enable 1.3-5\\". 2592 2593 * New commands 2594 2595 set|show cwd 2596 Set and show the current working directory for the inferior. 2597 2598 set|show compile-gcc 2599 Set and show compilation command used for compiling and injecting code 2600 with the 'compile' commands. 2601 2602 set debug separate-debug-file 2603 show debug separate-debug-file 2604 Control the display of debug output about separate debug file search. 2605 2606 set dump-excluded-mappings 2607 show dump-excluded-mappings 2608 Control whether mappings marked with the VM_DONTDUMP flag should be 2609 dumped when generating a core file. 2610 2611 maint info selftests 2612 List the registered selftests. 2613 2614 starti 2615 Start the debugged program stopping at the first instruction. 2616 2617 set|show debug or1k 2618 Control display of debugging messages related to OpenRISC targets. 2619 2620 set|show print type nested-type-limit 2621 Set and show the limit of nesting level for nested types that the 2622 type printer will show. 2623 2624 * TUI Single-Key mode now supports two new shortcut keys: \`i' for stepi and 2625 \`o' for nexti. 2626 2627 * Safer/improved support for debugging with no debug info 2628 2629 GDB no longer assumes functions with no debug information return 2630 'int'. 2631 2632 This means that GDB now refuses to call such functions unless you 2633 tell it the function's type, by either casting the call to the 2634 declared return type, or by casting the function to a function 2635 pointer of the right type, and calling that: 2636 2637 (gdb) p getenv (\\"PATH\\") 2638 'getenv' has unknown return type; cast the call to its declared return type 2639 (gdb) p (char *) getenv (\\"PATH\\") 2640 1 = 0x7fffffffe \\"/usr/local/bin:/\\"... 2641 (gdb) p ((char * (*) (const char *)) getenv) (\\"PATH\\") 2642 2 = 0x7fffffffe \\"/usr/local/bin:/\\"... 2643 2644 Similarly, GDB no longer assumes that global variables with no debug 2645 info have type 'int', and refuses to print the variable's value 2646 unless you tell it the variable's type: 2647 2648 (gdb) p var 2649 'var' has unknown type; cast it to its declared type 2650 (gdb) p (float) var 2651 3 = 3.14 2652 2653 * New native configurations 2654 2655 FreeBSD/aarch64 aarch64*-*-freebsd* 2656 FreeBSD/arm arm*-*-freebsd* 2657 2658 * New targets 2659 2660 FreeBSD/aarch64 aarch64*-*-freebsd* 2661 FreeBSD/arm arm*-*-freebsd* 2662 OpenRISC ELF or1k*-*-elf 2663 2664 * Removed targets and native configurations 2665 2666 Solaris 2.0-9 i?86-*-solaris2.[0-9], sparc*-*-solaris2.[0-9] 2667 2668 *** Changes in GDB 8.0 2669 2670 * GDB now supports access to the PKU register on GNU/Linux. The register is 2671 added by the Memory Protection Keys for Userspace feature which will be 2672 available in future Intel CPUs. 2673 2674 * GDB now supports C++11 rvalue references. 2675 2676 * Python Scripting 2677 2678 ** New functions to start, stop and access a running btrace recording. 2679 ** Rvalue references are now supported in gdb.Type. 2680 2681 * GDB now supports recording and replaying rdrand and rdseed Intel 64 2682 instructions. 2683 2684 * Building GDB and GDBserver now requires a C++11 compiler. 2685 2686 For example, GCC 4.8 or later. 2687 2688 It is no longer possible to build GDB or GDBserver with a C 2689 compiler. The --disable-build-with-cxx configure option has been 2690 removed. 2691 2692 * Building GDB and GDBserver now requires GNU make >= 3.81. 2693 2694 It is no longer supported to build GDB or GDBserver with another 2695 implementation of the make program or an earlier version of GNU make. 2696 2697 * Native debugging on MS-Windows supports command-line redirection 2698 2699 Command-line arguments used for starting programs on MS-Windows can 2700 now include redirection symbols supported by native Windows shells, 2701 such as '<', '>', '>>', '2>&1', etc. This affects GDB commands such 2702 as \\"run\\", \\"start\\", and \\"set args\\", as well as the corresponding MI 2703 features. 2704 2705 * Support for thread names on MS-Windows. 2706 2707 GDB now catches and handles the special exception that programs 2708 running on MS-Windows use to assign names to threads in the 2709 debugger. 2710 2711 * Support for Java programs compiled with gcj has been removed. 2712 2713 * User commands now accept an unlimited number of arguments. 2714 Previously, only up to 10 was accepted. 2715 2716 * The \\"eval\\" command now expands user-defined command arguments. 2717 2718 This makes it easier to process a variable number of arguments: 2719 2720 define mycommand 2721 set i = 0 2722 while i < argc 2723 eval \\"print arg%d\\", i 2724 set i = i + 1 2725 end 2726 end 2727 2728 * Target descriptions can now describe registers for sparc32 and sparc64. 2729 2730 * GDB now supports DWARF version 5 (debug information format). 2731 Its .debug_names index is not yet supported. 2732 2733 * New native configurations 2734 2735 FreeBSD/mips mips*-*-freebsd 2736 2737 * New targets 2738 2739 Synopsys ARC arc*-*-elf32 2740 FreeBSD/mips mips*-*-freebsd 2741 2742 * Removed targets and native configurations 2743 2744 Alpha running FreeBSD alpha*-*-freebsd* 2745 Alpha running GNU/kFreeBSD alpha*-*-kfreebsd*-gnu 2746 2747 * New commands 2748 2749 flash-erase 2750 Erases all the flash memory regions reported by the target. 2751 2752 maint print arc arc-instruction address 2753 Print internal disassembler information about instruction at a given address. 2754 2755 * New options 2756 2757 set disassembler-options 2758 show disassembler-options 2759 Controls the passing of target specific information to the disassembler. 2760 If it is necessary to specify more than one disassembler option then 2761 multiple options can be placed together into a comma separated list. 2762 The default value is the empty string. Currently, the only supported 2763 targets are ARM, PowerPC and S/390. 2764 2765 * New MI commands 2766 2767 -target-flash-erase 2768 Erases all the flash memory regions reported by the target. This is 2769 equivalent to the CLI command flash-erase. 2770 2771 -file-list-shared-libraries 2772 List the shared libraries in the program. This is 2773 equivalent to the CLI command \\"info shared\\". 2774 2775 -catch-handlers 2776 Catchpoints stopping the program when Ada exceptions are 2777 handled. This is equivalent to the CLI command \\"catch handlers\\". 2778 2779 *** Changes in GDB 7.12 2780 2781 * GDB and GDBserver now build with a C++ compiler by default. 2782 2783 The --enable-build-with-cxx configure option is now enabled by 2784 default. One must now explicitly configure with 2785 --disable-build-with-cxx in order to build with a C compiler. This 2786 option will be removed in a future release. 2787 2788 * GDBserver now supports recording btrace without maintaining an active 2789 GDB connection. 2790 2791 * GDB now supports a negative repeat count in the 'x' command to examine 2792 memory backward from the given address. For example: 2793 2794 (gdb) bt 2795 #0 Func1 (n=42, p=0x40061c \\"hogehoge\\") at main.cpp:4 2796 #1 0x400580 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe5c8) at main.cpp:8 2797 (gdb) x/-5i 0x0000000000400580 2798 0x40056a <main(int, char**)+8>: mov %edi,-0x4(%rbp) 2799 0x40056d <main(int, char**)+11>: mov %rsi,-0x10(%rbp) 2800 0x400571 <main(int, char**)+15>: mov 0x40061c,%esi 2801 0x400576 <main(int, char**)+20>: mov 0x2a,%edi 2802 0x40057b <main(int, char**)+25>: 2803 callq 0x400536 <Func1(int, char const*)> 2804 2805 * Fortran: Support structures with fields of dynamic types and 2806 arrays of dynamic types. 2807 2808 * The symbol dumping maintenance commands have new syntax. 2809 maint print symbols [-pc address] [--] [filename] 2810 maint print symbols [-objfile objfile] [-source source] [--] [filename] 2811 maint print psymbols [-objfile objfile] [-pc address] [--] [filename] 2812 maint print psymbols [-objfile objfile] [-source source] [--] [filename] 2813 maint print msymbols [-objfile objfile] [--] [filename] 2814 2815 * GDB now supports multibit bitfields and enums in target register 2816 descriptions. 2817 2818 * New Python-based convenience function _as_string(val), which returns 2819 the textual representation of a value. This function is especially 2820 useful to obtain the text label of an enum value. 2821 2822 * Intel MPX bound violation handling. 2823 2824 Segmentation faults caused by a Intel MPX boundary violation 2825 now display the kind of violation (upper or lower), the memory 2826 address accessed and the memory bounds, along with the usual 2827 signal received and code location. 2828 2829 For example: 2830 2831 Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault 2832 Upper bound violation while accessing address 0x7fffffffc3b3 2833 Bounds: [lower = 0x7fffffffc390, upper = 0x7fffffffc3a3] 2834 0x0000000000400d7c in upper () at i386-mpx-sigsegv.c:68 2835 2836 * Rust language support. 2837 GDB now supports debugging programs written in the Rust programming 2838 language. See https://www.rust-lang.org/ for more information about 2839 Rust. 2840 2841 * Support for running interpreters on specified input/output devices 2842 2843 GDB now supports a new mechanism that allows frontends to provide 2844 fully featured GDB console views, as a better alternative to 2845 building such views on top of the \\"-interpreter-exec console\\" 2846 command. See the new \\"new-ui\\" command below. With that command, 2847 frontends can now start GDB in the traditional command-line mode 2848 running in an embedded terminal emulator widget, and create a 2849 separate MI interpreter running on a specified i/o device. In this 2850 way, GDB handles line editing, history, tab completion, etc. in the 2851 console all by itself, and the GUI uses the separate MI interpreter 2852 for its own control and synchronization, invisible to the command 2853 line. 2854 2855 * The \\"catch syscall\\" command catches groups of related syscalls. 2856 2857 The \\"catch syscall\\" command now supports catching a group of related 2858 syscalls using the 'group:' or 'g:' prefix. 2859 2860 * New commands 2861 2862 skip -file file 2863 skip -gfile file-glob-pattern 2864 skip -function function 2865 skip -rfunction regular-expression 2866 A generalized form of the skip command, with new support for 2867 glob-style file names and regular expressions for function names. 2868 Additionally, a file spec and a function spec may now be combined. 2869 2870 maint info line-table REGEXP 2871 Display the contents of GDB's internal line table data structure. 2872 2873 maint selftest 2874 Run any GDB unit tests that were compiled in. 2875 2876 new-ui INTERP TTY 2877 Start a new user interface instance running INTERP as interpreter, 2878 using the TTY file for input/output. 2879 2880 * Python Scripting 2881 2882 ** gdb.Breakpoint objects have a new attribute \\"pending\\", which 2883 indicates whether the breakpoint is pending. 2884 ** Three new breakpoint-related events have been added: 2885 gdb.breakpoint_created, gdb.breakpoint_modified, and 2886 gdb.breakpoint_deleted. 2887 2888 signal-event EVENTID 2889 Signal (\\"set\\") the given MS-Windows event object. This is used in 2890 conjunction with the Windows JIT debugging (AeDebug) support, where 2891 the OS suspends a crashing process until a debugger can attach to 2892 it. Resuming the crashing process, in order to debug it, is done by 2893 signalling an event. 2894 2895 * Support for tracepoints and fast tracepoints on s390-linux and s390x-linux 2896 was added in GDBserver, including JIT compiling fast tracepoint's 2897 conditional expression bytecode into native code. 2898 2899 * Support for various remote target protocols and ROM monitors has 2900 been removed: 2901 2902 target m32rsdi Remote M32R debugging over SDI 2903 target mips MIPS remote debugging protocol 2904 target pmon PMON ROM monitor 2905 target ddb NEC's DDB variant of PMON for Vr4300 2906 target rockhopper NEC RockHopper variant of PMON 2907 target lsi LSI variant of PMO 2908 2909 * Support for tracepoints and fast tracepoints on powerpc-linux, 2910 powerpc64-linux, and powerpc64le-linux was added in GDBserver, 2911 including JIT compiling fast tracepoint's conditional expression 2912 bytecode into native code. 2913 2914 * MI async record =record-started now includes the method and format used for 2915 recording. For example: 2916 2917 =record-started,thread-group=\\"i1\\",method=\\"btrace\\",format=\\"bts\\" 2918 2919 * MI async record =thread-selected now includes the frame field. For example: 2920 2921 =thread-selected,id=\\"3\\",frame={level=\\"0\\",addr=\\"0x00000000004007c0\\"} 2922 2923 * New targets 2924 2925 Andes NDS32 nds32*-*-elf 2926 2927 *** Changes in GDB 7.11 2928 2929 * GDB now supports debugging kernel-based threads on FreeBSD. 2930 2931 * Per-inferior thread numbers 2932 2933 Thread numbers are now per inferior instead of global. If you're 2934 debugging multiple inferiors, GDB displays thread IDs using a 2935 qualified INF_NUM.THR_NUM form. For example: 2936 2937 (gdb) info threads 2938 Id Target Id Frame 2939 1.1 Thread 0x7ffff7fc2740 (LWP 8155) (running) 2940 1.2 Thread 0x7ffff7fc1700 (LWP 8168) (running) 2941 * 2.1 Thread 0x7ffff7fc2740 (LWP 8157) (running) 2942 2.2 Thread 0x7ffff7fc1700 (LWP 8190) (running) 2943 2944 As consequence, thread numbers as visible in the _thread 2945 convenience variable and in Python's InferiorThread.num attribute 2946 are no longer unique between inferiors. 2947 2948 GDB now maintains a second thread ID per thread, referred to as the 2949 global thread ID, which is the new equivalent of thread numbers in 2950 previous releases. See also _gthread below. 2951 2952 For backwards compatibility, MI's thread IDs always refer to global 2953 IDs. 2954 2955 * Commands that accept thread IDs now accept the qualified 2956 INF_NUM.THR_NUM form as well. For example: 2957 2958 (gdb) thread 2.1 2959 [Switching to thread 2.1 (Thread 0x7ffff7fc2740 (LWP 8157))] (running) 2960 (gdb) 2961 2962 * In commands that accept a list of thread IDs, you can now refer to 2963 all threads of an inferior using a star wildcard. GDB accepts 2964 \\"INF_NUM.*\\", to refer to all threads of inferior INF_NUM, and \\"*\\" to 2965 refer to all threads of the current inferior. For example, \\"info 2966 threads 2.*\\". 2967 2968 * You can use \\"info threads -gid\\" to display the global thread ID of 2969 all threads. 2970 2971 * The new convenience variable _gthread holds the global number of 2972 the current thread. 2973 2974 * The new convenience variable _inferior holds the number of the 2975 current inferior. 2976 2977 * GDB now displays the ID and name of the thread that hit a breakpoint 2978 or received a signal, if your program is multi-threaded. For 2979 example: 2980 2981 Thread 3 \\"bar\\" hit Breakpoint 1 at 0x40087a: file program.c, line 20. 2982 Thread 1 \\"main\\" received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. 2983 2984 * Record btrace now supports non-stop mode. 2985 2986 * Support for tracepoints on aarch64-linux was added in GDBserver. 2987 2988 * The 'record instruction-history' command now indicates speculative execution 2989 when using the Intel Processor Trace recording format. 2990 2991 * GDB now allows users to specify explicit locations, bypassing 2992 the linespec parser. This feature is also available to GDB/MI 2993 clients. 2994 2995 * Multi-architecture debugging is supported on AArch64 GNU/Linux. 2996 GDB now is able to debug both AArch64 applications and ARM applications 2997 at the same time. 2998 2999 * Support for fast tracepoints on aarch64-linux was added in GDBserver, 3000 including JIT compiling fast tracepoint's conditional expression bytecode 3001 into native code. 3002 3003 * GDB now supports displaced stepping on AArch64 GNU/Linux. 3004 3005 * \\"info threads\\", \\"info inferiors\\", \\"info display\\", \\"info checkpoints\\" 3006 and \\"maint info program-spaces\\" now list the corresponding items in 3007 ascending ID order, for consistency with all other \\"info\\" commands. 3008 3009 * In Ada, the overloads selection menu has been enhanced to display the 3010 parameter types and the return types for the matching overloaded subprograms. 3011 3012 * New commands 3013 3014 maint set target-non-stop (on|off|auto) 3015 maint show target-non-stop 3016 Control whether GDB targets always operate in non-stop mode even if 3017 \\"set non-stop\\" is \\"off\\". The default is \\"auto\\", meaning non-stop 3018 mode is enabled if supported by the target. 3019 3020 maint set bfd-sharing 3021 maint show bfd-sharing 3022 Control the reuse of bfd objects. 3023 3024 set debug bfd-cache 3025 show debug bfd-cache 3026 Control display of debugging info regarding bfd caching. 3027 3028 set debug fbsd-lwp 3029 show debug fbsd-lwp 3030 Control display of debugging info regarding FreeBSD threads. 3031 3032 set remote multiprocess-extensions-packet 3033 show remote multiprocess-extensions-packet 3034 Set/show the use of the remote protocol multiprocess extensions. 3035 3036 set remote thread-events 3037 show remote thread-events 3038 Set/show the use of thread create/exit events. 3039 3040 set ada print-signatures on|off 3041 show ada print-signatures\\" 3042 Control whether parameter types and return types are displayed in overloads 3043 selection menus. It is activated (@code{on}) by default. 3044 3045 set max-value-size 3046 show max-value-size 3047 Controls the maximum size of memory, in bytes, that GDB will 3048 allocate for value contents. Prevents incorrect programs from 3049 causing GDB to allocate overly large buffers. Default is 64k. 3050 3051 * The \\"disassemble\\" command accepts a new modifier: /s. 3052 It prints mixed source+disassembly like /m with two differences: 3053 - disassembled instructions are now printed in program order, and 3054 - and source for all relevant files is now printed. 3055 The \\"/m\\" option is now considered deprecated: its \\"source-centric\\" 3056 output hasn't proved useful in practice. 3057 3058 * The \\"record instruction-history\\" command accepts a new modifier: /s. 3059 It behaves exactly like /m and prints mixed source+disassembly. 3060 3061 * The \\"set scheduler-locking\\" command supports a new mode \\"replay\\". 3062 It behaves like \\"off\\" in record mode and like \\"on\\" in replay mode. 3063 3064 * Support for various ROM monitors has been removed: 3065 3066 target dbug dBUG ROM monitor for Motorola ColdFire 3067 target picobug Motorola picobug monitor 3068 target dink32 DINK32 ROM monitor for PowerPC 3069 target m32r Renesas M32R/D ROM monitor 3070 target mon2000 mon2000 ROM monitor 3071 target ppcbug PPCBUG ROM monitor for PowerPC 3072 3073 * Support for reading/writing memory and extracting values on architectures 3074 whose memory is addressable in units of any integral multiple of 8 bits. 3075 3076 catch handlers 3077 Allows to break when an Ada exception is handled. 3078 3079 * New remote packets 3080 3081 exec stop reason 3082 Indicates that an exec system call was executed. 3083 3084 exec-events feature in qSupported 3085 The qSupported packet allows GDB to request support for exec 3086 events using the new 'gdbfeature' exec-event, and the qSupported 3087 response can contain the corresponding 'stubfeature'. Set and 3088 show commands can be used to display whether these features are enabled. 3089 3090 vCtrlC 3091 Equivalent to interrupting with the ^C character, but works in 3092 non-stop mode. 3093 3094 thread created stop reason (T05 create:...) 3095 Indicates that the thread was just created and is stopped at entry. 3096 3097 thread exit stop reply (w exitcode;tid) 3098 Indicates that the thread has terminated. 3099 3100 QThreadEvents 3101 Enables/disables thread create and exit event reporting. For 3102 example, this is used in non-stop mode when GDB stops a set of 3103 threads and synchronously waits for the their corresponding stop 3104 replies. Without exit events, if one of the threads exits, GDB 3105 would hang forever not knowing that it should no longer expect a 3106 stop for that same thread. 3107 3108 N stop reply 3109 Indicates that there are no resumed threads left in the target (all 3110 threads are stopped). The remote stub reports support for this stop 3111 reply to GDB's qSupported query. 3112 3113 QCatchSyscalls 3114 Enables/disables catching syscalls from the inferior process. 3115 The remote stub reports support for this packet to GDB's qSupported query. 3116 3117 syscall_entry stop reason 3118 Indicates that a syscall was just called. 3119 3120 syscall_return stop reason 3121 Indicates that a syscall just returned. 3122 3123 * Extended-remote exec events 3124 3125 ** GDB now has support for exec events on extended-remote Linux targets. 3126 For such targets with Linux kernels 2.5.46 and later, this enables 3127 follow-exec-mode and exec catchpoints. 3128 3129 set remote exec-event-feature-packet 3130 show remote exec-event-feature-packet 3131 Set/show the use of the remote exec event feature. 3132 3133 * Thread names in remote protocol 3134 3135 The reply to qXfer:threads:read may now include a name attribute for each 3136 thread. 3137 3138 * Target remote mode fork and exec events 3139 3140 ** GDB now has support for fork and exec events on target remote mode 3141 Linux targets. For such targets with Linux kernels 2.5.46 and later, 3142 this enables follow-fork-mode, detach-on-fork, follow-exec-mode, and 3143 fork and exec catchpoints. 3144 3145 * Remote syscall events 3146 3147 ** GDB now has support for catch syscall on remote Linux targets, 3148 currently enabled on x86/x86_64 architectures. 3149 3150 set remote catch-syscall-packet 3151 show remote catch-syscall-packet 3152 Set/show the use of the remote catch syscall feature. 3153 3154 * MI changes 3155 3156 ** The -var-set-format command now accepts the zero-hexadecimal 3157 format. It outputs data in hexadecimal format with zero-padding on the 3158 left. 3159 3160 * Python Scripting 3161 3162 ** gdb.InferiorThread objects have a new attribute \\"global_num\\", 3163 which refers to the thread's global thread ID. The existing 3164 \\"num\\" attribute now refers to the thread's per-inferior number. 3165 See \\"Per-inferior thread numbers\\" above. 3166 ** gdb.InferiorThread objects have a new attribute \\"inferior\\", which 3167 is the Inferior object the thread belongs to. 3168 3169 *** Changes in GDB 7.10 3170 3171 * Support for process record-replay and reverse debugging on aarch64*-linux* 3172 targets has been added. GDB now supports recording of A64 instruction set 3173 including advance SIMD instructions. 3174 3175 * Support for Sun's version of the \\"stabs\\" debug file format has been removed. 3176 3177 * GDB now honors the content of the file /proc/PID/coredump_filter 3178 (PID is the process ID) on GNU/Linux systems. This file can be used 3179 to specify the types of memory mappings that will be included in a 3180 corefile. For more information, please refer to the manual page of 3181 \\"core(5)\\". GDB also has a new command: \\"set use-coredump-filter 3182 on|off\\". It allows to set whether GDB will read the content of the 3183 /proc/PID/coredump_filter file when generating a corefile. 3184 3185 * The \\"info os\\" command on GNU/Linux can now display information on 3186 cpu information : 3187 \\"info os cpus\\" Listing of all cpus/cores on the system 3188 3189 * GDB has two new commands: \\"set serial parity odd|even|none\\" and 3190 \\"show serial parity\\". These allows to set or show parity for the 3191 remote serial I/O. 3192 3193 * The \\"info source\\" command now displays the producer string if it was 3194 present in the debug info. This typically includes the compiler version 3195 and may include things like its command line arguments. 3196 3197 * The \\"info dll\\", an alias of the \\"info sharedlibrary\\" command, 3198 is now available on all platforms. 3199 3200 * Directory names supplied to the \\"set sysroot\\" commands may be 3201 prefixed with \\"target:\\" to tell GDB to access shared libraries from 3202 the target system, be it local or remote. This replaces the prefix 3203 \\"remote:\\". The default sysroot has been changed from \\"\\" to 3204 \\"target:\\". \\"remote:\\" is automatically converted to \\"target:\\" for 3205 backward compatibility. 3206 3207 * The system root specified by \\"set sysroot\\" will be prepended to the 3208 filename of the main executable (if reported to GDB as absolute by 3209 the operating system) when starting processes remotely, and when 3210 attaching to already-running local or remote processes. 3211 3212 * GDB now supports automatic location and retrieval of executable 3213 files from remote targets. Remote debugging can now be initiated 3214 using only a \\"target remote\\" or \\"target extended-remote\\" command 3215 (no \\"set sysroot\\" or \\"file\\" commands are required). See \\"New remote 3216 packets\\" below. 3217 3218 * The \\"dump\\" command now supports verilog hex format. 3219 3220 * GDB now supports the vector ABI on S/390 GNU/Linux targets. 3221 3222 * On GNU/Linux, GDB and gdbserver are now able to access executable 3223 and shared library files without a \\"set sysroot\\" command when 3224 attaching to processes running in different mount namespaces from 3225 the debugger. This makes it possible to attach to processes in 3226 containers as simply as \\"gdb -p PID\\" or \\"gdbserver --attach PID\\". 3227 See \\"New remote packets\\" below. 3228 3229 * The \\"tui reg\\" command now provides completion for all of the 3230 available register groups, including target specific groups. 3231 3232 * The HISTSIZE environment variable is no longer read when determining 3233 the size of GDB's command history. GDB now instead reads the dedicated 3234 GDBHISTSIZE environment variable. Setting GDBHISTSIZE to \\"-1\\" or to \\"\\" now 3235 disables truncation of command history. Non-numeric values of GDBHISTSIZE 3236 are ignored. 3237 3238 * Guile Scripting 3239 3240 ** Memory ports can now be unbuffered. 3241 3242 * Python Scripting 3243 3244 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new attribute \\"username\\", 3245 which is the name of the objfile as specified by the user, 3246 without, for example, resolving symlinks. 3247 ** You can now write frame unwinders in Python. 3248 ** gdb.Type objects have a new method \\"optimized_out\\", 3249 returning optimized out gdb.Value instance of this type. 3250 ** gdb.Value objects have new methods \\"reference_value\\" and 3251 \\"const_value\\" which return a reference to the value and a 3252 \\"const\\" version of the value respectively. 3253 3254 * New commands 3255 3256 maint print symbol-cache 3257 Print the contents of the symbol cache. 3258 3259 maint print symbol-cache-statistics 3260 Print statistics of symbol cache usage. 3261 3262 maint flush-symbol-cache 3263 Flush the contents of the symbol cache. 3264 3265 record btrace bts 3266 record bts 3267 Start branch trace recording using Branch Trace Store (BTS) format. 3268 3269 compile print 3270 Evaluate expression by using the compiler and print result. 3271 3272 tui enable 3273 tui disable 3274 Explicit commands for enabling and disabling tui mode. 3275 3276 show mpx bound 3277 set mpx bound on i386 and amd64 3278 Support for bound table investigation on Intel MPX enabled applications. 3279 3280 record btrace pt 3281 record pt 3282 Start branch trace recording using Intel Processor Trace format. 3283 3284 maint info btrace 3285 Print information about branch tracing internals. 3286 3287 maint btrace packet-history 3288 Print the raw branch tracing data. 3289 3290 maint btrace clear-packet-history 3291 Discard the stored raw branch tracing data. 3292 3293 maint btrace clear 3294 Discard all branch tracing data. It will be fetched and processed 3295 anew by the next \\"record\\" command. 3296 3297 * New options 3298 3299 set debug dwarf-die 3300 Renamed from \\"set debug dwarf2-die\\". 3301 show debug dwarf-die 3302 Renamed from \\"show debug dwarf2-die\\". 3303 3304 set debug dwarf-read 3305 Renamed from \\"set debug dwarf2-read\\". 3306 show debug dwarf-read 3307 Renamed from \\"show debug dwarf2-read\\". 3308 3309 maint set dwarf always-disassemble 3310 Renamed from \\"maint set dwarf2 always-disassemble\\". 3311 maint show dwarf always-disassemble 3312 Renamed from \\"maint show dwarf2 always-disassemble\\". 3313 3314 maint set dwarf max-cache-age 3315 Renamed from \\"maint set dwarf2 max-cache-age\\". 3316 maint show dwarf max-cache-age 3317 Renamed from \\"maint show dwarf2 max-cache-age\\". 3318 3319 set debug dwarf-line 3320 show debug dwarf-line 3321 Control display of debugging info regarding DWARF line processing. 3322 3323 set max-completions 3324 show max-completions 3325 Set the maximum number of candidates to be considered during 3326 completion. The default value is 200. This limit allows GDB 3327 to avoid generating large completion lists, the computation of 3328 which can cause the debugger to become temporarily unresponsive. 3329 3330 set history remove-duplicates 3331 show history remove-duplicates 3332 Control the removal of duplicate history entries. 3333 3334 maint set symbol-cache-size 3335 maint show symbol-cache-size 3336 Control the size of the symbol cache. 3337 3338 set|show record btrace bts buffer-size 3339 Set and show the size of the ring buffer used for branch tracing in 3340 BTS format. 3341 The obtained size may differ from the requested size. Use \\"info 3342 record\\" to see the obtained buffer size. 3343 3344 set debug linux-namespaces 3345 show debug linux-namespaces 3346 Control display of debugging info regarding Linux namespaces. 3347 3348 set|show record btrace pt buffer-size 3349 Set and show the size of the ring buffer used for branch tracing in 3350 Intel Processor Trace format. 3351 The obtained size may differ from the requested size. Use \\"info 3352 record\\" to see the obtained buffer size. 3353 3354 maint set|show btrace pt skip-pad 3355 Set and show whether PAD packets are skipped when computing the 3356 packet history. 3357 3358 * The command 'thread apply all' can now support new option '-ascending' 3359 to call its specified command for all threads in ascending order. 3360 3361 * Python/Guile scripting 3362 3363 ** GDB now supports auto-loading of Python/Guile scripts contained in the 3364 special section named \`.debug_gdb_scripts'. 3365 3366 * New remote packets 3367 3368 qXfer:btrace-conf:read 3369 Return the branch trace configuration for the current thread. 3370 3371 Qbtrace-conf:bts:size 3372 Set the requested ring buffer size for branch tracing in BTS format. 3373 3374 Qbtrace:pt 3375 Enable Intel Processor Trace-based branch tracing for the current 3376 process. The remote stub reports support for this packet to GDB's 3377 qSupported query. 3378 3379 Qbtrace-conf:pt:size 3380 Set the requested ring buffer size for branch tracing in Intel Processor 3381 Trace format. 3382 3383 swbreak stop reason 3384 Indicates a memory breakpoint instruction was executed, irrespective 3385 of whether it was GDB that planted the breakpoint or the breakpoint 3386 is hardcoded in the program. This is required for correct non-stop 3387 mode operation. 3388 3389 hwbreak stop reason 3390 Indicates the target stopped for a hardware breakpoint. This is 3391 required for correct non-stop mode operation. 3392 3393 vFile:fstat: 3394 Return information about files on the remote system. 3395 3396 qXfer:exec-file:read 3397 Return the full absolute name of the file that was executed to 3398 create a process running on the remote system. 3399 3400 vFile:setfs: 3401 Select the filesystem on which vFile: operations with filename 3402 arguments will operate. This is required for GDB to be able to 3403 access files on remote targets where the remote stub does not 3404 share a common filesystem with the inferior(s). 3405 3406 fork stop reason 3407 Indicates that a fork system call was executed. 3408 3409 vfork stop reason 3410 Indicates that a vfork system call was executed. 3411 3412 vforkdone stop reason 3413 Indicates that a vfork child of the specified process has executed 3414 an exec or exit, allowing the vfork parent to resume execution. 3415 3416 fork-events and vfork-events features in qSupported 3417 The qSupported packet allows GDB to request support for fork and 3418 vfork events using new 'gdbfeatures' fork-events and vfork-events, 3419 and the qSupported response can contain the corresponding 3420 'stubfeatures'. Set and show commands can be used to display 3421 whether these features are enabled. 3422 3423 * Extended-remote fork events 3424 3425 ** GDB now has support for fork events on extended-remote Linux 3426 targets. For targets with Linux kernels 2.5.60 and later, this 3427 enables follow-fork-mode and detach-on-fork for both fork and 3428 vfork, as well as fork and vfork catchpoints. 3429 3430 * The info record command now shows the recording format and the 3431 branch tracing configuration for the current thread when using 3432 the btrace record target. 3433 For the BTS format, it shows the ring buffer size. 3434 3435 * GDB now has support for DTrace USDT (Userland Static Defined 3436 Tracing) probes. The supported targets are x86_64-*-linux-gnu. 3437 3438 * GDB now supports access to vector registers on S/390 GNU/Linux 3439 targets. 3440 3441 * Removed command line options 3442 3443 -xdb HP-UX XDB compatibility mode. 3444 3445 * Removed targets and native configurations 3446 3447 HP/PA running HP-UX hppa*-*-hpux* 3448 Itanium running HP-UX ia64-*-hpux* 3449 3450 * New configure options 3451 3452 --with-intel-pt 3453 This configure option allows the user to build GDB with support for 3454 Intel Processor Trace (default: auto). This requires libipt. 3455 3456 --with-libipt-prefix=PATH 3457 Specify the path to the version of libipt that GDB should use. 3458 PATH/include should contain the intel-pt.h header and 3459 PATH/lib should contain the libipt.so library. 3460 3461 *** Changes in GDB 7.9.1 3462 3463 * Python Scripting 3464 3465 ** Xmethods can now specify a result type. 3466 3467 *** Changes in GDB 7.9 3468 3469 * GDB now supports hardware watchpoints on x86 GNU Hurd. 3470 3471 * Python Scripting 3472 3473 ** You can now access frame registers from Python scripts. 3474 ** New attribute 'producer' for gdb.Symtab objects. 3475 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new attribute \\"progspace\\", 3476 which is the gdb.Progspace object of the containing program space. 3477 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new attribute \\"owner\\". 3478 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new attribute \\"build_id\\", 3479 which is the build ID generated when the file was built. 3480 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new method \\"add_separate_debug_file\\". 3481 ** A new event \\"gdb.clear_objfiles\\" has been added, triggered when 3482 selecting a new file to debug. 3483 ** You can now add attributes to gdb.Objfile and gdb.Progspace objects. 3484 ** New function gdb.lookup_objfile. 3485 3486 New events which are triggered when GDB modifies the state of the 3487 inferior. 3488 3489 ** gdb.events.inferior_call_pre: Function call is about to be made. 3490 ** gdb.events.inferior_call_post: Function call has just been made. 3491 ** gdb.events.memory_changed: A memory location has been altered. 3492 ** gdb.events.register_changed: A register has been altered. 3493 3494 * New Python-based convenience functions: 3495 3496 ** _caller_is(name [, number_of_frames]) 3497 ** _caller_matches(regexp [, number_of_frames]) 3498 ** _any_caller_is(name [, number_of_frames]) 3499 ** _any_caller_matches(regexp [, number_of_frames]) 3500 3501 * GDB now supports the compilation and injection of source code into 3502 the inferior. GDB will use GCC 5.0 or higher built with libcc1.so 3503 to compile the source code to object code, and if successful, inject 3504 and execute that code within the current context of the inferior. 3505 Currently the C language is supported. The commands used to 3506 interface with this new feature are: 3507 3508 compile code [-raw|-r] [--] [source code] 3509 compile file [-raw|-r] filename 3510 3511 * New commands 3512 3513 demangle [-l language] [--] name 3514 Demangle \\"name\\" in the specified language, or the current language 3515 if elided. This command is renamed from the \\"maint demangle\\" command. 3516 The latter is kept as a no-op to avoid \\"maint demangle\\" being interpreted 3517 as \\"maint demangler-warning\\". 3518 3519 queue-signal signal-name-or-number 3520 Queue a signal to be delivered to the thread when it is resumed. 3521 3522 add-auto-load-scripts-directory directory 3523 Add entries to the list of directories from which to load auto-loaded 3524 scripts. 3525 3526 maint print user-registers 3527 List all currently available \\"user\\" registers. 3528 3529 compile code [-r|-raw] [--] [source code] 3530 Compile, inject, and execute in the inferior the executable object 3531 code produced by compiling the provided source code. 3532 3533 compile file [-r|-raw] filename 3534 Compile and inject into the inferior the executable object code 3535 produced by compiling the source code stored in the filename 3536 provided. 3537 3538 * On resume, GDB now always passes the signal the program had stopped 3539 for to the thread the signal was sent to, even if the user changed 3540 threads before resuming. Previously GDB would often (but not 3541 always) deliver the signal to the thread that happens to be current 3542 at resume time. 3543 3544 * Conversely, the \\"signal\\" command now consistently delivers the 3545 requested signal to the current thread. GDB now asks for 3546 confirmation if the program had stopped for a signal and the user 3547 switched threads meanwhile. 3548 3549 * \\"breakpoint always-inserted\\" modes \\"off\\" and \\"auto\\" merged. 3550 3551 Now, when 'breakpoint always-inserted mode' is set to \\"off\\", GDB 3552 won't remove breakpoints from the target until all threads stop, 3553 even in non-stop mode. The \\"auto\\" mode has been removed, and \\"off\\" 3554 is now the default mode. 3555 3556 * New options 3557 3558 set debug symbol-lookup 3559 show debug symbol-lookup 3560 Control display of debugging info regarding symbol lookup. 3561 3562 * MI changes 3563 3564 ** The -list-thread-groups command outputs an exit-code field for 3565 inferiors that have exited. 3566 3567 * New targets 3568 3569 MIPS SDE mips*-sde*-elf* 3570 3571 * Removed targets 3572 3573 Support for these obsolete configurations has been removed. 3574 3575 Alpha running OSF/1 (or Tru64) alpha*-*-osf* 3576 SGI Irix-5.x mips-*-irix5* 3577 SGI Irix-6.x mips-*-irix6* 3578 VAX running (4.2 - 4.3 Reno) BSD vax-*-bsd* 3579 VAX running Ultrix vax-*-ultrix* 3580 3581 * The \\"dll-symbols\\" command, and its two aliases (\\"add-shared-symbol-files\\" 3582 and \\"assf\\"), have been removed. Use the \\"sharedlibrary\\" command, or 3583 its alias \\"share\\", instead. 3584 3585 *** Changes in GDB 7.8 3586 3587 * New command line options 3588 3589 -D data-directory 3590 This is an alias for the --data-directory option. 3591 3592 * GDB supports printing and modifying of variable length automatic arrays 3593 as specified in ISO C99. 3594 3595 * The ARM simulator now supports instruction level tracing 3596 with or without disassembly. 3597 3598 * Guile scripting 3599 3600 GDB now has support for scripting using Guile. Whether this is 3601 available is determined at configure time. 3602 Guile version 2.0 or greater is required. 3603 Guile version 2.0.9 is well tested, earlier 2.0 versions are not. 3604 3605 * New commands (for set/show, see \\"New options\\" below) 3606 3607 guile [code] 3608 gu [code] 3609 Invoke CODE by passing it to the Guile interpreter. 3610 3611 guile-repl 3612 gr 3613 Start a Guile interactive prompt (or \\"repl\\" for \\"read-eval-print loop\\"). 3614 3615 info auto-load guile-scripts [regexp] 3616 Print the list of automatically loaded Guile scripts. 3617 3618 * The source command is now capable of sourcing Guile scripts. 3619 This feature is dependent on the debugger being built with Guile support. 3620 3621 * New options 3622 3623 set print symbol-loading (off|brief|full) 3624 show print symbol-loading 3625 Control whether to print informational messages when loading symbol 3626 information for a file. The default is \\"full\\", but when debugging 3627 programs with large numbers of shared libraries the amount of output 3628 becomes less useful. 3629 3630 set guile print-stack (none|message|full) 3631 show guile print-stack 3632 Show a stack trace when an error is encountered in a Guile script. 3633 3634 set auto-load guile-scripts (on|off) 3635 show auto-load guile-scripts 3636 Control auto-loading of Guile script files. 3637 3638 maint ada set ignore-descriptive-types (on|off) 3639 maint ada show ignore-descriptive-types 3640 Control whether the debugger should ignore descriptive types in Ada 3641 programs. The default is not to ignore the descriptive types. See 3642 the user manual for more details on descriptive types and the intended 3643 usage of this option. 3644 3645 set auto-connect-native-target 3646 3647 Control whether GDB is allowed to automatically connect to the 3648 native target for the run, attach, etc. commands when not connected 3649 to any target yet. See also \\"target native\\" below. 3650 3651 set record btrace replay-memory-access (read-only|read-write) 3652 show record btrace replay-memory-access 3653 Control what memory accesses are allowed during replay. 3654 3655 maint set target-async (on|off) 3656 maint show target-async 3657 This controls whether GDB targets operate in synchronous or 3658 asynchronous mode. Normally the default is asynchronous, if it is 3659 available; but this can be changed to more easily debug problems 3660 occurring only in synchronous mode. 3661 3662 set mi-async (on|off) 3663 show mi-async 3664 Control whether MI asynchronous mode is preferred. This supersedes 3665 \\"set target-async\\" of previous GDB versions. 3666 3667 * \\"set target-async\\" is deprecated as a CLI option and is now an alias 3668 for \\"set mi-async\\" (only puts MI into async mode). 3669 3670 * Background execution commands (e.g., \\"c&\\", \\"s&\\", etc.) are now 3671 possible \`\`out of the box'' if the target supports them. Previously 3672 the user would need to explicitly enable the possibility with the 3673 \\"set target-async on\\" command. 3674 3675 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 3676 3677 ** New option --debug-format=option1[,option2,...] allows one to add 3678 additional text to each output. At present only timestamps 3679 are supported: --debug-format=timestamps. 3680 Timestamps can also be turned on with the 3681 \\"monitor set debug-format timestamps\\" command from GDB. 3682 3683 * The 'record instruction-history' command now starts counting instructions 3684 at one. This also affects the instruction ranges reported by the 3685 'record function-call-history' command when given the /i modifier. 3686 3687 * The command 'record function-call-history' supports a new modifier '/c' to 3688 indent the function names based on their call stack depth. 3689 The fields for the '/i' and '/l' modifier have been reordered. 3690 The source line range is now prefixed with 'at'. 3691 The instruction range is now prefixed with 'inst'. 3692 Both ranges are now printed as '<from>, <to>' to allow copy&paste to the 3693 \\"record instruction-history\\" and \\"list\\" commands. 3694 3695 * The ranges given as arguments to the 'record function-call-history' and 3696 'record instruction-history' commands are now inclusive. 3697 3698 * The btrace record target now supports the 'record goto' command. 3699 For locations inside the execution trace, the back trace is computed 3700 based on the information stored in the execution trace. 3701 3702 * The btrace record target supports limited reverse execution and replay. 3703 The target does not record data and therefore does not allow reading 3704 memory or registers. 3705 3706 * The \\"catch syscall\\" command now works on s390*-linux* targets. 3707 3708 * The \\"compare-sections\\" command is no longer specific to target 3709 remote. It now works with all targets. 3710 3711 * All native targets are now consistently called \\"native\\". 3712 Consequently, the \\"target child\\", \\"target GNU\\", \\"target djgpp\\", 3713 \\"target procfs\\" (Solaris/Irix/OSF/AIX) and \\"target darwin-child\\" 3714 commands have been replaced with \\"target native\\". The QNX/NTO port 3715 leaves the \\"procfs\\" target in place and adds a \\"native\\" target for 3716 consistency with other ports. The impact on users should be minimal 3717 as these commands previously either throwed an error, or were 3718 no-ops. The target's name is visible in the output of the following 3719 commands: \\"help target\\", \\"info target\\", \\"info files\\", \\"maint print 3720 target-stack\\". 3721 3722 * The \\"target native\\" command now connects to the native target. This 3723 can be used to launch native programs even when \\"set 3724 auto-connect-native-target\\" is set to off. 3725 3726 * GDB now supports access to Intel MPX registers on GNU/Linux. 3727 3728 * Support for Intel AVX-512 registers on GNU/Linux. 3729 Support displaying and modifying Intel AVX-512 registers 3730 zmm0 - zmm31 and k0 - k7 on GNU/Linux. 3731 3732 * New remote packets 3733 3734 qXfer:btrace:read's annex 3735 The qXfer:btrace:read packet supports a new annex 'delta' to read 3736 branch trace incrementally. 3737 3738 * Python Scripting 3739 3740 ** Valid Python operations on gdb.Value objects representing 3741 structs/classes invoke the corresponding overloaded operators if 3742 available. 3743 ** New \`Xmethods' feature in the Python API. Xmethods are 3744 additional methods or replacements for existing methods of a C++ 3745 class. This feature is useful for those cases where a method 3746 defined in C++ source code could be inlined or optimized out by 3747 the compiler, making it unavailable to GDB. 3748 3749 * New targets 3750 PowerPC64 GNU/Linux little-endian powerpc64le-*-linux* 3751 3752 * The \\"dll-symbols\\" command, and its two aliases (\\"add-shared-symbol-files\\" 3753 and \\"assf\\"), have been deprecated. Use the \\"sharedlibrary\\" command, or 3754 its alias \\"share\\", instead. 3755 3756 * The commands \\"set remotebaud\\" and \\"show remotebaud\\" are no longer 3757 supported. Use \\"set serial baud\\" and \\"show serial baud\\" (respectively) 3758 instead. 3759 3760 * MI changes 3761 3762 ** A new option \\"-gdb-set mi-async\\" replaces \\"-gdb-set 3763 target-async\\". The latter is left as a deprecated alias of the 3764 former for backward compatibility. If the target supports it, 3765 CLI background execution commands are now always possible by 3766 default, independently of whether the frontend stated a 3767 preference for asynchronous execution with \\"-gdb-set mi-async\\". 3768 Previously \\"-gdb-set target-async off\\" affected both MI execution 3769 commands and CLI execution commands. 3770 3771 *** Changes in GDB 7.7 3772 3773 * Improved support for process record-replay and reverse debugging on 3774 arm*-linux* targets. Support for thumb32 and syscall instruction 3775 recording has been added. 3776 3777 * GDB now supports SystemTap SDT probes on AArch64 GNU/Linux. 3778 3779 * GDB now supports Fission DWP file format version 2. 3780 http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission 3781 3782 * New convenience function \\"_isvoid\\", to check whether an expression 3783 is void. A void expression is an expression where the type of the 3784 result is \\"void\\". For example, some convenience variables may be 3785 \\"void\\" when evaluated (e.g., \\"_exitcode\\" before the execution of 3786 the program being debugged; or an undefined convenience variable). 3787 Another example, when calling a function whose return type is 3788 \\"void\\". 3789 3790 * The \\"maintenance print objfiles\\" command now takes an optional regexp. 3791 3792 * The \\"catch syscall\\" command now works on arm*-linux* targets. 3793 3794 * GDB now consistently shows \\"<not saved>\\" when printing values of 3795 registers the debug info indicates have not been saved in the frame 3796 and there's nowhere to retrieve them from 3797 (callee-saved/call-clobbered registers): 3798 3799 (gdb) p rax 3800 1 = <not saved> 3801 3802 (gdb) info registers rax 3803 rax <not saved> 3804 3805 Before, the former would print \\"<optimized out>\\", and the latter 3806 \\"*value not available*\\". 3807 3808 * New script contrib/gdb-add-index.sh for adding .gdb_index sections 3809 to binaries. 3810 3811 * Python scripting 3812 3813 ** Frame filters and frame decorators have been added. 3814 ** Temporary breakpoints are now supported. 3815 ** Line tables representation has been added. 3816 ** New attribute 'parent_type' for gdb.Field objects. 3817 ** gdb.Field objects can be used as subscripts on gdb.Value objects. 3818 ** New attribute 'name' for gdb.Type objects. 3819 3820 * New targets 3821 3822 Nios II ELF nios2*-*-elf 3823 Nios II GNU/Linux nios2*-*-linux 3824 Texas Instruments MSP430 msp430*-*-elf 3825 3826 * Removed native configurations 3827 3828 Support for these a.out NetBSD and OpenBSD obsolete configurations has 3829 been removed. ELF variants of these configurations are kept supported. 3830 3831 arm*-*-netbsd* but arm*-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3832 i[34567]86-*-netbsd* but i[34567]86-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3833 i[34567]86-*-openbsd[0-2].* but i[34567]86-*-openbsd* is kept supported. 3834 i[34567]86-*-openbsd3.[0-3] 3835 m68*-*-netbsd* but m68*-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3836 sparc-*-netbsd* but sparc-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3837 vax-*-netbsd* but vax-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3838 3839 * New commands: 3840 catch rethrow 3841 Like \\"catch throw\\", but catches a re-thrown exception. 3842 maint check-psymtabs 3843 Renamed from old \\"maint check-symtabs\\". 3844 maint check-symtabs 3845 Perform consistency checks on symtabs. 3846 maint expand-symtabs 3847 Expand symtabs matching an optional regexp. 3848 3849 show configuration 3850 Display the details of GDB configure-time options. 3851 3852 maint set|show per-command 3853 maint set|show per-command space 3854 maint set|show per-command time 3855 maint set|show per-command symtab 3856 Enable display of per-command gdb resource usage. 3857 3858 remove-symbol-file FILENAME 3859 remove-symbol-file -a ADDRESS 3860 Remove a symbol file added via add-symbol-file. The file to remove 3861 can be identified by its filename or by an address that lies within 3862 the boundaries of this symbol file in memory. 3863 3864 info exceptions 3865 info exceptions REGEXP 3866 Display the list of Ada exceptions defined in the program being 3867 debugged. If provided, only the exceptions whose names match REGEXP 3868 are listed. 3869 3870 * New options 3871 3872 set debug symfile off|on 3873 show debug symfile 3874 Control display of debugging info regarding reading symbol files and 3875 symbol tables within those files 3876 3877 set print raw frame-arguments 3878 show print raw frame-arguments 3879 Set/show whether to print frame arguments in raw mode, 3880 disregarding any defined pretty-printers. 3881 3882 set remote trace-status-packet 3883 show remote trace-status-packet 3884 Set/show the use of remote protocol qTStatus packet. 3885 3886 set debug nios2 3887 show debug nios2 3888 Control display of debugging messages related to Nios II targets. 3889 3890 set range-stepping 3891 show range-stepping 3892 Control whether target-assisted range stepping is enabled. 3893 3894 set startup-with-shell 3895 show startup-with-shell 3896 Specifies whether Unix child processes are started via a shell or 3897 directly. 3898 3899 set code-cache 3900 show code-cache 3901 Use the target memory cache for accesses to the code segment. This 3902 improves performance of remote debugging (particularly disassembly). 3903 3904 * You can now use a literal value 'unlimited' for options that 3905 interpret 0 or -1 as meaning \\"unlimited\\". E.g., \\"set 3906 trace-buffer-size unlimited\\" is now an alias for \\"set 3907 trace-buffer-size -1\\" and \\"set height unlimited\\" is now an alias for 3908 \\"set height 0\\". 3909 3910 * The \\"set debug symtab-create\\" debugging option of GDB has been changed to 3911 accept a verbosity level. 0 means \\"off\\", 1 provides basic debugging 3912 output, and values of 2 or greater provides more verbose output. 3913 3914 * New command-line options 3915 --configuration 3916 Display the details of GDB configure-time options. 3917 3918 * The command 'tsave' can now support new option '-ctf' to save trace 3919 buffer in Common Trace Format. 3920 3921 * Newly installed prefix/bin/gcore acts as a shell interface for the 3922 GDB command gcore. 3923 3924 * GDB now implements the C++ 'typeid' operator. 3925 3926 * The new convenience variable _exception holds the exception being 3927 thrown or caught at an exception-related catchpoint. 3928 3929 * The exception-related catchpoints, like \\"catch throw\\", now accept a 3930 regular expression which can be used to filter exceptions by type. 3931 3932 * The new convenience variable _exitsignal is automatically set to 3933 the terminating signal number when the program being debugged dies 3934 due to an uncaught signal. 3935 3936 * MI changes 3937 3938 ** All MI commands now accept an optional \\"--language\\" option. 3939 Support for this feature can be verified by using the \\"-list-features\\" 3940 command, which should contain \\"language-option\\". 3941 3942 ** The new command -info-gdb-mi-command allows the user to determine 3943 whether a GDB/MI command is supported or not. 3944 3945 ** The \\"^error\\" result record returned when trying to execute an undefined 3946 GDB/MI command now provides a variable named \\"code\\" whose content is the 3947 \\"undefined-command\\" error code. Support for this feature can be verified 3948 by using the \\"-list-features\\" command, which should contain 3949 \\"undefined-command-error-code\\". 3950 3951 ** The -trace-save MI command can optionally save trace buffer in Common 3952 Trace Format now. 3953 3954 ** The new command -dprintf-insert sets a dynamic printf breakpoint. 3955 3956 ** The command -data-list-register-values now accepts an optional 3957 \\"--skip-unavailable\\" option. When used, only the available registers 3958 are displayed. 3959 3960 ** The new command -trace-frame-collected dumps collected variables, 3961 computed expressions, tvars, memory and registers in a traceframe. 3962 3963 ** The commands -stack-list-locals, -stack-list-arguments and 3964 -stack-list-variables now accept an option \\"--skip-unavailable\\". 3965 When used, only the available locals or arguments are displayed. 3966 3967 ** The -exec-run command now accepts an optional \\"--start\\" option. 3968 When used, the command follows the same semantics as the \\"start\\" 3969 command, stopping the program's execution at the start of its 3970 main subprogram. Support for this feature can be verified using 3971 the \\"-list-features\\" command, which should contain 3972 \\"exec-run-start-option\\". 3973 3974 ** The new commands -catch-assert and -catch-exceptions insert 3975 catchpoints stopping the program when Ada exceptions are raised. 3976 3977 ** The new command -info-ada-exceptions provides the equivalent of 3978 the new \\"info exceptions\\" command. 3979 3980 * New system-wide configuration scripts 3981 A GDB installation now provides scripts suitable for use as system-wide 3982 configuration scripts for the following systems: 3983 ** ElinOS 3984 ** Wind River Linux 3985 3986 * GDB now supports target-assigned range stepping with remote targets. 3987 This improves the performance of stepping source lines by reducing 3988 the number of control packets from/to GDB. See \\"New remote packets\\" 3989 below. 3990 3991 * GDB now understands the element 'tvar' in the XML traceframe info. 3992 It has the id of the collected trace state variables. 3993 3994 * On S/390 targets that provide the transactional-execution feature, 3995 the program interruption transaction diagnostic block (TDB) is now 3996 represented as a number of additional \\"registers\\" in GDB. 3997 3998 * New remote packets 3999 4000 vCont;r 4001 4002 The vCont packet supports a new 'r' action, that tells the remote 4003 stub to step through an address range itself, without GDB 4004 involvemement at each single-step. 4005 4006 qXfer:libraries-svr4:read's annex 4007 The previously unused annex of the qXfer:libraries-svr4:read packet 4008 is now used to support passing an argument list. The remote stub 4009 reports support for this argument list to GDB's qSupported query. 4010 The defined arguments are \\"start\\" and \\"prev\\", used to reduce work 4011 necessary for library list updating, resulting in significant 4012 speedup. 4013 4014 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 4015 4016 ** GDBserver now supports target-assisted range stepping. Currently 4017 enabled on x86/x86_64 GNU/Linux targets. 4018 4019 ** GDBserver now adds element 'tvar' in the XML in the reply to 4020 'qXfer:traceframe-info:read'. It has the id of the collected 4021 trace state variables. 4022 4023 ** GDBserver now supports hardware watchpoints on the MIPS GNU/Linux 4024 target. 4025 4026 * New 'z' formatter for printing and examining memory, this displays the 4027 value as hexadecimal zero padded on the left to the size of the type. 4028 4029 * GDB can now use Windows x64 unwinding data. 4030 4031 * The \\"set remotebaud\\" command has been replaced by \\"set serial baud\\". 4032 Similarly, \\"show remotebaud\\" has been replaced by \\"show serial baud\\". 4033 The \\"set remotebaud\\" and \\"show remotebaud\\" commands are still available 4034 to provide backward compatibility with older versions of GDB. 4035 4036 *** Changes in GDB 7.6 4037 4038 * Target record has been renamed to record-full. 4039 Record/replay is now enabled with the \\"record full\\" command. 4040 This also affects settings that are associated with full record/replay 4041 that have been moved from \\"set/show record\\" to \\"set/show record full\\": 4042 4043 set|show record full insn-number-max 4044 set|show record full stop-at-limit 4045 set|show record full memory-query 4046 4047 * A new record target \\"record-btrace\\" has been added. The new target 4048 uses hardware support to record the control-flow of a process. It 4049 does not support replaying the execution, but it implements the 4050 below new commands for investigating the recorded execution log. 4051 This new recording method can be enabled using: 4052 4053 record btrace 4054 4055 The \\"record-btrace\\" target is only available on Intel Atom processors 4056 and requires a Linux kernel 2.6.32 or later. 4057 4058 * Two new commands have been added for record/replay to give information 4059 about the recorded execution without having to replay the execution. 4060 The commands are only supported by \\"record btrace\\". 4061 4062 record instruction-history prints the execution history at 4063 instruction granularity 4064 4065 record function-call-history prints the execution history at 4066 function granularity 4067 4068 * New native configurations 4069 4070 ARM AArch64 GNU/Linux aarch64*-*-linux-gnu 4071 FreeBSD/powerpc powerpc*-*-freebsd 4072 x86_64/Cygwin x86_64-*-cygwin* 4073 Tilera TILE-Gx GNU/Linux tilegx*-*-linux-gnu 4074 4075 * New targets 4076 4077 ARM AArch64 aarch64*-*-elf 4078 ARM AArch64 GNU/Linux aarch64*-*-linux 4079 Lynx 178 PowerPC powerpc-*-lynx*178 4080 x86_64/Cygwin x86_64-*-cygwin* 4081 Tilera TILE-Gx GNU/Linux tilegx*-*-linux 4082 4083 * If the configured location of system.gdbinit file (as given by the 4084 --with-system-gdbinit option at configure time) is in the 4085 data-directory (as specified by --with-gdb-datadir at configure 4086 time) or in one of its subdirectories, then GDB will look for the 4087 system-wide init file in the directory specified by the 4088 --data-directory command-line option. 4089 4090 * New command line options: 4091 4092 -nh Disables auto-loading of ~/.gdbinit, but still executes all the 4093 other initialization files, unlike -nx which disables all of them. 4094 4095 * Removed command line options 4096 4097 -epoch This was used by the gdb mode in Epoch, an ancient fork of 4098 Emacs. 4099 4100 * The 'ptype' and 'whatis' commands now accept an argument to control 4101 type formatting. 4102 4103 * 'info proc' now works on some core files. 4104 4105 * Python scripting 4106 4107 ** Vectors can be created with gdb.Type.vector. 4108 4109 ** Python's atexit.register now works in GDB. 4110 4111 ** Types can be pretty-printed via a Python API. 4112 4113 ** Python 3 is now supported (in addition to Python 2.4 or later) 4114 4115 ** New class gdb.Architecture exposes GDB's internal representation 4116 of architecture in the Python API. 4117 4118 ** New method Frame.architecture returns the gdb.Architecture object 4119 corresponding to the frame's architecture. 4120 4121 * New Python-based convenience functions: 4122 4123 ** _memeq(buf1, buf2, length) 4124 ** _streq(str1, str2) 4125 ** _strlen(str) 4126 ** _regex(str, regex) 4127 4128 * The 'cd' command now defaults to using '~' (the home directory) if not 4129 given an argument. 4130 4131 * The C++ ABI now defaults to the GNU v3 ABI. This has been the 4132 default for GCC since November 2000. 4133 4134 * The command 'forward-search' can now be abbreviated as 'fo'. 4135 4136 * The command 'info tracepoints' can now display 'installed on target' 4137 or 'not installed on target' for each non-pending location of tracepoint. 4138 4139 * New configure options 4140 4141 --enable-libmcheck/--disable-libmcheck 4142 By default, development versions are built with -lmcheck on hosts 4143 that support it, in order to help track memory corruption issues. 4144 Release versions, on the other hand, are built without -lmcheck 4145 by default. The --enable-libmcheck/--disable-libmcheck configure 4146 options allow the user to override that default. 4147 --with-babeltrace/--with-babeltrace-include/--with-babeltrace-lib 4148 This configure option allows the user to build GDB with 4149 libbabeltrace using which GDB can read Common Trace Format data. 4150 4151 * New commands (for set/show, see \\"New options\\" below) 4152 4153 catch signal 4154 Catch signals. This is similar to \\"handle\\", but allows commands and 4155 conditions to be attached. 4156 4157 maint info bfds 4158 List the BFDs known to GDB. 4159 4160 python-interactive [command] 4161 pi [command] 4162 Start a Python interactive prompt, or evaluate the optional command 4163 and print the result of expressions. 4164 4165 py [command] 4166 \\"py\\" is a new alias for \\"python\\". 4167 4168 enable type-printer [name]... 4169 disable type-printer [name]... 4170 Enable or disable type printers. 4171 4172 * Removed commands 4173 4174 ** For the Renesas Super-H architecture, the \\"regs\\" command has been removed 4175 (has been deprecated in GDB 7.5), and \\"info all-registers\\" should be used 4176 instead. 4177 4178 * New options 4179 4180 set print type methods (on|off) 4181 show print type methods 4182 Control whether method declarations are displayed by \\"ptype\\". 4183 The default is to show them. 4184 4185 set print type typedefs (on|off) 4186 show print type typedefs 4187 Control whether typedef definitions are displayed by \\"ptype\\". 4188 The default is to show them. 4189 4190 set filename-display basename|relative|absolute 4191 show filename-display 4192 Control the way in which filenames is displayed. 4193 The default is \\"relative\\", which preserves previous behavior. 4194 4195 set trace-buffer-size 4196 show trace-buffer-size 4197 Request target to change the size of trace buffer. 4198 4199 set remote trace-buffer-size-packet auto|on|off 4200 show remote trace-buffer-size-packet 4201 Control the use of the remote protocol \`QTBuffer:size' packet. 4202 4203 set debug aarch64 4204 show debug aarch64 4205 Control display of debugging messages related to ARM AArch64. 4206 The default is off. 4207 4208 set debug coff-pe-read 4209 show debug coff-pe-read 4210 Control display of debugging messages related to reading of COFF/PE 4211 exported symbols. 4212 4213 set debug mach-o 4214 show debug mach-o 4215 Control display of debugging messages related to Mach-O symbols 4216 processing. 4217 4218 set debug notification 4219 show debug notification 4220 Control display of debugging info for async remote notification. 4221 4222 * MI changes 4223 4224 ** Command parameter changes are now notified using new async record 4225 \\"=cmd-param-changed\\". 4226 ** Trace frame changes caused by command \\"tfind\\" are now notified using 4227 new async record \\"=traceframe-changed\\". 4228 ** The creation, deletion and modification of trace state variables 4229 are now notified using new async records \\"=tsv-created\\", 4230 \\"=tsv-deleted\\" and \\"=tsv-modified\\". 4231 ** The start and stop of process record are now notified using new 4232 async record \\"=record-started\\" and \\"=record-stopped\\". 4233 ** Memory changes are now notified using new async record 4234 \\"=memory-changed\\". 4235 ** The data-disassemble command response will include a \\"fullname\\" field 4236 containing the absolute file name when source has been requested. 4237 ** New optional parameter COUNT added to the \\"-data-write-memory-bytes\\" 4238 command, to allow pattern filling of memory areas. 4239 ** New commands \\"-catch-load\\"/\\"-catch-unload\\" added for intercepting 4240 library load/unload events. 4241 ** The response to breakpoint commands and breakpoint async records 4242 includes an \\"installed\\" field containing a boolean state about each 4243 non-pending tracepoint location is whether installed on target or not. 4244 ** Output of the \\"-trace-status\\" command includes a \\"trace-file\\" field 4245 containing the name of the trace file being examined. This field is 4246 optional, and only present when examining a trace file. 4247 ** The \\"fullname\\" field is now always present along with the \\"file\\" field, 4248 even if the file cannot be found by GDB. 4249 4250 * GDB now supports the \\"mini debuginfo\\" section, .gnu_debugdata. 4251 You must have the LZMA library available when configuring GDB for this 4252 feature to be enabled. For more information, see: 4253 http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/MiniDebugInfo 4254 4255 * New remote packets 4256 4257 QTBuffer:size 4258 Set the size of trace buffer. The remote stub reports support for this 4259 packet to gdb's qSupported query. 4260 4261 Qbtrace:bts 4262 Enable Branch Trace Store (BTS)-based branch tracing for the current 4263 thread. The remote stub reports support for this packet to gdb's 4264 qSupported query. 4265 4266 Qbtrace:off 4267 Disable branch tracing for the current thread. The remote stub reports 4268 support for this packet to gdb's qSupported query. 4269 4270 qXfer:btrace:read 4271 Read the traced branches for the current thread. The remote stub 4272 reports support for this packet to gdb's qSupported query. 4273 4274 *** Changes in GDB 7.5 4275 4276 * GDB now supports x32 ABI. Visit <http://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/> 4277 for more x32 ABI info. 4278 4279 * GDB now supports access to MIPS DSP registers on Linux targets. 4280 4281 * GDB now supports debugging microMIPS binaries. 4282 4283 * The \\"info os\\" command on GNU/Linux can now display information on 4284 several new classes of objects managed by the operating system: 4285 \\"info os procgroups\\" lists process groups 4286 \\"info os files\\" lists file descriptors 4287 \\"info os sockets\\" lists internet-domain sockets 4288 \\"info os shm\\" lists shared-memory regions 4289 \\"info os semaphores\\" lists semaphores 4290 \\"info os msg\\" lists message queues 4291 \\"info os modules\\" lists loaded kernel modules 4292 4293 * GDB now has support for SDT (Static Defined Tracing) probes. Currently, 4294 the only implemented backend is for SystemTap probes (<sys/sdt.h>). You 4295 can set a breakpoint using the new \\"-probe, \\"-pstap\\" or \\"-probe-stap\\" 4296 options and inspect the probe arguments using the new _probe_arg family 4297 of convenience variables. You can obtain more information about SystemTap 4298 in <http://sourceware.org/systemtap/>. 4299 4300 * GDB now supports reversible debugging on ARM, it allows you to 4301 debug basic ARM and THUMB instructions, and provides 4302 record/replay support. 4303 4304 * The option \\"symbol-reloading\\" has been deleted as it is no longer used. 4305 4306 * Python scripting 4307 4308 ** GDB commands implemented in Python can now be put in command class 4309 \\"gdb.COMMAND_USER\\". 4310 4311 ** The \\"maint set python print-stack on|off\\" is now deleted. 4312 4313 ** A new class, gdb.printing.FlagEnumerationPrinter, can be used to 4314 apply \\"flag enum\\"-style pretty-printing to any enum. 4315 4316 ** gdb.lookup_symbol can now work when there is no current frame. 4317 4318 ** gdb.Symbol now has a 'line' attribute, holding the line number in 4319 the source at which the symbol was defined. 4320 4321 ** gdb.Symbol now has the new attribute 'needs_frame' and the new 4322 method 'value'. The former indicates whether the symbol needs a 4323 frame in order to compute its value, and the latter computes the 4324 symbol's value. 4325 4326 ** A new method 'referenced_value' on gdb.Value objects which can 4327 dereference pointer as well as C++ reference values. 4328 4329 ** New methods 'global_block' and 'static_block' on gdb.Symtab objects 4330 which return the global and static blocks (as gdb.Block objects), 4331 of the underlying symbol table, respectively. 4332 4333 ** New function gdb.find_pc_line which returns the gdb.Symtab_and_line 4334 object associated with a PC value. 4335 4336 ** gdb.Symtab_and_line has new attribute 'last' which holds the end 4337 of the address range occupied by code for the current source line. 4338 4339 * Go language support. 4340 GDB now supports debugging programs written in the Go programming 4341 language. 4342 4343 * GDBserver now supports stdio connections. 4344 E.g. (gdb) target remote | ssh myhost gdbserver - hello 4345 4346 * The binary \\"gdbtui\\" can no longer be built or installed. 4347 Use \\"gdb -tui\\" instead. 4348 4349 * GDB will now print \\"flag\\" enums specially. A flag enum is one where 4350 all the enumerator values have no bits in common when pairwise 4351 \\"and\\"ed. When printing a value whose type is a flag enum, GDB will 4352 show all the constants, e.g., for enum E { ONE = 1, TWO = 2}: 4353 (gdb) print (enum E) 3 4354 1 = (ONE | TWO) 4355 4356 * The filename part of a linespec will now match trailing components 4357 of a source file name. For example, \\"break gcc/expr.c:1000\\" will 4358 now set a breakpoint in build/gcc/expr.c, but not 4359 build/libcpp/expr.c. 4360 4361 * The \\"info proc\\" and \\"generate-core-file\\" commands will now also 4362 work on remote targets connected to GDBserver on Linux. 4363 4364 * The command \\"info catch\\" has been removed. It has been disabled 4365 since December 2007. 4366 4367 * The \\"catch exception\\" and \\"catch assert\\" commands now accept 4368 a condition at the end of the command, much like the \\"break\\" 4369 command does. For instance: 4370 4371 (gdb) catch exception Constraint_Error if Barrier = True 4372 4373 Previously, it was possible to add a condition to such catchpoints, 4374 but it had to be done as a second step, after the catchpoint had been 4375 created, using the \\"condition\\" command. 4376 4377 * The \\"info static-tracepoint-marker\\" command will now also work on 4378 native Linux targets with in-process agent. 4379 4380 * GDB can now set breakpoints on inlined functions. 4381 4382 * The .gdb_index section has been updated to include symbols for 4383 inlined functions. GDB will ignore older .gdb_index sections by 4384 default, which could cause symbol files to be loaded more slowly 4385 until their .gdb_index sections can be recreated. The new command 4386 \\"set use-deprecated-index-sections on\\" will cause GDB to use any older 4387 .gdb_index sections it finds. This will restore performance, but the 4388 ability to set breakpoints on inlined functions will be lost in symbol 4389 files with older .gdb_index sections. 4390 4391 The .gdb_index section has also been updated to record more information 4392 about each symbol. This speeds up the \\"info variables\\", \\"info functions\\" 4393 and \\"info types\\" commands when used with programs having the .gdb_index 4394 section, as well as speeding up debugging with shared libraries using 4395 the .gdb_index section. 4396 4397 * Ada support for GDB/MI Variable Objects has been added. 4398 4399 * GDB can now support 'breakpoint always-inserted mode' in 'record' 4400 target. 4401 4402 * MI changes 4403 4404 ** New command -info-os is the MI equivalent of \\"info os\\". 4405 4406 ** Output logs (\\"set logging\\" and related) now include MI output. 4407 4408 * New commands 4409 4410 ** \\"set use-deprecated-index-sections on|off\\" 4411 \\"show use-deprecated-index-sections on|off\\" 4412 Controls the use of deprecated .gdb_index sections. 4413 4414 ** \\"catch load\\" and \\"catch unload\\" can be used to stop when a shared 4415 library is loaded or unloaded, respectively. 4416 4417 ** \\"enable count\\" can be used to auto-disable a breakpoint after 4418 several hits. 4419 4420 ** \\"info vtbl\\" can be used to show the virtual method tables for 4421 C++ and Java objects. 4422 4423 ** \\"explore\\" and its sub commands \\"explore value\\" and \\"explore type\\" 4424 can be used to recursively explore values and types of 4425 expressions. These commands are available only if GDB is 4426 configured with '--with-python'. 4427 4428 ** \\"info auto-load\\" shows status of all kinds of auto-loaded files, 4429 \\"info auto-load gdb-scripts\\" shows status of auto-loading GDB canned 4430 sequences of commands files, \\"info auto-load python-scripts\\" 4431 shows status of auto-loading Python script files, 4432 \\"info auto-load local-gdbinit\\" shows status of loading init file 4433 (.gdbinit) from current directory and \\"info auto-load libthread-db\\" shows 4434 status of inferior specific thread debugging shared library loading. 4435 4436 ** \\"info auto-load-scripts\\", \\"set auto-load-scripts on|off\\" 4437 and \\"show auto-load-scripts\\" commands have been deprecated, use their 4438 \\"info auto-load python-scripts\\", \\"set auto-load python-scripts on|off\\" 4439 and \\"show auto-load python-scripts\\" counterparts instead. 4440 4441 ** \\"dprintf location,format,args...\\" creates a dynamic printf, which 4442 is basically a breakpoint that does a printf and immediately 4443 resumes your program's execution, so it is like a printf that you 4444 can insert dynamically at runtime instead of at compiletime. 4445 4446 ** \\"set print symbol\\" 4447 \\"show print symbol\\" 4448 Controls whether GDB attempts to display the symbol, if any, 4449 corresponding to addresses it prints. This defaults to \\"on\\", but 4450 you can set it to \\"off\\" to restore GDB's previous behavior. 4451 4452 * Deprecated commands 4453 4454 ** For the Renesas Super-H architecture, the \\"regs\\" command has been 4455 deprecated, and \\"info all-registers\\" should be used instead. 4456 4457 * New targets 4458 4459 Renesas RL78 rl78-*-elf 4460 HP OpenVMS ia64 ia64-hp-openvms* 4461 4462 * GDBserver supports evaluation of breakpoint conditions. When 4463 support is advertised by GDBserver, GDB may be told to send the 4464 breakpoint conditions in bytecode form to GDBserver. GDBserver 4465 will only report the breakpoint trigger to GDB when its condition 4466 evaluates to true. 4467 4468 * New options 4469 4470 set mips compression 4471 show mips compression 4472 Select the compressed ISA encoding used in functions that have no symbol 4473 information available. The encoding can be set to either of: 4474 mips16 4475 micromips 4476 and is updated automatically from ELF file flags if available. 4477 4478 set breakpoint condition-evaluation 4479 show breakpoint condition-evaluation 4480 Control whether breakpoint conditions are evaluated by GDB (\\"host\\") or by 4481 GDBserver (\\"target\\"). Default option \\"auto\\" chooses the most efficient 4482 available mode. 4483 This option can improve debugger efficiency depending on the speed of the 4484 target. 4485 4486 set auto-load off 4487 Disable auto-loading globally. 4488 4489 show auto-load 4490 Show auto-loading setting of all kinds of auto-loaded files. 4491 4492 set auto-load gdb-scripts on|off 4493 show auto-load gdb-scripts 4494 Control auto-loading of GDB canned sequences of commands files. 4495 4496 set auto-load python-scripts on|off 4497 show auto-load python-scripts 4498 Control auto-loading of Python script files. 4499 4500 set auto-load local-gdbinit on|off 4501 show auto-load local-gdbinit 4502 Control loading of init file (.gdbinit) from current directory. 4503 4504 set auto-load libthread-db on|off 4505 show auto-load libthread-db 4506 Control auto-loading of inferior specific thread debugging shared library. 4507 4508 set auto-load scripts-directory <dir1>[:<dir2>...] 4509 show auto-load scripts-directory 4510 Set a list of directories from which to load auto-loaded scripts. 4511 Automatically loaded Python scripts and GDB scripts are located in one 4512 of the directories listed by this option. 4513 The delimiter (':' above) may differ according to the host platform. 4514 4515 set auto-load safe-path <dir1>[:<dir2>...] 4516 show auto-load safe-path 4517 Set a list of directories from which it is safe to auto-load files. 4518 The delimiter (':' above) may differ according to the host platform. 4519 4520 set debug auto-load on|off 4521 show debug auto-load 4522 Control display of debugging info for auto-loading the files above. 4523 4524 set dprintf-style gdb|call|agent 4525 show dprintf-style 4526 Control the way in which a dynamic printf is performed; \\"gdb\\" 4527 requests a GDB printf command, while \\"call\\" causes dprintf to call a 4528 function in the inferior. \\"agent\\" requests that the target agent 4529 (such as GDBserver) do the printing. 4530 4531 set dprintf-function <expr> 4532 show dprintf-function 4533 set dprintf-channel <expr> 4534 show dprintf-channel 4535 Set the function and optional first argument to the call when using 4536 the \\"call\\" style of dynamic printf. 4537 4538 set disconnected-dprintf on|off 4539 show disconnected-dprintf 4540 Control whether agent-style dynamic printfs continue to be in effect 4541 after GDB disconnects. 4542 4543 * New configure options 4544 4545 --with-auto-load-dir 4546 Configure default value for the 'set auto-load scripts-directory' 4547 setting above. It defaults to 'debugdir:datadir/auto-load', 4548 debugdir representing global debugging info directories (available 4549 via 'show debug-file-directory') and datadir representing GDB's data 4550 directory (available via 'show data-directory'). 4551 4552 --with-auto-load-safe-path 4553 Configure default value for the 'set auto-load safe-path' setting 4554 above. It defaults to the --with-auto-load-dir setting. 4555 4556 --without-auto-load-safe-path 4557 Set 'set auto-load safe-path' to '/', effectively disabling this 4558 security feature. 4559 4560 * New remote packets 4561 4562 z0/z1 conditional breakpoints extension 4563 4564 The z0/z1 breakpoint insertion packets have been extended to carry 4565 a list of conditional expressions over to the remote stub depending on the 4566 condition evaluation mode. The use of this extension can be controlled 4567 via the \\"set remote conditional-breakpoints-packet\\" command. 4568 4569 QProgramSignals: 4570 4571 Specify the signals which the remote stub may pass to the debugged 4572 program without GDB involvement. 4573 4574 * New command line options 4575 4576 --init-command=FILE, -ix Like --command, -x but execute it 4577 before loading inferior. 4578 --init-eval-command=COMMAND, -iex Like --eval-command=COMMAND, -ex but 4579 execute it before loading inferior. 4580 4581 *** Changes in GDB 7.4 4582 4583 * GDB now handles ambiguous linespecs more consistently; the existing 4584 FILE:LINE support has been expanded to other types of linespecs. A 4585 breakpoint will now be set on all matching locations in all 4586 inferiors, and locations will be added or removed according to 4587 inferior changes. 4588 4589 * GDB now allows you to skip uninteresting functions and files when 4590 stepping with the \\"skip function\\" and \\"skip file\\" commands. 4591 4592 * GDB has two new commands: \\"set remote hardware-watchpoint-length-limit\\" 4593 and \\"show remote hardware-watchpoint-length-limit\\". These allows to 4594 set or show the maximum length limit (in bytes) of a remote 4595 target hardware watchpoint. 4596 4597 This allows e.g. to use \\"unlimited\\" hardware watchpoints with the 4598 gdbserver integrated in Valgrind version >= 3.7.0. Such Valgrind 4599 watchpoints are slower than real hardware watchpoints but are 4600 significantly faster than gdb software watchpoints. 4601 4602 * Python scripting 4603 4604 ** The register_pretty_printer function in module gdb.printing now takes 4605 an optional \`replace' argument. If True, the new printer replaces any 4606 existing one. 4607 4608 ** The \\"maint set python print-stack on|off\\" command has been 4609 deprecated and will be deleted in GDB 7.5. 4610 A new command: \\"set python print-stack none|full|message\\" has 4611 replaced it. Additionally, the default for \\"print-stack\\" is 4612 now \\"message\\", which just prints the error message without 4613 the stack trace. 4614 4615 ** A prompt substitution hook (prompt_hook) is now available to the 4616 Python API. 4617 4618 ** A new Python module, gdb.prompt has been added to the GDB Python 4619 modules library. This module provides functionality for 4620 escape sequences in prompts (used by set/show 4621 extended-prompt). These escape sequences are replaced by their 4622 corresponding value. 4623 4624 ** Python commands and convenience-functions located in 4625 'data-directory'/python/gdb/command and 4626 'data-directory'/python/gdb/function are now automatically loaded 4627 on GDB start-up. 4628 4629 ** Blocks now provide four new attributes. global_block and 4630 static_block will return the global and static blocks 4631 respectively. is_static and is_global are boolean attributes 4632 that indicate if the block is one of those two types. 4633 4634 ** Symbols now provide the \\"type\\" attribute, the type of the symbol. 4635 4636 ** The \\"gdb.breakpoint\\" function has been deprecated in favor of 4637 \\"gdb.breakpoints\\". 4638 4639 ** A new class \\"gdb.FinishBreakpoint\\" is provided to catch the return 4640 of a function. This class is based on the \\"finish\\" command 4641 available in the CLI. 4642 4643 ** Type objects for struct and union types now allow access to 4644 the fields using standard Python dictionary (mapping) methods. 4645 For example, \\"some_type['myfield']\\" now works, as does 4646 \\"some_type.items()\\". 4647 4648 ** A new event \\"gdb.new_objfile\\" has been added, triggered by loading a 4649 new object file. 4650 4651 ** A new function, \\"deep_items\\" has been added to the gdb.types 4652 module in the GDB Python modules library. This function returns 4653 an iterator over the fields of a struct or union type. Unlike 4654 the standard Python \\"iteritems\\" method, it will recursively traverse 4655 any anonymous fields. 4656 4657 * MI changes 4658 4659 ** \\"*stopped\\" events can report several new \\"reason\\"s, such as 4660 \\"solib-event\\". 4661 4662 ** Breakpoint changes are now notified using new async records, like 4663 \\"=breakpoint-modified\\". 4664 4665 ** New command -ada-task-info. 4666 4667 * libthread-db-search-path now supports two special values: sdir and pdir. 4668 sdir specifies the default system locations of shared libraries. 4669 pdir specifies the directory where the libpthread used by the application 4670 lives. 4671 4672 GDB no longer looks in sdir and pdir after it has searched the directories 4673 mentioned in libthread-db-search-path. If you want to search those 4674 directories, they must be specified in libthread-db-search-path. 4675 The default value of libthread-db-search-path on GNU/Linux and Solaris 4676 systems is now \\"sdir:pdir\\". 4677 4678 pdir is not supported by gdbserver, it is currently ignored. 4679 sdir is supported by gdbserver. 4680 4681 * New configure option --with-iconv-bin. 4682 When using the internationalization support like the one in the GNU C 4683 library, GDB will invoke the \\"iconv\\" program to get a list of supported 4684 character sets. If this program lives in a non-standard location, one can 4685 use this option to specify where to find it. 4686 4687 * When natively debugging programs on PowerPC BookE processors running 4688 a Linux kernel version 2.6.34 or later, GDB supports masked hardware 4689 watchpoints, which specify a mask in addition to an address to watch. 4690 The mask specifies that some bits of an address (the bits which are 4691 reset in the mask) should be ignored when matching the address accessed 4692 by the inferior against the watchpoint address. See the \\"PowerPC Embedded\\" 4693 section in the user manual for more details. 4694 4695 * The new option --once causes GDBserver to stop listening for connections once 4696 the first connection is made. The listening port used by GDBserver will 4697 become available after that. 4698 4699 * New commands \\"info macros\\" and \\"alias\\" have been added. 4700 4701 * New function parameters suffix @entry specifies value of function parameter 4702 at the time the function got called. Entry values are available only since 4703 gcc version 4.7. 4704 4705 * New commands 4706 4707 !SHELL COMMAND 4708 \\"!\\" is now an alias of the \\"shell\\" command. 4709 Note that no space is needed between \\"!\\" and SHELL COMMAND. 4710 4711 * Changed commands 4712 4713 watch EXPRESSION mask MASK_VALUE 4714 The watch command now supports the mask argument which allows creation 4715 of masked watchpoints, if the current architecture supports this feature. 4716 4717 info auto-load-scripts [REGEXP] 4718 This command was formerly named \\"maintenance print section-scripts\\". 4719 It is now generally useful and is no longer a maintenance-only command. 4720 4721 info macro [-all] [--] MACRO 4722 The info macro command has new options \`-all' and \`--'. The first for 4723 printing all definitions of a macro. The second for explicitly specifying 4724 the end of arguments and the beginning of the macro name in case the macro 4725 name starts with a hyphen. 4726 4727 collect[/s] EXPRESSIONS 4728 The tracepoint collect command now takes an optional modifier \\"/s\\" 4729 that directs it to dereference pointer-to-character types and 4730 collect the bytes of memory up to a zero byte. The behavior is 4731 similar to what you see when you use the regular print command on a 4732 string. An optional integer following the \\"/s\\" sets a bound on the 4733 number of bytes that will be collected. 4734 4735 tstart [NOTES] 4736 The trace start command now interprets any supplied arguments as a 4737 note to be recorded with the trace run, with an effect similar to 4738 setting the variable trace-notes. 4739 4740 tstop [NOTES] 4741 The trace stop command now interprets any arguments as a note to be 4742 mentioned along with the tstatus report that the trace was stopped 4743 with a command. The effect is similar to setting the variable 4744 trace-stop-notes. 4745 4746 * Tracepoints can now be enabled and disabled at any time after a trace 4747 experiment has been started using the standard \\"enable\\" and \\"disable\\" 4748 commands. It is now possible to start a trace experiment with no enabled 4749 tracepoints; GDB will display a warning, but will allow the experiment to 4750 begin, assuming that tracepoints will be enabled as needed while the trace 4751 is running. 4752 4753 * Fast tracepoints on 32-bit x86-architectures can now be placed at 4754 locations with 4-byte instructions, when they were previously 4755 limited to locations with instructions of 5 bytes or longer. 4756 4757 * New options 4758 4759 set debug dwarf2-read 4760 show debug dwarf2-read 4761 Turns on or off display of debugging messages related to reading 4762 DWARF debug info. The default is off. 4763 4764 set debug symtab-create 4765 show debug symtab-create 4766 Turns on or off display of debugging messages related to symbol table 4767 creation. The default is off. 4768 4769 set extended-prompt 4770 show extended-prompt 4771 Set the GDB prompt, and allow escape sequences to be inserted to 4772 display miscellaneous information (see 'help set extended-prompt' 4773 for the list of sequences). This prompt (and any information 4774 accessed through the escape sequences) is updated every time the 4775 prompt is displayed. 4776 4777 set print entry-values (both|compact|default|if-needed|no|only|preferred) 4778 show print entry-values 4779 Set printing of frame argument values at function entry. In some cases 4780 GDB can determine the value of function argument which was passed by the 4781 function caller, even if the value was modified inside the called function. 4782 4783 set debug entry-values 4784 show debug entry-values 4785 Control display of debugging info for determining frame argument values at 4786 function entry and virtual tail call frames. 4787 4788 set basenames-may-differ 4789 show basenames-may-differ 4790 Set whether a source file may have multiple base names. 4791 (A \\"base name\\" is the name of a file with the directory part removed. 4792 Example: The base name of \\"/home/user/hello.c\\" is \\"hello.c\\".) 4793 If set, GDB will canonicalize file names (e.g., expand symlinks) 4794 before comparing them. Canonicalization is an expensive operation, 4795 but it allows the same file be known by more than one base name. 4796 If not set (the default), all source files are assumed to have just 4797 one base name, and gdb will do file name comparisons more efficiently. 4798 4799 set trace-user 4800 show trace-user 4801 set trace-notes 4802 show trace-notes 4803 Set a user name and notes for the current and any future trace runs. 4804 This is useful for long-running and/or disconnected traces, to 4805 inform others (or yourself) as to who is running the trace, supply 4806 contact information, or otherwise explain what is going on. 4807 4808 set trace-stop-notes 4809 show trace-stop-notes 4810 Set a note attached to the trace run, that is displayed when the 4811 trace has been stopped by a tstop command. This is useful for 4812 instance as an explanation, if you are stopping a trace run that was 4813 started by someone else. 4814 4815 * New remote packets 4816 4817 QTEnable 4818 4819 Dynamically enable a tracepoint in a started trace experiment. 4820 4821 QTDisable 4822 4823 Dynamically disable a tracepoint in a started trace experiment. 4824 4825 QTNotes 4826 4827 Set the user and notes of the trace run. 4828 4829 qTP 4830 4831 Query the current status of a tracepoint. 4832 4833 qTMinFTPILen 4834 4835 Query the minimum length of instruction at which a fast tracepoint may 4836 be placed. 4837 4838 * Dcache size (number of lines) and line-size are now runtime-configurable 4839 via \\"set dcache line\\" and \\"set dcache line-size\\" commands. 4840 4841 * New targets 4842 4843 Texas Instruments TMS320C6x tic6x-*-* 4844 4845 * New Simulators 4846 4847 Renesas RL78 rl78-*-elf 4848 4849 *** Changes in GDB 7.3.1 4850 4851 * The build failure for NetBSD and OpenBSD targets have now been fixed. 4852 4853 *** Changes in GDB 7.3 4854 4855 * GDB has a new command: \\"thread find [REGEXP]\\". 4856 It finds the thread id whose name, target id, or thread extra info 4857 matches the given regular expression. 4858 4859 * The \\"catch syscall\\" command now works on mips*-linux* targets. 4860 4861 * The -data-disassemble MI command now supports modes 2 and 3 for 4862 dumping the instruction opcodes. 4863 4864 * New command line options 4865 4866 -data-directory DIR Specify DIR as the \\"data-directory\\". 4867 This is mostly for testing purposes. 4868 4869 * The \\"maint set python auto-load on|off\\" command has been renamed to 4870 \\"set auto-load-scripts on|off\\". 4871 4872 * GDB has a new command: \\"set directories\\". 4873 It is like the \\"dir\\" command except that it replaces the 4874 source path list instead of augmenting it. 4875 4876 * GDB now understands thread names. 4877 4878 On GNU/Linux, \\"info threads\\" will display the thread name as set by 4879 prctl or pthread_setname_np. 4880 4881 There is also a new command, \\"thread name\\", which can be used to 4882 assign a name internally for GDB to display. 4883 4884 * OpenCL C 4885 Initial support for the OpenCL C language (http://www.khronos.org/opencl) 4886 has been integrated into GDB. 4887 4888 * Python scripting 4889 4890 ** The function gdb.Write now accepts an optional keyword 'stream'. 4891 This keyword, when provided, will direct the output to either 4892 stdout, stderr, or GDB's logging output. 4893 4894 ** Parameters can now be be sub-classed in Python, and in particular 4895 you may implement the get_set_doc and get_show_doc functions. 4896 This improves how Parameter set/show documentation is processed 4897 and allows for more dynamic content. 4898 4899 ** Symbols, Symbol Table, Symbol Table and Line, Object Files, 4900 Inferior, Inferior Thread, Blocks, and Block Iterator APIs now 4901 have an is_valid method. 4902 4903 ** Breakpoints can now be sub-classed in Python, and in particular 4904 you may implement a 'stop' function that is executed each time 4905 the inferior reaches that breakpoint. 4906 4907 ** New function gdb.lookup_global_symbol looks up a global symbol. 4908 4909 ** GDB values in Python are now callable if the value represents a 4910 function. For example, if 'some_value' represents a function that 4911 takes two integer parameters and returns a value, you can call 4912 that function like so: 4913 4914 result = some_value (10,20) 4915 4916 ** Module gdb.types has been added. 4917 It contains a collection of utilities for working with gdb.Types objects: 4918 get_basic_type, has_field, make_enum_dict. 4919 4920 ** Module gdb.printing has been added. 4921 It contains utilities for writing and registering pretty-printers. 4922 New classes: PrettyPrinter, SubPrettyPrinter, 4923 RegexpCollectionPrettyPrinter. 4924 New function: register_pretty_printer. 4925 4926 ** New commands \\"info pretty-printers\\", \\"enable pretty-printer\\" and 4927 \\"disable pretty-printer\\" have been added. 4928 4929 ** gdb.parameter(\\"directories\\") is now available. 4930 4931 ** New function gdb.newest_frame returns the newest frame in the 4932 selected thread. 4933 4934 ** The gdb.InferiorThread class has a new \\"name\\" attribute. This 4935 holds the thread's name. 4936 4937 ** Python Support for Inferior events. 4938 Python scripts can add observers to be notified of events 4939 occurring in the process being debugged. 4940 The following events are currently supported: 4941 - gdb.events.cont Continue event. 4942 - gdb.events.exited Inferior exited event. 4943 - gdb.events.stop Signal received, and Breakpoint hit events. 4944 4945 * C++ Improvements: 4946 4947 ** GDB now puts template parameters in scope when debugging in an 4948 instantiation. For example, if you have: 4949 4950 template<int X> int func (void) { return X; } 4951 4952 then if you step into func<5>, \\"print X\\" will show \\"5\\". This 4953 feature requires proper debuginfo support from the compiler; it 4954 was added to GCC 4.5. 4955 4956 ** The motion commands \\"next\\", \\"finish\\", \\"until\\", and \\"advance\\" now 4957 work better when exceptions are thrown. In particular, GDB will 4958 no longer lose control of the inferior; instead, the GDB will 4959 stop the inferior at the point at which the exception is caught. 4960 This functionality requires a change in the exception handling 4961 code that was introduced in GCC 4.5. 4962 4963 * GDB now follows GCC's rules on accessing volatile objects when 4964 reading or writing target state during expression evaluation. 4965 One notable difference to prior behavior is that \\"print x = 0\\" 4966 no longer generates a read of x; the value of the assignment is 4967 now always taken directly from the value being assigned. 4968 4969 * GDB now has some support for using labels in the program's source in 4970 linespecs. For instance, you can use \\"advance label\\" to continue 4971 execution to a label. 4972 4973 * GDB now has support for reading and writing a new .gdb_index 4974 section. This section holds a fast index of DWARF debugging 4975 information and can be used to greatly speed up GDB startup and 4976 operation. See the documentation for \`save gdb-index' for details. 4977 4978 * The \\"watch\\" command now accepts an optional \\"-location\\" argument. 4979 When used, this causes GDB to watch the memory referred to by the 4980 expression. Such a watchpoint is never deleted due to it going out 4981 of scope. 4982 4983 * GDB now supports thread debugging of core dumps on GNU/Linux. 4984 4985 GDB now activates thread debugging using the libthread_db library 4986 when debugging GNU/Linux core dumps, similarly to when debugging 4987 live processes. As a result, when debugging a core dump file, GDB 4988 is now able to display pthread_t ids of threads. For example, \\"info 4989 threads\\" shows the same output as when debugging the process when it 4990 was live. In earlier releases, you'd see something like this: 4991 4992 (gdb) info threads 4993 * 1 LWP 6780 main () at main.c:10 4994 4995 While now you see this: 4996 4997 (gdb) info threads 4998 * 1 Thread 0x7f0f5712a700 (LWP 6780) main () at main.c:10 4999 5000 It is also now possible to inspect TLS variables when debugging core 5001 dumps. 5002 5003 When debugging a core dump generated on a machine other than the one 5004 used to run GDB, you may need to point GDB at the correct 5005 libthread_db library with the \\"set libthread-db-search-path\\" 5006 command. See the user manual for more details on this command. 5007 5008 * When natively debugging programs on PowerPC BookE processors running 5009 a Linux kernel version 2.6.34 or later, GDB supports ranged breakpoints, 5010 which stop execution of the inferior whenever it executes an instruction 5011 at any address within the specified range. See the \\"PowerPC Embedded\\" 5012 section in the user manual for more details. 5013 5014 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 5015 5016 ** GDBserver is now supported on PowerPC LynxOS (versions 4.x and 5.x), 5017 and i686 LynxOS (version 5.x). 5018 5019 ** GDBserver is now supported on Blackfin Linux. 5020 5021 * New native configurations 5022 5023 ia64 HP-UX ia64-*-hpux* 5024 5025 * New targets: 5026 5027 Analog Devices, Inc. Blackfin Processor bfin-* 5028 5029 * Ada task switching is now supported on sparc-elf targets when 5030 debugging a program using the Ravenscar Profile. For more information, 5031 see the \\"Tasking Support when using the Ravenscar Profile\\" section 5032 in the GDB user manual. 5033 5034 * Guile support was removed. 5035 5036 * New features in the GNU simulator 5037 5038 ** The --map-info flag lists all known core mappings. 5039 5040 ** CFI flashes may be simulated via the \\"cfi\\" device. 5041 5042 *** Changes in GDB 7.2 5043 5044 * Shared library support for remote targets by default 5045 5046 When GDB is configured for a generic, non-OS specific target, like 5047 for example, --target=arm-eabi or one of the many *-*-elf targets, 5048 GDB now queries remote stubs for loaded shared libraries using the 5049 \`qXfer:libraries:read' packet. Previously, shared library support 5050 was always disabled for such configurations. 5051 5052 * C++ Improvements: 5053 5054 ** Argument Dependent Lookup (ADL) 5055 5056 In C++ ADL lookup directs function search to the namespaces of its 5057 arguments even if the namespace has not been imported. 5058 For example: 5059 namespace A 5060 { 5061 class B { }; 5062 void foo (B) { } 5063 } 5064 ... 5065 A::B b 5066 foo(b) 5067 Here the compiler will search for \`foo' in the namespace of 'b' 5068 and find A::foo. GDB now supports this. This construct is commonly 5069 used in the Standard Template Library for operators. 5070 5071 ** Improved User Defined Operator Support 5072 5073 In addition to member operators, GDB now supports lookup of operators 5074 defined in a namespace and imported with a \`using' directive, operators 5075 defined in the global scope, operators imported implicitly from an 5076 anonymous namespace, and the ADL operators mentioned in the previous 5077 entry. 5078 GDB now also supports proper overload resolution for all the previously 5079 mentioned flavors of operators. 5080 5081 ** static const class members 5082 5083 Printing of static const class members that are initialized in the 5084 class definition has been fixed. 5085 5086 * Windows Thread Information Block access. 5087 5088 On Windows targets, GDB now supports displaying the Windows Thread 5089 Information Block (TIB) structure. This structure is visible either 5090 by using the new command \`info w32 thread-information-block' or, by 5091 dereferencing the new convenience variable named \`_tlb', a 5092 thread-specific pointer to the TIB. This feature is also supported 5093 when remote debugging using GDBserver. 5094 5095 * Static tracepoints 5096 5097 Static tracepoints are calls in the user program into a tracing 5098 library. One such library is a port of the LTTng kernel tracer to 5099 userspace --- UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer, http://lttng.org/ust). 5100 When debugging with GDBserver, GDB now supports combining the GDB 5101 tracepoint machinery with such libraries. For example: the user can 5102 use GDB to probe a static tracepoint marker (a call from the user 5103 program into the tracing library) with the new \\"strace\\" command (see 5104 \\"New commands\\" below). This creates a \\"static tracepoint\\" in the 5105 breakpoint list, that can be manipulated with the same feature set 5106 as fast and regular tracepoints. E.g., collect registers, local and 5107 global variables, collect trace state variables, and define 5108 tracepoint conditions. In addition, the user can collect extra 5109 static tracepoint marker specific data, by collecting the new 5110 _sdata internal variable. When analyzing the trace buffer, you can 5111 inspect _sdata like any other variable available to GDB. For more 5112 information, see the \\"Tracepoints\\" chapter in GDB user manual. New 5113 remote packets have been defined to support static tracepoints, see 5114 the \\"New remote packets\\" section below. 5115 5116 * Better reconstruction of tracepoints after disconnected tracing 5117 5118 GDB will attempt to download the original source form of tracepoint 5119 definitions when starting a trace run, and then will upload these 5120 upon reconnection to the target, resulting in a more accurate 5121 reconstruction of the tracepoints that are in use on the target. 5122 5123 * Observer mode 5124 5125 You can now exercise direct control over the ways that GDB can 5126 affect your program. For instance, you can disallow the setting of 5127 breakpoints, so that the program can run continuously (assuming 5128 non-stop mode). In addition, the \\"observer\\" variable is available 5129 to switch all of the different controls; in observer mode, GDB 5130 cannot affect the target's behavior at all, which is useful for 5131 tasks like diagnosing live systems in the field. 5132 5133 * The new convenience variable _thread holds the number of the 5134 current thread. 5135 5136 * New remote packets 5137 5138 qGetTIBAddr 5139 5140 Return the address of the Windows Thread Information Block of a given thread. 5141 5142 qRelocInsn 5143 5144 In response to several of the tracepoint packets, the target may now 5145 also respond with a number of intermediate \`qRelocInsn' request 5146 packets before the final result packet, to have GDB handle 5147 relocating an instruction to execute at a different address. This 5148 is particularly useful for stubs that support fast tracepoints. GDB 5149 reports support for this feature in the qSupported packet. 5150 5151 qTfSTM, qTsSTM 5152 5153 List static tracepoint markers in the target program. 5154 5155 qTSTMat 5156 5157 List static tracepoint markers at a given address in the target 5158 program. 5159 5160 qXfer:statictrace:read 5161 5162 Read the static trace data collected (by a \`collect _sdata' 5163 tracepoint action). The remote stub reports support for this packet 5164 to gdb's qSupported query. 5165 5166 QAllow 5167 5168 Send the current settings of GDB's permission flags. 5169 5170 QTDPsrc 5171 5172 Send part of the source (textual) form of a tracepoint definition, 5173 which includes location, conditional, and action list. 5174 5175 * The source command now accepts a -s option to force searching for the 5176 script in the source search path even if the script name specifies 5177 a directory. 5178 5179 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 5180 5181 - GDBserver now support tracepoints (including fast tracepoints, and 5182 static tracepoints). The feature is currently supported by the 5183 i386-linux and amd64-linux builds. See the \\"Tracepoints support 5184 in gdbserver\\" section in the manual for more information. 5185 5186 GDBserver JIT compiles the tracepoint's conditional agent 5187 expression bytecode into native code whenever possible for low 5188 overhead dynamic tracepoints conditionals. For such tracepoints, 5189 an expression that examines program state is evaluated when the 5190 tracepoint is reached, in order to determine whether to capture 5191 trace data. If the condition is simple and false, processing the 5192 tracepoint finishes very quickly and no data is gathered. 5193 5194 GDBserver interfaces with the UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer) library 5195 for static tracepoints support. 5196 5197 - GDBserver now supports x86_64 Windows 64-bit debugging. 5198 5199 * GDB now sends xmlRegisters= in qSupported packet to indicate that 5200 it understands register description. 5201 5202 * The --batch flag now disables pagination and queries. 5203 5204 * X86 general purpose registers 5205 5206 GDB now supports reading/writing byte, word and double-word x86 5207 general purpose registers directly. This means you can use, say, 5208 ah or ax to refer, respectively, to the byte register AH and 5209 16-bit word register AX that are actually portions of the 32-bit 5210 register EAX or 64-bit register RAX. 5211 5212 * The \`commands' command now accepts a range of breakpoints to modify. 5213 A plain \`commands' following a command that creates multiple 5214 breakpoints affects all the breakpoints set by that command. This 5215 applies to breakpoints set by \`rbreak', and also applies when a 5216 single \`break' command creates multiple breakpoints (e.g., 5217 breakpoints on overloaded c++ functions). 5218 5219 * The \`rbreak' command now accepts a filename specification as part of 5220 its argument, limiting the functions selected by the regex to those 5221 in the specified file. 5222 5223 * Support for remote debugging Windows and SymbianOS shared libraries 5224 from Unix hosts has been improved. Non Windows GDB builds now can 5225 understand target reported file names that follow MS-DOS based file 5226 system semantics, such as file names that include drive letters and 5227 use the backslash character as directory separator. This makes it 5228 possible to transparently use the \\"set sysroot\\" and \\"set 5229 solib-search-path\\" on Unix hosts to point as host copies of the 5230 target's shared libraries. See the new command \\"set 5231 target-file-system-kind\\" described below, and the \\"Commands to 5232 specify files\\" section in the user manual for more information. 5233 5234 * New commands 5235 5236 eval template, expressions... 5237 Convert the values of one or more expressions under the control 5238 of the string template to a command line, and call it. 5239 5240 set target-file-system-kind unix|dos-based|auto 5241 show target-file-system-kind 5242 Set or show the assumed file system kind for target reported file 5243 names. 5244 5245 save breakpoints <filename> 5246 Save all current breakpoint definitions to a file suitable for use 5247 in a later debugging session. To read the saved breakpoint 5248 definitions, use the \`source' command. 5249 5250 \`save tracepoints' is a new alias for \`save-tracepoints'. The latter 5251 is now deprecated. 5252 5253 info static-tracepoint-markers 5254 Display information about static tracepoint markers in the target. 5255 5256 strace FN | FILE:LINE | *ADDR | -m MARKER_ID 5257 Define a static tracepoint by probing a marker at the given 5258 function, line, address, or marker ID. 5259 5260 set observer on|off 5261 show observer 5262 Enable and disable observer mode. 5263 5264 set may-write-registers on|off 5265 set may-write-memory on|off 5266 set may-insert-breakpoints on|off 5267 set may-insert-tracepoints on|off 5268 set may-insert-fast-tracepoints on|off 5269 set may-interrupt on|off 5270 Set individual permissions for GDB effects on the target. Note that 5271 some of these settings can have undesirable or surprising 5272 consequences, particularly when changed in the middle of a session. 5273 For instance, disabling the writing of memory can prevent 5274 breakpoints from being inserted, cause single-stepping to fail, or 5275 even crash your program, if you disable after breakpoints have been 5276 inserted. However, GDB should not crash. 5277 5278 set record memory-query on|off 5279 show record memory-query 5280 Control whether to stop the inferior if memory changes caused 5281 by an instruction cannot be recorded. 5282 5283 * Changed commands 5284 5285 disassemble 5286 The disassemble command now supports \\"start,+length\\" form of two arguments. 5287 5288 * Python scripting 5289 5290 ** GDB now provides a new directory location, called the python directory, 5291 where Python scripts written for GDB can be installed. The location 5292 of that directory is <data-directory>/python, where <data-directory> 5293 is the GDB data directory. For more details, see section \`Scripting 5294 GDB using Python' in the manual. 5295 5296 ** The GDB Python API now has access to breakpoints, symbols, symbol 5297 tables, program spaces, inferiors, threads and frame's code blocks. 5298 Additionally, GDB Parameters can now be created from the API, and 5299 manipulated via set/show in the CLI. 5300 5301 ** New functions gdb.target_charset, gdb.target_wide_charset, 5302 gdb.progspaces, gdb.current_progspace, and gdb.string_to_argv. 5303 5304 ** New exception gdb.GdbError. 5305 5306 ** Pretty-printers are now also looked up in the current program space. 5307 5308 ** Pretty-printers can now be individually enabled and disabled. 5309 5310 ** GDB now looks for names of Python scripts to auto-load in a 5311 special section named \`.debug_gdb_scripts', in addition to looking 5312 for a OBJFILE-gdb.py script when OBJFILE is read by the debugger. 5313 5314 * Tracepoint actions were unified with breakpoint commands. In particular, 5315 there are no longer differences in \\"info break\\" output for breakpoints and 5316 tracepoints and the \\"commands\\" command can be used for both tracepoints and 5317 regular breakpoints. 5318 5319 * New targets 5320 5321 ARM Symbian arm*-*-symbianelf* 5322 5323 * D language support. 5324 GDB now supports debugging programs written in the D programming 5325 language. 5326 5327 * GDB now supports the extended ptrace interface for PowerPC which is 5328 available since Linux kernel version 2.6.34. This automatically enables 5329 any hardware breakpoints and additional hardware watchpoints available in 5330 the processor. The old ptrace interface exposes just one hardware 5331 watchpoint and no hardware breakpoints. 5332 5333 * GDB is now able to use the Data Value Compare (DVC) register available on 5334 embedded PowerPC processors to implement in hardware simple watchpoint 5335 conditions of the form: 5336 5337 watch ADDRESS|VARIABLE if ADDRESS|VARIABLE == CONSTANT EXPRESSION 5338 5339 This works in native GDB running on Linux kernels with the extended ptrace 5340 interface mentioned above. 5341 5342 *** Changes in GDB 7.1 5343 5344 * C++ Improvements 5345 5346 ** Namespace Support 5347 5348 GDB now supports importing of namespaces in C++. This enables the 5349 user to inspect variables from imported namespaces. Support for 5350 namepace aliasing has also been added. So, if a namespace is 5351 aliased in the current scope (e.g. namepace C=A; ) the user can 5352 print variables using the alias (e.g. (gdb) print C::x). 5353 5354 ** Bug Fixes 5355 5356 All known bugs relating to the printing of virtual base class were 5357 fixed. It is now possible to call overloaded static methods using a 5358 qualified name. 5359 5360 ** Cast Operators 5361 5362 The C++ cast operators static_cast<>, dynamic_cast<>, const_cast<>, 5363 and reinterpret_cast<> are now handled by the C++ expression parser. 5364 5365 * New targets 5366 5367 Xilinx MicroBlaze microblaze-*-* 5368 Renesas RX rx-*-elf 5369 5370 * New Simulators 5371 5372 Xilinx MicroBlaze microblaze 5373 Renesas RX rx 5374 5375 * Multi-program debugging. 5376 5377 GDB now has support for multi-program (a.k.a. multi-executable or 5378 multi-exec) debugging. This allows for debugging multiple inferiors 5379 simultaneously each running a different program under the same GDB 5380 session. See \\"Debugging Multiple Inferiors and Programs\\" in the 5381 manual for more information. This implied some user visible changes 5382 in the multi-inferior support. For example, \\"info inferiors\\" now 5383 lists inferiors that are not running yet or that have exited 5384 already. See also \\"New commands\\" and \\"New options\\" below. 5385 5386 * New tracing features 5387 5388 GDB's tracepoint facility now includes several new features: 5389 5390 ** Trace state variables 5391 5392 GDB tracepoints now include support for trace state variables, which 5393 are variables managed by the target agent during a tracing 5394 experiment. They are useful for tracepoints that trigger each 5395 other, so for instance one tracepoint can count hits in a variable, 5396 and then a second tracepoint has a condition that is true when the 5397 count reaches a particular value. Trace state variables share the 5398 -syntax of GDB convenience variables, and can appear in both 5399 tracepoint actions and condition expressions. Use the \\"tvariable\\" 5400 command to create, and \\"info tvariables\\" to view; see \\"Trace State 5401 Variables\\" in the manual for more detail. 5402 5403 ** Fast tracepoints 5404 5405 GDB now includes an option for defining fast tracepoints, which 5406 targets may implement more efficiently, such as by installing a jump 5407 into the target agent rather than a trap instruction. The resulting 5408 speedup can be by two orders of magnitude or more, although the 5409 tradeoff is that some program locations on some target architectures 5410 might not allow fast tracepoint installation, for instance if the 5411 instruction to be replaced is shorter than the jump. To request a 5412 fast tracepoint, use the \\"ftrace\\" command, with syntax identical to 5413 the regular trace command. 5414 5415 ** Disconnected tracing 5416 5417 It is now possible to detach GDB from the target while it is running 5418 a trace experiment, then reconnect later to see how the experiment 5419 is going. In addition, a new variable disconnected-tracing lets you 5420 tell the target agent whether to continue running a trace if the 5421 connection is lost unexpectedly. 5422 5423 ** Trace files 5424 5425 GDB now has the ability to save the trace buffer into a file, and 5426 then use that file as a target, similarly to you can do with 5427 corefiles. You can select trace frames, print data that was 5428 collected in them, and use tstatus to display the state of the 5429 tracing run at the moment that it was saved. To create a trace 5430 file, use \\"tsave <filename>\\", and to use it, do \\"target tfile 5431 <name>\\". 5432 5433 ** Circular trace buffer 5434 5435 You can ask the target agent to handle the trace buffer as a 5436 circular buffer, discarding the oldest trace frames to make room for 5437 newer ones, by setting circular-trace-buffer to on. This feature may 5438 not be available for all target agents. 5439 5440 * Changed commands 5441 5442 disassemble 5443 The disassemble command, when invoked with two arguments, now requires 5444 the arguments to be comma-separated. 5445 5446 info variables 5447 The info variables command now displays variable definitions. Files 5448 which only declare a variable are not shown. 5449 5450 source 5451 The source command is now capable of sourcing Python scripts. 5452 This feature is dependent on the debugger being build with Python 5453 support. 5454 5455 Related to this enhancement is also the introduction of a new command 5456 \\"set script-extension\\" (see below). 5457 5458 * New commands (for set/show, see \\"New options\\" below) 5459 5460 record save [<FILENAME>] 5461 Save a file (in core file format) containing the process record 5462 execution log for replay debugging at a later time. 5463 5464 record restore <FILENAME> 5465 Restore the process record execution log that was saved at an 5466 earlier time, for replay debugging. 5467 5468 add-inferior [-copies <N>] [-exec <FILENAME>] 5469 Add a new inferior. 5470 5471 clone-inferior [-copies <N>] [ID] 5472 Make a new inferior ready to execute the same program another 5473 inferior has loaded. 5474 5475 remove-inferior ID 5476 Remove an inferior. 5477 5478 maint info program-spaces 5479 List the program spaces loaded into GDB. 5480 5481 set remote interrupt-sequence [Ctrl-C | BREAK | BREAK-g] 5482 show remote interrupt-sequence 5483 Allow the user to select one of ^C, a BREAK signal or BREAK-g 5484 as the sequence to the remote target in order to interrupt the execution. 5485 Ctrl-C is a default. Some system prefers BREAK which is high level of 5486 serial line for some certain time. Linux kernel prefers BREAK-g, a.k.a 5487 Magic SysRq g. It is BREAK signal and character 'g'. 5488 5489 set remote interrupt-on-connect [on | off] 5490 show remote interrupt-on-connect 5491 When interrupt-on-connect is ON, gdb sends interrupt-sequence to 5492 remote target when gdb connects to it. This is needed when you debug 5493 Linux kernel. 5494 5495 set remotebreak [on | off] 5496 show remotebreak 5497 Deprecated. Use \\"set/show remote interrupt-sequence\\" instead. 5498 5499 tvariable NAME [ = EXP ] 5500 Create or modify a trace state variable. 5501 5502 info tvariables 5503 List trace state variables and their values. 5504 5505 delete tvariable NAME ... 5506 Delete one or more trace state variables. 5507 5508 teval EXPR, ... 5509 Evaluate the given expressions without collecting anything into the 5510 trace buffer. (Valid in tracepoint actions only.) 5511 5512 ftrace FN / FILE:LINE / *ADDR 5513 Define a fast tracepoint at the given function, line, or address. 5514 5515 * New expression syntax 5516 5517 GDB now parses the 0b prefix of binary numbers the same way as GCC does. 5518 GDB now parses 0b101010 identically with 42. 5519 5520 * New options 5521 5522 set follow-exec-mode new|same 5523 show follow-exec-mode 5524 Control whether GDB reuses the same inferior across an exec call or 5525 creates a new one. This is useful to be able to restart the old 5526 executable after the inferior having done an exec call. 5527 5528 set default-collect EXPR, ... 5529 show default-collect 5530 Define a list of expressions to be collected at each tracepoint. 5531 This is a useful way to ensure essential items are not overlooked, 5532 such as registers or a critical global variable. 5533 5534 set disconnected-tracing 5535 show disconnected-tracing 5536 If set to 1, the target is instructed to continue tracing if it 5537 loses its connection to GDB. If 0, the target is to stop tracing 5538 upon disconnection. 5539 5540 set circular-trace-buffer 5541 show circular-trace-buffer 5542 If set to on, the target is instructed to use a circular trace buffer 5543 and discard the oldest trace frames instead of stopping the trace due 5544 to a full trace buffer. If set to off, the trace stops when the buffer 5545 fills up. Some targets may not support this. 5546 5547 set script-extension off|soft|strict 5548 show script-extension 5549 If set to \\"off\\", the debugger does not perform any script language 5550 recognition, and all sourced files are assumed to be GDB scripts. 5551 If set to \\"soft\\" (the default), files are sourced according to 5552 filename extension, falling back to GDB scripts if the first 5553 evaluation failed. 5554 If set to \\"strict\\", files are sourced according to filename extension. 5555 5556 set ada trust-PAD-over-XVS on|off 5557 show ada trust-PAD-over-XVS 5558 If off, activate a workaround against a bug in the debugging information 5559 generated by the compiler for PAD types (see gcc/exp_dbug.ads in 5560 the GCC sources for more information about the GNAT encoding and 5561 PAD types in particular). It is always safe to set this option to 5562 off, but this introduces a slight performance penalty. The default 5563 is on. 5564 5565 * Python API Improvements 5566 5567 ** GDB provides the new class gdb.LazyString. This is useful in 5568 some pretty-printing cases. The new method gdb.Value.lazy_string 5569 provides a simple way to create objects of this type. 5570 5571 ** The fields returned by gdb.Type.fields now have an 5572 \`is_base_class' attribute. 5573 5574 ** The new method gdb.Type.range returns the range of an array type. 5575 5576 ** The new method gdb.parse_and_eval can be used to parse and 5577 evaluate an expression. 5578 5579 * New remote packets 5580 5581 QTDV 5582 Define a trace state variable. 5583 5584 qTV 5585 Get the current value of a trace state variable. 5586 5587 QTDisconnected 5588 Set desired tracing behavior upon disconnection. 5589 5590 QTBuffer:circular 5591 Set the trace buffer to be linear or circular. 5592 5593 qTfP, qTsP 5594 Get data about the tracepoints currently in use. 5595 5596 * Bug fixes 5597 5598 Process record now works correctly with hardware watchpoints. 5599 5600 Multiple bug fixes have been made to the mips-irix port, making it 5601 much more reliable. In particular: 5602 - Debugging threaded applications is now possible again. Previously, 5603 GDB would hang while starting the program, or while waiting for 5604 the program to stop at a breakpoint. 5605 - Attaching to a running process no longer hangs. 5606 - An error occurring while loading a core file has been fixed. 5607 - Changing the value of the PC register now works again. This fixes 5608 problems observed when using the \\"jump\\" command, or when calling 5609 a function from GDB, or even when assigning a new value to pc. 5610 - With the \\"finish\\" and \\"return\\" commands, the return value for functions 5611 returning a small array is now correctly printed. 5612 - It is now possible to break on shared library code which gets executed 5613 during a shared library init phase (code executed while executing 5614 their .init section). Previously, the breakpoint would have no effect. 5615 - GDB is now able to backtrace through the signal handler for 5616 non-threaded programs. 5617 5618 PIE (Position Independent Executable) programs debugging is now supported. 5619 This includes debugging execution of PIC (Position Independent Code) shared 5620 libraries although for that, it should be possible to run such libraries as an 5621 executable program. 5622 5623 *** Changes in GDB 7.0 5624 5625 * GDB now has an interface for JIT compilation. Applications that 5626 dynamically generate code can create symbol files in memory and register 5627 them with GDB. For users, the feature should work transparently, and 5628 for JIT developers, the interface is documented in the GDB manual in the 5629 \\"JIT Compilation Interface\\" chapter. 5630 5631 * Tracepoints may now be conditional. The syntax is as for 5632 breakpoints; either an \\"if\\" clause appended to the \\"trace\\" command, 5633 or the \\"condition\\" command is available. GDB sends the condition to 5634 the target for evaluation using the same bytecode format as is used 5635 for tracepoint actions. 5636 5637 * The disassemble command now supports: an optional /r modifier, print the 5638 raw instructions in hex as well as in symbolic form, and an optional /m 5639 modifier to print mixed source+assembly. 5640 5641 * Process record and replay 5642 5643 In a architecture environment that supports \`\`process record and 5644 replay'', \`\`process record and replay'' target can record a log of 5645 the process execution, and replay it with both forward and reverse 5646 execute commands. 5647 5648 * Reverse debugging: GDB now has new commands reverse-continue, reverse- 5649 step, reverse-next, reverse-finish, reverse-stepi, reverse-nexti, and 5650 set execution-direction {forward|reverse}, for targets that support 5651 reverse execution. 5652 5653 * GDB now supports hardware watchpoints on MIPS/Linux systems. This 5654 feature is available with a native GDB running on kernel version 5655 2.6.28 or later. 5656 5657 * GDB now has support for multi-byte and wide character sets on the 5658 target. Strings whose character type is wchar_t, char16_t, or 5659 char32_t are now correctly printed. GDB supports wide- and unicode- 5660 literals in C, that is, L'x', L\\"string\\", u'x', u\\"string\\", U'x', and 5661 U\\"string\\" syntax. And, GDB allows the \\"%ls\\" and \\"%lc\\" formats in 5662 \`printf'. This feature requires iconv to work properly; if your 5663 system does not have a working iconv, GDB can use GNU libiconv. See 5664 the installation instructions for more information. 5665 5666 * GDB now supports automatic retrieval of shared library files from 5667 remote targets. To use this feature, specify a system root that begins 5668 with the \`remote:' prefix, either via the \`set sysroot' command or via 5669 the \`--with-sysroot' configure-time option. 5670 5671 * \\"info sharedlibrary\\" now takes an optional regex of libraries to show, 5672 and it now reports if a shared library has no debugging information. 5673 5674 * Commands \`set debug-file-directory', \`set solib-search-path' and \`set args' 5675 now complete on file names. 5676 5677 * When completing in expressions, gdb will attempt to limit 5678 completions to allowable structure or union fields, where appropriate. 5679 For instance, consider: 5680 5681 # struct example { int f1; double f2; }; 5682 # struct example variable; 5683 (gdb) p variable. 5684 5685 If the user types TAB at the end of this command line, the available 5686 completions will be \\"f1\\" and \\"f2\\". 5687 5688 * Inlined functions are now supported. They show up in backtraces, and 5689 the \\"step\\", \\"next\\", and \\"finish\\" commands handle them automatically. 5690 5691 * GDB now supports the token-splicing () and stringification (#) 5692 operators when expanding macros. It also supports variable-arity 5693 macros. 5694 5695 * GDB now supports inspecting extra signal information, exported by 5696 the new _siginfo convenience variable. The feature is currently 5697 implemented on linux ARM, i386 and amd64. 5698 5699 * GDB can now display the VFP floating point registers and NEON vector 5700 registers on ARM targets. Both ARM GNU/Linux native GDB and gdbserver 5701 can provide these registers (requires Linux 2.6.30 or later). Remote 5702 and simulator targets may also provide them. 5703 5704 * New remote packets 5705 5706 qSearch:memory: 5707 Search memory for a sequence of bytes. 5708 5709 QStartNoAckMode 5710 Turn off \`+'/\`-' protocol acknowledgments to permit more efficient 5711 operation over reliable transport links. Use of this packet is 5712 controlled by the \`set remote noack-packet' command. 5713 5714 vKill 5715 Kill the process with the specified process ID. Use this in preference 5716 to \`k' when multiprocess protocol extensions are supported. 5717 5718 qXfer:osdata:read 5719 Obtains additional operating system information 5720 5721 qXfer:siginfo:read 5722 qXfer:siginfo:write 5723 Read or write additional signal information. 5724 5725 * Removed remote protocol undocumented extension 5726 5727 An undocumented extension to the remote protocol's \`S' stop reply 5728 packet that permitted the stub to pass a process id was removed. 5729 Remote servers should use the \`T' stop reply packet instead. 5730 5731 * GDB now supports multiple function calling conventions according to the 5732 DWARF-2 DW_AT_calling_convention function attribute. 5733 5734 * The SH target utilizes the aforementioned change to distinguish between gcc 5735 and Renesas calling convention. It also adds the new CLI commands 5736 \`set/show sh calling-convention'. 5737 5738 * GDB can now read compressed debug sections, as produced by GNU gold 5739 with the --compress-debug-sections=zlib flag. 5740 5741 * 64-bit core files are now supported on AIX. 5742 5743 * Thread switching is now supported on Tru64. 5744 5745 * Watchpoints can now be set on unreadable memory locations, e.g. addresses 5746 which will be allocated using malloc later in program execution. 5747 5748 * The qXfer:libraries:read remote protocol packet now allows passing a 5749 list of section offsets. 5750 5751 * On GNU/Linux, GDB can now attach to stopped processes. Several race 5752 conditions handling signals delivered during attach or thread creation 5753 have also been fixed. 5754 5755 * GDB now supports the use of DWARF boolean types for Ada's type Boolean. 5756 From the user's standpoint, all unqualified instances of True and False 5757 are treated as the standard definitions, regardless of context. 5758 5759 * GDB now parses C++ symbol and type names more flexibly. For 5760 example, given: 5761 5762 template<typename T> class C { }; 5763 C<char const *> c; 5764 5765 GDB will now correctly handle all of: 5766 5767 ptype C<char const *> 5768 ptype C<char const*> 5769 ptype C<const char *> 5770 ptype C<const char*> 5771 5772 * New features in the GDB remote stub, gdbserver 5773 5774 - The \\"--wrapper\\" command-line argument tells gdbserver to use a 5775 wrapper program to launch programs for debugging. 5776 5777 - On PowerPC and S/390 targets, it is now possible to use a single 5778 gdbserver executable to debug both 32-bit and 64-bit programs. 5779 (This requires gdbserver itself to be built as a 64-bit executable.) 5780 5781 - gdbserver uses the new noack protocol mode for TCP connections to 5782 reduce communications latency, if also supported and enabled in GDB. 5783 5784 - Support for the sparc64-linux-gnu target is now included in 5785 gdbserver. 5786 5787 - The amd64-linux build of gdbserver now supports debugging both 5788 32-bit and 64-bit programs. 5789 5790 - The i386-linux, amd64-linux, and i386-win32 builds of gdbserver 5791 now support hardware watchpoints, and will use them automatically 5792 as appropriate. 5793 5794 * Python scripting 5795 5796 GDB now has support for scripting using Python. Whether this is 5797 available is determined at configure time. 5798 5799 New GDB commands can now be written in Python. 5800 5801 * Ada tasking support 5802 5803 Ada tasks can now be inspected in GDB. The following commands have 5804 been introduced: 5805 5806 info tasks 5807 Print the list of Ada tasks. 5808 info task N 5809 Print detailed information about task number N. 5810 task 5811 Print the task number of the current task. 5812 task N 5813 Switch the context of debugging to task number N. 5814 5815 * Support for user-defined prefixed commands. The \\"define\\" command can 5816 add new commands to existing prefixes, e.g. \\"target\\". 5817 5818 * Multi-inferior, multi-process debugging. 5819 5820 GDB now has generalized support for multi-inferior debugging. See 5821 \\"Debugging Multiple Inferiors\\" in the manual for more information. 5822 Although availability still depends on target support, the command 5823 set is more uniform now. The GNU/Linux specific multi-forks support 5824 has been migrated to this new framework. This implied some user 5825 visible changes; see \\"New commands\\" and also \\"Removed commands\\" 5826 below. 5827 5828 * Target descriptions can now describe the target OS ABI. See the 5829 \\"Target Description Format\\" section in the user manual for more 5830 information. 5831 5832 * Target descriptions can now describe \\"compatible\\" architectures 5833 to indicate that the target can execute applications for a different 5834 architecture in addition to those for the main target architecture. 5835 See the \\"Target Description Format\\" section in the user manual for 5836 more information. 5837 5838 * Multi-architecture debugging. 5839 5840 GDB now includes general supports for debugging applications on 5841 hybrid systems that use more than one single processor architecture 5842 at the same time. Each such hybrid architecture still requires 5843 specific support to be added. The only hybrid architecture supported 5844 in this version of GDB is the Cell Broadband Engine. 5845 5846 * GDB now supports integrated debugging of Cell/B.E. applications that 5847 use both the PPU and SPU architectures. To enable support for hybrid 5848 Cell/B.E. debugging, you need to configure GDB to support both the 5849 powerpc-linux or powerpc64-linux and the spu-elf targets, using the 5850 --enable-targets configure option. 5851 5852 * Non-stop mode debugging. 5853 5854 For some targets, GDB now supports an optional mode of operation in 5855 which you can examine stopped threads while other threads continue 5856 to execute freely. This is referred to as non-stop mode, with the 5857 old mode referred to as all-stop mode. See the \\"Non-Stop Mode\\" 5858 section in the user manual for more information. 5859 5860 To be able to support remote non-stop debugging, a remote stub needs 5861 to implement the non-stop mode remote protocol extensions, as 5862 described in the \\"Remote Non-Stop\\" section of the user manual. The 5863 GDB remote stub, gdbserver, has been adjusted to support these 5864 extensions on linux targets. 5865 5866 * New commands (for set/show, see \\"New options\\" below) 5867 5868 catch syscall [NAME(S) | NUMBER(S)] 5869 Catch system calls. Arguments, which should be names of system 5870 calls or their numbers, mean catch only those syscalls. Without 5871 arguments, every syscall will be caught. When the inferior issues 5872 any of the specified syscalls, GDB will stop and announce the system 5873 call, both when it is called and when its call returns. This 5874 feature is currently available with a native GDB running on the 5875 Linux Kernel, under the following architectures: x86, x86_64, 5876 PowerPC and PowerPC64. 5877 5878 find [/size-char] [/max-count] start-address, end-address|+search-space-size, 5879 val1 [, val2, ...] 5880 Search memory for a sequence of bytes. 5881 5882 maint set python print-stack 5883 maint show python print-stack 5884 Show a stack trace when an error is encountered in a Python script. 5885 5886 python [CODE] 5887 Invoke CODE by passing it to the Python interpreter. 5888 5889 macro define 5890 macro list 5891 macro undef 5892 These allow macros to be defined, undefined, and listed 5893 interactively. 5894 5895 info os processes 5896 Show operating system information about processes. 5897 5898 info inferiors 5899 List the inferiors currently under GDB's control. 5900 5901 inferior NUM 5902 Switch focus to inferior number NUM. 5903 5904 detach inferior NUM 5905 Detach from inferior number NUM. 5906 5907 kill inferior NUM 5908 Kill inferior number NUM. 5909 5910 * New options 5911 5912 set spu stop-on-load 5913 show spu stop-on-load 5914 Control whether to stop for new SPE threads during Cell/B.E. debugging. 5915 5916 set spu auto-flush-cache 5917 show spu auto-flush-cache 5918 Control whether to automatically flush the software-managed cache 5919 during Cell/B.E. debugging. 5920 5921 set sh calling-convention 5922 show sh calling-convention 5923 Control the calling convention used when calling SH target functions. 5924 5925 set debug timestamp 5926 show debug timestamp 5927 Control display of timestamps with GDB debugging output. 5928 5929 set disassemble-next-line 5930 show disassemble-next-line 5931 Control display of disassembled source lines or instructions when 5932 the debuggee stops. 5933 5934 set remote noack-packet 5935 show remote noack-packet 5936 Set/show the use of remote protocol QStartNoAckMode packet. See above 5937 under \\"New remote packets.\\" 5938 5939 set remote query-attached-packet 5940 show remote query-attached-packet 5941 Control use of remote protocol \`qAttached' (query-attached) packet. 5942 5943 set remote read-siginfo-object 5944 show remote read-siginfo-object 5945 Control use of remote protocol \`qXfer:siginfo:read' (read-siginfo-object) 5946 packet. 5947 5948 set remote write-siginfo-object 5949 show remote write-siginfo-object 5950 Control use of remote protocol \`qXfer:siginfo:write' (write-siginfo-object) 5951 packet. 5952 5953 set remote reverse-continue 5954 show remote reverse-continue 5955 Control use of remote protocol 'bc' (reverse-continue) packet. 5956 5957 set remote reverse-step 5958 show remote reverse-step 5959 Control use of remote protocol 'bs' (reverse-step) packet. 5960 5961 set displaced-stepping 5962 show displaced-stepping 5963 Control displaced stepping mode. Displaced stepping is a way to 5964 single-step over breakpoints without removing them from the debuggee. 5965 Also known as \\"out-of-line single-stepping\\". 5966 5967 set debug displaced 5968 show debug displaced 5969 Control display of debugging info for displaced stepping. 5970 5971 maint set internal-error 5972 maint show internal-error 5973 Control what GDB does when an internal error is detected. 5974 5975 maint set internal-warning 5976 maint show internal-warning 5977 Control what GDB does when an internal warning is detected. 5978 5979 set exec-wrapper 5980 show exec-wrapper 5981 unset exec-wrapper 5982 Use a wrapper program to launch programs for debugging. 5983 5984 set multiple-symbols (all|ask|cancel) 5985 show multiple-symbols 5986 The value of this variable can be changed to adjust the debugger behavior 5987 when an expression or a breakpoint location contains an ambiguous symbol 5988 name (an overloaded function name, for instance). 5989 5990 set breakpoint always-inserted 5991 show breakpoint always-inserted 5992 Keep breakpoints always inserted in the target, as opposed to inserting 5993 them when resuming the target, and removing them when the target stops. 5994 This option can improve debugger performance on slow remote targets. 5995 5996 set arm fallback-mode (arm|thumb|auto) 5997 show arm fallback-mode 5998 set arm force-mode (arm|thumb|auto) 5999 show arm force-mode 6000 These commands control how ARM GDB determines whether instructions 6001 are ARM or Thumb. The default for both settings is auto, which uses 6002 the current CPSR value for instructions without symbols; previous 6003 versions of GDB behaved as if \\"set arm fallback-mode arm\\". 6004 6005 set arm unwind-secure-frames 6006 Enable unwinding from Non-secure to Secure mode on Cortex-M with 6007 Security extension. 6008 This can trigger security exceptions when unwinding exception stacks. 6009 6010 set disable-randomization 6011 show disable-randomization 6012 Standalone programs run with the virtual address space randomization enabled 6013 by default on some platforms. This option keeps the addresses stable across 6014 multiple debugging sessions. 6015 6016 set non-stop 6017 show non-stop 6018 Control whether other threads are stopped or not when some thread hits 6019 a breakpoint. 6020 6021 set target-async 6022 show target-async 6023 Requests that asynchronous execution is enabled in the target, if available. 6024 In this case, it's possible to resume target in the background, and interact 6025 with GDB while the target is running. \\"show target-async\\" displays the 6026 current state of asynchronous execution of the target. 6027 6028 set target-wide-charset 6029 show target-wide-charset 6030 The target-wide-charset is the name of the character set that GDB 6031 uses when printing characters whose type is wchar_t. 6032 6033 set tcp auto-retry (on|off) 6034 show tcp auto-retry 6035 set tcp connect-timeout 6036 show tcp connect-timeout 6037 These commands allow GDB to retry failed TCP connections to a remote stub 6038 with a specified timeout period; this is useful if the stub is launched 6039 in parallel with GDB but may not be ready to accept connections immediately. 6040 6041 set libthread-db-search-path 6042 show libthread-db-search-path 6043 Control list of directories which GDB will search for appropriate 6044 libthread_db. 6045 6046 set schedule-multiple (on|off) 6047 show schedule-multiple 6048 Allow GDB to resume all threads of all processes or only threads of 6049 the current process. 6050 6051 set stack-cache 6052 show stack-cache 6053 Use more aggressive caching for accesses to the stack. This improves 6054 performance of remote debugging (particularly backtraces) without 6055 affecting correctness. 6056 6057 set interactive-mode (on|off|auto) 6058 show interactive-mode 6059 Control whether GDB runs in interactive mode (on) or not (off). 6060 When in interactive mode, GDB waits for the user to answer all 6061 queries. Otherwise, GDB does not wait and assumes the default 6062 answer. When set to auto (the default), GDB determines which 6063 mode to use based on the stdin settings. 6064 6065 * Removed commands 6066 6067 info forks 6068 For program forks, this is replaced by the new more generic \`info 6069 inferiors' command. To list checkpoints, you can still use the 6070 \`info checkpoints' command, which was an alias for the \`info forks' 6071 command. 6072 6073 fork NUM 6074 Replaced by the new \`inferior' command. To switch between 6075 checkpoints, you can still use the \`restart' command, which was an 6076 alias for the \`fork' command. 6077 6078 process PID 6079 This is removed, since some targets don't have a notion of 6080 processes. To switch between processes, you can still use the 6081 \`inferior' command using GDB's own inferior number. 6082 6083 delete fork NUM 6084 For program forks, this is replaced by the new more generic \`kill 6085 inferior' command. To delete a checkpoint, you can still use the 6086 \`delete checkpoint' command, which was an alias for the \`delete 6087 fork' command. 6088 6089 detach fork NUM 6090 For program forks, this is replaced by the new more generic \`detach 6091 inferior' command. To detach a checkpoint, you can still use the 6092 \`detach checkpoint' command, which was an alias for the \`detach 6093 fork' command. 6094 6095 * New native configurations 6096 6097 x86/x86_64 Darwin i[34567]86-*-darwin* 6098 6099 x86_64 MinGW x86_64-*-mingw* 6100 6101 * New targets 6102 6103 Lattice Mico32 lm32-* 6104 x86 DICOS i[34567]86-*-dicos* 6105 x86_64 DICOS x86_64-*-dicos* 6106 S+core 3 score-*-* 6107 6108 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports x86 Windows CE 6109 (mingw32ce) debugging. 6110 6111 * Removed commands 6112 6113 catch load 6114 catch unload 6115 These commands were actually not implemented on any target. 6116 6117 *** Changes in GDB 6.8 6118 6119 * New native configurations 6120 6121 NetBSD/hppa hppa*-*netbsd* 6122 Xtensa GNU/Linux xtensa*-*-linux* 6123 6124 * New targets 6125 6126 NetBSD/hppa hppa*-*-netbsd* 6127 Xtensa GNU/Linux xtensa*-*-linux* 6128 6129 * Change in command line behavior -- corefiles vs. process ids. 6130 6131 When the '-p NUMBER' or '--pid NUMBER' options are used, and 6132 attaching to process NUMBER fails, GDB no longer attempts to open a 6133 core file named NUMBER. Attaching to a program using the -c option 6134 is no longer supported. Instead, use the '-p' or '--pid' options. 6135 6136 * GDB can now be built as a native debugger for debugging Windows x86 6137 (mingw32) Portable Executable (PE) programs. 6138 6139 * Pending breakpoints no longer change their number when their address 6140 is resolved. 6141 6142 * GDB now supports breakpoints with multiple locations, 6143 including breakpoints on C++ constructors, inside C++ templates, 6144 and in inlined functions. 6145 6146 * GDB's ability to debug optimized code has been improved. GDB more 6147 accurately identifies function bodies and lexical blocks that occupy 6148 more than one contiguous range of addresses. 6149 6150 * Target descriptions can now describe registers for PowerPC. 6151 6152 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports the AltiVec and SPE 6153 registers on PowerPC targets. 6154 6155 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports thread debugging on GNU/Linux 6156 targets even when the libthread_db library is not available. 6157 6158 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports the new file transfer 6159 commands (remote put, remote get, and remote delete). 6160 6161 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports run and attach in 6162 extended-remote mode. 6163 6164 * hppa*64*-*-hpux11* target broken 6165 The debugger is unable to start a program and fails with the following 6166 error: \\"Error trying to get information about dynamic linker\\". 6167 The gdb-6.7 release is also affected. 6168 6169 * GDB now supports the --enable-targets= configure option to allow 6170 building a single GDB executable that supports multiple remote 6171 target architectures. 6172 6173 * GDB now supports debugging C and C++ programs which use the 6174 Decimal Floating Point extension. In addition, the PowerPC target 6175 now has a set of pseudo-registers to inspect decimal float values 6176 stored in two consecutive float registers. 6177 6178 * The -break-insert MI command can optionally create pending 6179 breakpoints now. 6180 6181 * Improved support for debugging Ada 6182 Many improvements to the Ada language support have been made. These 6183 include: 6184 - Better support for Ada2005 interface types 6185 - Improved handling of arrays and slices in general 6186 - Better support for Taft-amendment types 6187 - The '{type} ADDRESS' expression is now allowed on the left hand-side 6188 of an assignment 6189 - Improved command completion in Ada 6190 - Several bug fixes 6191 6192 * GDB on GNU/Linux and HP/UX can now debug through \\"exec\\" of a new 6193 process. 6194 6195 * New commands 6196 6197 set print frame-arguments (all|scalars|none) 6198 show print frame-arguments 6199 The value of this variable can be changed to control which argument 6200 values should be printed by the debugger when displaying a frame. 6201 6202 remote put 6203 remote get 6204 remote delete 6205 Transfer files to and from a remote target, and delete remote files. 6206 6207 * New MI commands 6208 6209 -target-file-put 6210 -target-file-get 6211 -target-file-delete 6212 Transfer files to and from a remote target, and delete remote files. 6213 6214 * New remote packets 6215 6216 vFile:open: 6217 vFile:close: 6218 vFile:pread: 6219 vFile:pwrite: 6220 vFile:unlink: 6221 Open, close, read, write, and delete files on the remote system. 6222 6223 vAttach 6224 Attach to an existing process on the remote system, in extended-remote 6225 mode. 6226 6227 vRun 6228 Run a new process on the remote system, in extended-remote mode. 6229 6230 *** Changes in GDB 6.7 6231 6232 * Resolved 101 resource leaks, null pointer dereferences, etc. in gdb, 6233 bfd, libiberty and opcodes, as revealed by static analysis donated by 6234 Coverity, Inc. (http://scan.coverity.com). 6235 6236 * When looking up multiply-defined global symbols, GDB will now prefer the 6237 symbol definition in the current shared library if it was built using the 6238 -Bsymbolic linker option. 6239 6240 * When the Text User Interface (TUI) is not configured, GDB will now 6241 recognize the -tui command-line option and print a message that the TUI 6242 is not supported. 6243 6244 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now has lower overhead for high 6245 frequency signals (e.g. SIGALRM) via the QPassSignals packet. 6246 6247 * GDB for MIPS targets now autodetects whether a remote target provides 6248 32-bit or 64-bit register values. 6249 6250 * Support for C++ member pointers has been improved. 6251 6252 * GDB now understands XML target descriptions, which specify the 6253 target's overall architecture. GDB can read a description from 6254 a local file or over the remote serial protocol. 6255 6256 * Vectors of single-byte data use a new integer type which is not 6257 automatically displayed as character or string data. 6258 6259 * The /s format now works with the print command. It displays 6260 arrays of single-byte integers and pointers to single-byte integers 6261 as strings. 6262 6263 * Target descriptions can now describe target-specific registers, 6264 for architectures which have implemented the support (currently 6265 only ARM, M68K, and MIPS). 6266 6267 * GDB and the GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now support the XScale 6268 iWMMXt coprocessor. 6269 6270 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, has been updated to support 6271 ARM Windows CE (mingw32ce) debugging, and GDB Windows CE support 6272 has been rewritten to use the standard GDB remote protocol. 6273 6274 * GDB can now step into C++ functions which are called through thunks. 6275 6276 * GDB for the Cell/B.E. SPU now supports overlay debugging. 6277 6278 * The GDB remote protocol \\"qOffsets\\" packet can now honor ELF segment 6279 layout. It also supports a TextSeg= and DataSeg= response when only 6280 segment base addresses (rather than offsets) are available. 6281 6282 * The /i format now outputs any trailing branch delay slot instructions 6283 immediately following the last instruction within the count specified. 6284 6285 * The GDB remote protocol \\"T\\" stop reply packet now supports a 6286 \\"library\\" response. Combined with the new \\"qXfer:libraries:read\\" 6287 packet, this response allows GDB to debug shared libraries on targets 6288 where the operating system manages the list of loaded libraries (e.g. 6289 Windows and SymbianOS). 6290 6291 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports dynamic link libraries 6292 (DLLs) on Windows and Windows CE targets. 6293 6294 * GDB now supports a faster verification that a .debug file matches its binary 6295 according to its build-id signature, if the signature is present. 6296 6297 * New commands 6298 6299 set remoteflow 6300 show remoteflow 6301 Enable or disable hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) on the serial port 6302 when debugging using remote targets. 6303 6304 set mem inaccessible-by-default 6305 show mem inaccessible-by-default 6306 If the target supplies a memory map, for instance via the remote 6307 protocol's \\"qXfer:memory-map:read\\" packet, setting this variable 6308 prevents GDB from accessing memory outside the memory map. This 6309 is useful for targets with memory mapped registers or which react 6310 badly to accesses of unmapped address space. 6311 6312 set breakpoint auto-hw 6313 show breakpoint auto-hw 6314 If the target supplies a memory map, for instance via the remote 6315 protocol's \\"qXfer:memory-map:read\\" packet, setting this variable 6316 lets GDB use hardware breakpoints automatically for memory regions 6317 where it can not use software breakpoints. This covers both the 6318 \\"break\\" command and internal breakpoints used for other commands 6319 including \\"next\\" and \\"finish\\". 6320 6321 catch exception 6322 catch exception unhandled 6323 Stop the program execution when Ada exceptions are raised. 6324 6325 catch assert 6326 Stop the program execution when an Ada assertion failed. 6327 6328 set sysroot 6329 show sysroot 6330 Set an alternate system root for target files.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"Starting strength program","completion":"Starting Strength is a strength training program designed by Mark Rippetoe that has gained widespread popularity for its focus on the fundamentals of barbell training. The program is designed to be simple, efficient, and effective at increasing strength for beginners to intermediate lifters. The core of the Starting Strength program revolves around five barbell exercises: 1. Squat 2. Deadlift 3. Bench Press 4. Overhead Press 5. Power Clean (sometimes replaced with barbell rows for beginners) The program is typically structured as follows, with workouts alternating between Workout A and Workout B, performed three times per week on non-consecutive days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday): Workout A: - Squat: 3 sets of 5 reps - Bench Press: 3 sets of 5 reps - Deadlift: 1 set of 5 reps Workout B: - Squat: 3 sets of 5 reps - Overhead Press: 3 sets of 5 reps - Power Clean: 5 sets of 3 reps (or Barbell Rows: 3 sets of 5 reps if cleans are not being performed) The goal of the program is to add weight to each exercise every session (adding 5 pounds to upper body lifts and 10 pounds to lower body lifts) as long as the lifter can complete all of the reps and sets with proper form. This allows for a steady increase in strength and muscle mass over time. Starting Strength also places a heavy emphasis on proper technique and includes a deep dive into the intricacies of performing each lift effectively. Rippetoe's book, \\"Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training,\\" provides detailed instructions on how to execute each movement, as well as the theory and rationale behind the program's design. Beginners may experience rapid strength gains, often referred to as \\"newbie gains,\\" as they adapt to the stresses of the program. As lifters progress, they may need to make adjustments to the programming, such as microloading (adding smaller increments of weight), taking more rest days, or incorporating additional exercises to address specific weaknesses. It's always recommended to start with weights that are manageable and to focus on form before adding weight. Additionally, it's crucial to listen to your body and make adjustments as needed, especially if you encounter pain or discomfort. If you're new to lifting or experiencing stalling in your progress, seeking the guidance of a qualified strength coach or personal trainer familiar with the Starting Strength program can be highly beneficial."},{"prompt":"gitgit://sourceware.org / binutils-gdb.git / blob ? search: re 2638b3e0d9ca573d4e284f4f26d19409123ebc7b [binutils-gdb.git] / gdb / NEWS 1 What has changed in GDB? 2 (Organized release by release) 3 4 *** Changes since GDB 14 5 6 * Building GDB and GDBserver now requires a C++17 compiler. 7 For example, GCC 9 or later. 8 9 * GDB index now contains information about the main function. This speeds up 10 startup when it is being used for some large binaries. 11 12 * On hosts where threading is available, DWARF reading is now done in 13 the background, resulting in faster startup. This can be controlled 14 using \\"maint set dwarf synchronous\\". 15 16 * Changed commands 17 18 disassemble 19 Attempting to use both the 'r' and 'b' flags with the disassemble 20 command will now give an error. Previously the 'b' flag would 21 always override the 'r' flag. 22 23 maintenance info line-table 24 Add an EPILOGUE-BEGIN column to the output of the command. It indicates 25 if the line is considered the start of the epilgoue, and thus a point at 26 which the frame can be considered destroyed. 27 28 * New commands 29 30 info missing-debug-handler 31 List all the registered missing debug handlers. 32 33 enable missing-debug-handler LOCUS HANDLER 34 disable missing-debug-handler LOCUS HANDLER 35 Enable or disable a missing debug handler with a name matching the 36 regular expression HANDLER, in LOCUS. 37 38 LOCUS can be 'global' to operate on global missing debug handler, 39 'progspace' to operate on handlers within the current program space, 40 or can be a regular expression which is matched against the filename 41 of the primary executable in each program space. 42 43 maintenance info linux-lwps 44 List all LWPs under control of the linux-nat target. 45 46 set remote thread-options-packet 47 show remote thread-options-packet 48 Set/show the use of the thread options packet. 49 50 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 51 52 ** The --remote-debug and --event-loop-debug command line options 53 have been removed. 54 55 ** The --debug command line option now takes an optional comma 56 separated list of components to emit debug for. The currently 57 supported components are: all, threads, event-loop, and remote. 58 If no components are given then threads is assumed. 59 60 ** The 'monitor set remote-debug' and 'monitor set event-loop-debug' 61 command have been removed. 62 63 ** The 'monitor set debug 0|1' command has been extended to take a 64 component name, e.g.: 'monitor set debug COMPONENT off|on'. 65 Possible component names are: all, threads, event-loop, and 66 remote. 67 68 * Python API 69 70 ** New function gdb.notify_mi(NAME, DATA), that emits custom 71 GDB/MI async notification. 72 73 ** New read/write attribute gdb.Value.bytes that contains a bytes 74 object holding the contents of this value. 75 76 ** New module gdb.missing_debug that facilitates dealing with 77 objfiles that are missing any debug information. 78 79 ** New function gdb.missing_debug.register_handler that can register 80 an instance of a sub-class of gdb.missing_debug.MissingDebugInfo 81 as a handler for objfiles that are missing debug information. 82 83 ** New class gdb.missing_debug.MissingDebugInfo which can be 84 sub-classed to create handlers for objfiles with missing debug 85 information. 86 87 ** Stop events now have a \\"details\\" attribute that holds a 88 dictionary that carries the same information as an MI \\"*stopped\\" 89 event. 90 91 ** New function gdb.interrupt(), that interrupts GDB as if the user 92 typed control-c. 93 94 ** New gdb.InferiorThread.ptid_string attribute. This read-only 95 attribute contains the string that appears in the 'Target Id' 96 column of the 'info threads' command output. 97 98 ** It is no longer possible to create new gdb.Progspace object using 99 'gdb.Progspace()', this will result in a TypeError. Progspace 100 objects can still be obtained through calling other API 101 functions, for example 'gdb.current_progspace()'. 102 103 ** User defined attributes can be added to a gdb.Inferior object, 104 these will be stored in the object's new Inferior.__dict__ 105 attribute. 106 107 ** User defined attributes can be added to a gdb.InferiorThread 108 object, these will be stored in the object's new 109 InferiorThread.__dict__ attribute. 110 111 ** New constants gdb.SYMBOL_TYPE_DOMAIN, gdb.SYMBOL_FUNCTION_DOMAIN, 112 and gdb.SEARCH_*_DOMAIN corresponding to all the existing symbol 113 domains. Symbol lookup can now search in multiple domains at 114 once, and can also narrowly search for just a type or function. 115 116 * Debugger Adapter Protocol changes 117 118 ** GDB now emits the \\"process\\" event. 119 120 ** GDB now supports the \\"cancel\\" request. 121 122 ** The \\"attach\\" request now supports specifying the program. 123 124 ** New command \\"set debug dap-log-level\\" controls DAP logging. 125 126 ** The \\"set debug dap-log-file\\" command is now documented. This 127 command was available in GDB 14 but not documented. 128 129 * Guile API 130 131 ** New constants SYMBOL_TYPE_DOMAIN, SYMBOL_FUNCTION_DOMAIN, and 132 SEARCH_*_DOMAIN corresponding to all the existing symbol domains. 133 Symbol lookup can now search in multiple domains at once, and can 134 also narrowly search for just a type or function. 135 136 * New remote packets 137 138 New stop reason: clone 139 Indicates that a clone system call was executed. 140 141 QThreadOptions 142 Enable/disable optional event reporting, on a per-thread basis. 143 Currently supported options are GDB_THREAD_OPTION_CLONE, to enable 144 clone event reporting, and GDB_THREAD_OPTION_EXIT to enable thread 145 exit event reporting. 146 147 QThreadOptions in qSupported 148 The qSupported packet allows GDB to inform the stub it supports the 149 QThreadOptions packet, and the qSupported response can contain the 150 set of thread options the remote stub supports. 151 152 *** Changes in GDB 14 153 154 * GDB now supports the AArch64 Scalable Matrix Extension 2 (SME2), which 155 includes a new 512 bit lookup table register named ZT0. 156 157 * GDB now supports the AArch64 Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), which includes 158 a new matrix register named ZA, a new thread register TPIDR2 and a new vector 159 length register SVG (streaming vector granule). GDB also supports tracking 160 ZA state across signal frames. 161 162 Some features are still under development or are dependent on ABI specs that 163 are still in alpha stage. For example, manual function calls with ZA state 164 don't have any special handling, and tracking of SVG changes based on 165 DWARF information is still not implemented, but there are plans to do so in 166 the future. 167 168 * GDB now recognizes the NO_COLOR environment variable and disables 169 styling according to the spec. See https://no-color.org/. 170 Styling can be re-enabled with \\"set style enabled on\\". 171 172 * The AArch64 'org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth' Pointer Authentication feature string 173 has been deprecated in favor of the 'org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth_v2' feature 174 string. 175 176 * GDB now has some support for integer types larger than 64 bits. 177 178 * Removed targets and native configurations 179 180 GDB no longer supports AIX 4.x, AIX 5.x and AIX 6.x. The minimum supported 181 AIX version is now AIX 7.1. 182 183 * Multi-target feature configuration 184 185 GDB now supports the individual configuration of remote targets' feature 186 sets. Based on the current selection of a target, the commands 'set remote 187 <name>-packet (on|off|auto)' and 'show remote <name>-packet' can be used to 188 configure a target's feature packet and to display its configuration, 189 respectively. 190 191 The individual packet sizes can be configured and shown using the commands 192 ** 'set remote memory-read-packet-size (number of bytes|fixed|limit)' 193 ** 'set remote memory-write-packet-size (number of bytes|fixed|limit)' 194 ** 'show remote memory-read-packet-size' 195 ** 'show remote memory-write-packet-size'. 196 197 The configuration of the packet itself, as well as the size of a memory-read 198 or memory-write packet applies to the currently selected target (if 199 available). If no target is selected, it applies to future remote 200 connections. Similarly, the show commands print the configuration of the 201 currently selected target. If no remote target is selected, the default 202 configuration for future connections is shown. 203 204 * GDB has initial built-in support for the Debugger Adapter Protocol. 205 This support requires that GDB be built with Python scripting 206 enabled. 207 208 * For the break command, multiple uses of the 'thread' or 'task' 209 keywords will now give an error instead of just using the thread or 210 task id from the last instance of the keyword. E.g.: 211 break foo thread 1 thread 2 212 will now give an error rather than using 'thread 2'. 213 214 * For the watch command, multiple uses of the 'task' keyword will now 215 give an error instead of just using the task id from the last 216 instance of the keyword. E.g.: 217 watch my_var task 1 task 2 218 will now give an error rather than using 'task 2'. The 'thread' 219 keyword already gave an error when used multiple times with the 220 watch command, this remains unchanged. 221 222 * The 'set print elements' setting now helps when printing large arrays. 223 If an array would otherwise exceed max-value-size, but 'print elements' 224 is set such that the size of elements to print is less than or equal 225 to 'max-value-size', GDB will now still print the array, however only 226 'max-value-size' worth of data will be added into the value history. 227 228 * For both the break and watch commands, it is now invalid to use both 229 the 'thread' and 'task' keywords within the same command. For 230 example the following commnds will now give an error: 231 break foo thread 1 task 1 232 watch var thread 2 task 3 233 234 * The printf command now accepts a '%V' output format which will 235 format an expression just as the 'print' command would. Print 236 options can be placed withing '[...]' after the '%V' to modify how 237 the value is printed. E.g: 238 printf \\"%V\\", some_array 239 printf \\"%V[-array-indexes on]\\", some_array 240 will print the array without, or with array indexes included, just 241 as the array would be printed by the 'print' command. This 242 functionality is also available for dprintf when dprintf-style is 243 'gdb'. 244 245 * When the printf command requires a string to be fetched from the 246 inferior, GDB now uses the existing 'max-value-size' setting to the 247 limit the memory allocated within GDB. The default 'max-value-size' 248 is 64k. To print longer strings you should increase 249 'max-value-size'. 250 251 * The Ada 2022 Enum_Rep and Enum_Val attributes are now supported. 252 253 * The Ada 2022 target name symbol ('@') is now supported by the Ada 254 expression parser. 255 256 * The 'list' command now accepts '.' as an argument, which tells GDB to 257 print the location around the point of execution within the current frame. 258 If the inferior hasn't started yet, the command will print around the 259 beginning of the 'main' function. 260 261 * Using the 'list' command with no arguments in a situation where the 262 command would attempt to list past the end of the file now warns the 263 user that the end of file has been reached, refers the user to the 264 newly added '.' argument 265 266 * Breakpoints can now be inferior-specific. This is similar to the 267 existing thread-specific breakpoint support. Breakpoint conditions 268 can include the 'inferior' keyword followed by an inferior id (as 269 displayed in the 'info inferiors' output). It is invalid to use the 270 'inferior' keyword with either the 'thread' or 'task' keywords when 271 creating a breakpoint. 272 273 * New convenience function \\"_shell\\", to execute a shell command and 274 return the result. This lets you run shell commands in expressions. 275 Some examples: 276 277 (gdb) p _shell(\\"true\\") 278 1 = 0 279 (gdb) p _shell(\\"false\\") 280 2 = 1 281 (gdb) break func if _shell(\\"some command\\") == 0 282 283 * Configure changes 284 285 --additional-debug-dirs=PATHs 286 287 Provide a colon-separated list of additional directories to search for 288 separate debug info. These directories are added to the default value of 289 the 'debug-file-directory' GDB parameter. 290 291 * New commands 292 293 set debug breakpoint on|off 294 show debug breakpoint 295 Print additional debug messages about breakpoint insertion and removal. 296 297 maintenance print record-instruction [ N ] 298 Print the recorded information for a given instruction. If N is not given 299 prints how GDB would undo the last instruction executed. If N is negative, 300 prints how GDB would undo the N-th previous instruction, and if N is 301 positive, it prints how GDB will redo the N-th following instruction. 302 303 maintenance info frame-unwinders 304 List the frame unwinders currently in effect, starting with the highest 305 priority. 306 307 maintenance wait-for-index-cache 308 Wait until all pending writes to the index cache have completed. 309 310 set always-read-ctf on|off 311 show always-read-ctf 312 When off, CTF is only read if DWARF is not present. When on, CTF is 313 read regardless of whether DWARF is present. Off by default. 314 315 info main 316 Get main symbol to identify entry point into program. 317 318 set tui mouse-events [on|off] 319 show tui mouse-events 320 When on (default), mouse clicks control the TUI and can be accessed by 321 Python extensions. When off, mouse clicks are handled by the terminal, 322 enabling terminal-native text selection. 323 324 * MI changes 325 326 ** MI version 1 has been removed. 327 328 ** mi now reports 'no-history' as a stop reason when hitting the end of the 329 reverse execution history. 330 331 ** When creating a thread-specific breakpoint using the '-p' option, 332 the -break-insert command would report the 'thread' field twice in 333 the reply. The content of both fields was always identical. This 334 has now been fixed; the 'thread' field will be reported just once 335 for thread-specific breakpoints, or not at all for breakpoints 336 without a thread restriction. The same is also true for the 'task' 337 field of an Ada task-specific breakpoint. 338 339 ** It is no longer possible to create a thread-specific breakpoint for 340 a thread that doesn't exist using '-break-insert -p ID'. Creating 341 breakpoints for non-existent threads is not allowed when using the 342 CLI, that the MI allowed it was a long standing bug, which has now 343 been fixed. 344 345 ** The '--simple-values' argument to the '-stack-list-arguments', 346 '-stack-list-locals', '-stack-list-variables', and '-var-list-children' 347 commands now takes reference types into account: that is, a value is now 348 considered simple if it is neither an array, structure, or union, nor a 349 reference to an array, structure, or union. (Previously all references were 350 considered simple.) Support for this feature can be verified by using the 351 '-list-features' command, which should contain \\"simple-values-ref-types\\". 352 353 ** The -break-insert command now accepts a '-g thread-group-id' option 354 to allow for the creation of inferior-specific breakpoints. 355 356 ** The bkpt tuple, which appears in breakpoint-created notifications, 357 and in the result of the -break-insert command can now include an 358 optional 'inferior' field for both the main breakpoint, and each 359 location, when the breakpoint is inferior-specific. 360 361 * Python API 362 363 ** gdb.ThreadExitedEvent added. Emits a ThreadEvent. 364 365 ** The gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.name attribute is now read-only. 366 367 ** The name argument passed to gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.__init__ must 368 now be of type 'str' otherwise a TypeError will be raised. 369 370 ** The gdb.unwinder.Unwinder.enabled attribute can now only accept 371 values of type 'bool'. Changing this attribute will now 372 invalidate GDB's frame-cache, which means GDB will need to 373 rebuild its frame-cache when next required - either with, or 374 without the particular unwinder, depending on how 'enabled' was 375 changed. 376 377 ** New methods added to the gdb.PendingFrame class. These methods 378 have the same behaviour as the corresponding methods on 379 gdb.Frame. The new methods are: 380 381 - gdb.PendingFrame.name: Return the name for the frame's 382 function, or None. 383 - gdb.PendingFrame.is_valid: Return True if the pending frame 384 object is valid. 385 - gdb.PendingFrame.pc: Return the pc register value for this 386 frame. 387 - gdb.PendingFrame.language: Return a string containing the 388 language for this frame, or None. 389 - gdb.PendingFrame.find_sal: Return a gdb.Symtab_and_line 390 object for the current location within the pending frame, or 391 None. 392 - gdb.PendingFrame.block: Return a gdb.Block for the current 393 pending frame, or None. 394 - gdb.PendingFrame.function: Return a gdb.Symbol for the 395 current pending frame, or None. 396 397 ** The frame-id passed to gdb.PendingFrame.create_unwind_info can 398 now use either an integer or a gdb.Value object for each of its 399 'sp', 'pc', and 'special' attributes. 400 401 ** A new class gdb.unwinder.FrameId has been added. Instances of 402 this class are constructed with 'sp' (stack-pointer) and 'pc' 403 (program-counter) values, and can be used as the frame-id when 404 calling gdb.PendingFrame.create_unwind_info. 405 406 ** It is now no longer possible to sub-class the 407 gdb.disassembler.DisassemblerResult type. 408 409 ** The Disassembler API from the gdb.disassembler module has been 410 extended to include styling support: 411 412 - The DisassemblerResult class can now be initialized with a list 413 of parts. Each part represents part of the disassembled 414 instruction along with the associated style information. This 415 list of parts can be accessed with the new 416 DisassemblerResult.parts property. 417 418 - New constants gdb.disassembler.STYLE_* representing all the 419 different styles part of an instruction might have. 420 421 - New methods DisassembleInfo.text_part and 422 DisassembleInfo.address_part which are used to create the new 423 styled parts of a disassembled instruction. 424 425 - Changes are backwards compatible, the older API can still be 426 used to disassemble instructions without styling. 427 428 ** New function gdb.execute_mi(COMMAND, [ARG]...), that invokes a 429 GDB/MI command and returns the output as a Python dictionary. 430 431 ** New function gdb.block_signals(). This returns a context manager 432 that blocks any signals that GDB needs to handle itself. 433 434 ** New class gdb.Thread. This is a subclass of threading.Thread 435 that calls gdb.block_signals in its \\"start\\" method. 436 437 ** gdb.parse_and_eval now has a new \\"global_context\\" parameter. 438 This can be used to request that the parse only examine global 439 symbols. 440 441 ** gdb.Inferior now has a new \\"arguments\\" attribute. This holds the 442 command-line arguments to the inferior, if known. 443 444 ** gdb.Inferior now has a new \\"main_name\\" attribute. This holds the 445 name of the inferior's \\"main\\", if known. 446 447 ** gdb.Inferior now has new methods \\"clear_env\\", \\"set_env\\", and 448 \\"unset_env\\". These can be used to modify the inferior's 449 environment before it is started. 450 451 ** gdb.Value now has the 'assign' method. 452 453 ** gdb.Value now has the 'to_array' method. This converts an 454 array-like Value to an array. 455 456 ** gdb.Progspace now has the new method \\"objfile_for_address\\". This 457 returns the gdb.Objfile, if any, that covers a given address. 458 459 ** gdb.Breakpoint now has an \\"inferior\\" attribute. If the 460 Breakpoint object is inferior specific then this attribute holds 461 the inferior-id (an integer). If the Breakpoint object is not 462 inferior specific, then this field contains None. This field can 463 be written too. 464 465 ** gdb.Type now has the \\"is_array_like\\" and \\"is_string_like\\" 466 methods. These reflect GDB's internal idea of whether a type 467 might be array- or string-like, even if they do not have the 468 corresponding type code. 469 470 ** gdb.ValuePrinter is a new class that can be used as the base 471 class for the result of applying a pretty-printer. As a base 472 class, it signals to gdb that the printer may implement new 473 pretty-printer methods. 474 475 ** New attribute Progspace.symbol_file. This attribute holds the 476 gdb.Objfile that corresponds to Progspace.filename (when 477 Progspace.filename is not None), otherwise, this attribute is 478 itself None. 479 480 ** New attribute Progspace.executable_filename. This attribute 481 holds a string containing a file name set by the \\"exec-file\\" or 482 \\"file\\" commands, or None if no executable file is set. This 483 isn't the exact string passed by the user to these commands; the 484 file name will have been partially resolved to an absolute file 485 name. 486 487 ** A new executable_changed event registry is available. This event 488 emits ExecutableChangedEvent objects, which have 'progspace' (a 489 gdb.Progspace) and 'reload' (a Boolean) attributes. This event 490 is emitted when gdb.Progspace.executable_filename changes. 491 492 ** New event registries gdb.events.new_progspace and 493 gdb.events.free_progspace, these emit NewProgspaceEvent and 494 FreeProgspaceEvent event types respectively. Both of these event 495 types have a single 'progspace' attribute, which is the 496 gdb.Progspace that is either being added to GDB, or removed from 497 GDB. 498 499 ** gdb.LazyString now implements the __str__ method. 500 501 ** New method gdb.Frame.static_link that returns the outer frame 502 of a nested function frame. 503 504 *** Changes in GDB 13 505 506 * MI version 1 is deprecated, and will be removed in GDB 14. 507 508 * GDB now supports dumping memory tag data for AArch64 MTE. It also supports 509 reading memory tag data for AArch64 MTE from core files generated by 510 the gcore command or the Linux kernel. 511 512 When a process uses memory-mapped pages protected by memory tags (for 513 example, AArch64 MTE), this additional information will be recorded in 514 the core file in the event of a crash or if GDB generates a core file 515 from the current process state. GDB will show this additional information 516 automatically, or through one of the memory-tag subcommands. 517 518 * Scheduler-locking and new threads 519 520 When scheduler-locking is in effect, only the current thread may run 521 when the inferior is resumed. However, previously, new threads 522 created by the resumed thread would still be able to run free. Now, 523 they are held stopped. 524 525 * \\"info breakpoints\\" now displays enabled breakpoint locations of 526 disabled breakpoints as in the \\"y-\\" state. For example: 527 528 (gdb) info breakpoints 529 Num Type Disp Enb Address What 530 1 breakpoint keep n <MULTIPLE> 531 1.1 y- 0x00000000000011b6 in ... 532 1.2 y- 0x00000000000011c2 in ... 533 1.3 n 0x00000000000011ce in ... 534 535 * Support for Thread Local Storage (TLS) variables on FreeBSD arm and 536 aarch64 architectures. 537 538 * GDB now supports hardware watchpoints on FreeBSD/Aarch64. 539 540 * Remove support for building against Python 2, it is now only possible to 541 build GDB against Python 3. 542 543 * DBX mode has been removed. 544 545 * GDB now honours the DWARF prologue_end line-table entry flag the compiler can 546 emit to indicate where a breakpoint should be placed to break in a function 547 past its prologue. 548 549 * Completion now also offers \\"NUMBER\\" for \\"set\\" commands that accept 550 a numeric argument and the \\"unlimited\\" keyword. For example: 551 552 (gdb) set width <TAB> 553 NUMBER unlimited 554 555 and consequently: 556 557 (gdb) complete set width 558 set width NUMBER 559 set width unlimited 560 561 * Disassembler styling using libopcodes. GDB now supports 562 disassembler styling using libopcodes. This is only available for 563 some targets (currently x86 and RISC-V). For unsupported targets 564 Python Pygments is still used. For supported targets, libopcodes 565 styling is used by default. 566 567 * The Windows native target now supports target async. 568 569 * gdb now supports zstd compressed debug sections (ELFCOMPRESS_ZSTD) for ELF. 570 571 * The format of 'disassemble /r' and 'record instruction-history /r' 572 has changed. The instruction bytes could now be grouped together, 573 and displayed in the endianness of the instruction. This is the 574 same layout as used by GNU objdump when disassembling. 575 576 There is now 'disassemble /b' and 'record instruction-history /b' 577 which will always display the instructions bytes one at a time in 578 memory order, that is, the byte at the lowest address first. 579 580 For both /r and /b GDB is now better at using whitespace in order to 581 align the disassembled instruction text. 582 583 * The TUI no longer styles the source and assembly code highlighted by 584 the current position indicator by default. You can however 585 re-enable styling using the new \\"set style tui-current-position\\" 586 command. 587 588 * New convenience variable _inferior_thread_count contains the number 589 of live threads in the current inferior. 590 591 * When a breakpoint with multiple code locations is hit, GDB now prints 592 the code location using the syntax <breakpoint_number>.<location_number> 593 such as in: 594 Thread 1 \\"zeoes\\" hit Breakpoint 2.3, some_func () at zeoes.c:8 595 596 * When a breakpoint is hit, GDB now sets the convenience variables _hit_bpnum 597 and _hit_locno to the hit breakpoint number and code location number. 598 This allows to disable the last hit breakpoint using 599 (gdb) disable _hit_bpnum 600 or disable only the specific breakpoint code location using 601 (gdb) disable _hit_bpnum._hit_locno 602 These commands can be used inside the command list of a breakpoint to 603 automatically disable the just encountered breakpoint (or the just 604 encountered specific breakpoint code location). 605 When a breakpoint has only one location, _hit_locno is set to 1 so that 606 (gdb) disable _hit_bpnum._hit_locno 607 and 608 (gdb) disable _hit_bpnum 609 are both disabling the breakpoint. 610 611 * New commands 612 613 maintenance set ignore-prologue-end-flag on|off 614 maintenance show ignore-prologue-end-flag 615 This setting, which is off by default, controls whether GDB ignores the 616 PROLOGUE-END flag from the line-table when skipping prologue. This can be 617 used to force GDB to use prologue analyzers if the line-table is constructed 618 from erroneous debug information. 619 620 set print nibbles [on|off] 621 show print nibbles 622 This controls whether the 'print/t' command will display binary values 623 in groups of four bits, known as \\"nibbles\\". The default is 'off'. 624 625 maintenance set libopcodes-styling on|off 626 maintenance show libopcodes-styling 627 These can be used to force off libopcodes based styling, the Python 628 Pygments styling will then be used instead. 629 630 set style disassembler comment 631 show style disassembler comment 632 set style disassembler immediate 633 show style disassembler immediate 634 set style disassembler mnemonic 635 show style disassembler mnemonic 636 set style disassembler register 637 show style disassembler register 638 set style disassembler address 639 show style disassembler address 640 set style disassembler symbol 641 show style disassembler symbol 642 For targets that support libopcodes based styling, these settings 643 control how various aspects of the disassembler output are styled. 644 The 'disassembler address' and 'disassembler symbol' styles are 645 aliases for the 'address' and 'function' styles respectively. 646 647 maintenance print frame-id [ LEVEL ] 648 Print GDB's internal frame-id for the frame at LEVEL. If LEVEL is 649 not given, then print the frame-id for the currently selected frame. 650 651 set debug infcall on|off 652 show debug infcall 653 Print additional debug messages about inferior function calls. 654 655 set debug solib on|off 656 show debug solib 657 Print additional debug messages about shared library handling. 658 659 set style tui-current-position [on|off] 660 Whether to style the source and assembly code highlighted by the 661 TUI's current position indicator. The default is off. 662 663 set print characters LIMIT 664 show print characters 665 This new setting is like 'set print elements', but controls how many 666 characters of a string are printed. This functionality used to be 667 covered by 'set print elements', but it can be controlled separately 668 now. LIMIT can be set to a numerical value to request that particular 669 character count, to 'unlimited' to print all characters of a string, 670 or to 'elements', which is also the default, to follow the setting of 671 'set print elements' as it used to be. 672 673 print -characters LIMIT 674 This new option to the 'print' command has the same effect as a temporary 675 use of 'set print characters'. 676 677 * Changed commands 678 679 document user-defined 680 It is now possible to document user-defined aliases. 681 When a user-defined alias is documented, the help and apropos commands 682 use the provided documentation instead of the documentation of the 683 aliased command. 684 Documenting a user-defined alias is particularly useful when the alias 685 is a set of nested 'with' commands to avoid showing the help of 686 the with command for an alias that will in fact launch the 687 last command given in the nested commands. 688 689 maintenance info line-table 690 Add a PROLOGUE-END column to the output which indicates that an 691 entry corresponds to an address where a breakpoint should be placed 692 to be at the first instruction past a function's prologue. 693 694 * Removed commands 695 696 set debug aix-solib on|off 697 show debug aix-solib 698 set debug solib-frv on|off 699 show debug solib-frv 700 Removed in favor of \\"set/show debug solib\\". 701 702 maintenance info program-spaces 703 This command now includes a 'Core File' column which indicates the 704 name of the core file associated with each program space. 705 706 * New targets 707 708 GNU/Linux/LoongArch (gdbserver) loongarch*-*-linux* 709 710 GNU/Linux/CSKY (gdbserver) csky*-*linux* 711 712 AMDGPU amdgcn-*-* 713 714 * MI changes 715 716 ** The async record stating the stopped reason 'breakpoint-hit' now 717 contains an optional field locno giving the code location number 718 when the breakpoint has multiple code locations. 719 720 * Python API 721 722 ** GDB will now reformat the doc string for gdb.Command and 723 gdb.Parameter sub-classes to remove unnecessary leading 724 whitespace from each line before using the string as the help 725 output. 726 727 ** New function gdb.format_address(ADDRESS, PROGSPACE, ARCHITECTURE), 728 that formats ADDRESS as 'address <symbol+offset>', where symbol is 729 looked up in PROGSPACE, and ARCHITECTURE is used to format address. 730 This is the same format that GDB uses when printing address, symbol, 731 and offset information from the disassembler. 732 733 ** New function gdb.current_language that returns the name of the 734 current language. Unlike gdb.parameter('language'), this will 735 never return 'auto'. 736 737 ** New method gdb.Frame.language that returns the name of the 738 frame's language. 739 740 ** New Python API for wrapping GDB's disassembler: 741 742 - gdb.disassembler.register_disassembler(DISASSEMBLER, ARCH). 743 DISASSEMBLER is a sub-class of gdb.disassembler.Disassembler. 744 ARCH is either None or a string containing a bfd architecture 745 name. DISASSEMBLER is registered as a disassembler for 746 architecture ARCH, or for all architectures if ARCH is None. 747 The previous disassembler registered for ARCH is returned, this 748 can be None if no previous disassembler was registered. 749 750 - gdb.disassembler.Disassembler is the class from which all 751 disassemblers should inherit. Its constructor takes a string, 752 a name for the disassembler, which is currently only used in 753 some debug output. Sub-classes should override the __call__ 754 method to perform disassembly, invoking __call__ on this base 755 class will raise an exception. 756 757 - gdb.disassembler.DisassembleInfo is the class used to describe 758 a single disassembly request from GDB. An instance of this 759 class is passed to the __call__ method of 760 gdb.disassembler.Disassembler and has the following read-only 761 attributes: 'address', and 'architecture', as well as the 762 following method: 'read_memory'. 763 764 - gdb.disassembler.builtin_disassemble(INFO, MEMORY_SOURCE), 765 calls GDB's builtin disassembler on INFO, which is a 766 gdb.disassembler.DisassembleInfo object. MEMORY_SOURCE is 767 optional, its default value is None. If MEMORY_SOURCE is not 768 None then it must be an object that has a 'read_memory' method. 769 770 - gdb.disassembler.DisassemblerResult is a class that can be used 771 to wrap the result of a call to a Disassembler. It has 772 read-only attributes 'length' and 'string'. 773 774 ** gdb.Objfile now has an attribute named \\"is_file\\". This is True 775 if the objfile comes from a file, and False otherwise. 776 777 ** New function gdb.print_options that returns a dictionary of the 778 prevailing print options, in the form accepted by 779 gdb.Value.format_string. 780 781 ** gdb.Value.format_string now uses the format provided by 'print', 782 if it is called during a 'print' or other similar operation. 783 784 ** gdb.Value.format_string now accepts the 'summary' keyword. This 785 can be used to request a shorter representation of a value, the 786 way that 'set print frame-arguments scalars' does. 787 788 ** New Python type gdb.BreakpointLocation. 789 The new attribute 'locations' of gdb.Breakpoint returns a list of 790 gdb.BreakpointLocation objects specifying the locations where the 791 breakpoint is inserted into the debuggee. 792 793 ** The gdb.register_window_type method now restricts the set of 794 acceptable window names. The first character of a window's name 795 must start with a character in the set [a-zA-Z], every subsequent 796 character of a window's name must be in the set [-_.a-zA-Z0-9]. 797 798 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 799 800 ** GDBserver is now supported on LoongArch GNU/Linux. 801 802 ** GDBserver is now supported on CSKY GNU/Linux. 803 804 * LoongArch floating-point support 805 806 GDB now supports floating-point on LoongArch GNU/Linux. 807 808 * AMD GPU ROCm debugging support 809 810 GDB now supports debugging programs offloaded to AMD GPUs using the ROCm 811 platform. 812 813 *** Changes in GDB 12 814 815 * DBX mode is deprecated, and will be removed in GDB 13 816 817 * GDB 12 is the last release of GDB that will support building against 818 Python 2. From GDB 13, it will only be possible to build GDB itself 819 with Python 3 support. 820 821 * The disable-randomization setting now works on Windows. 822 823 * Improved C++ template support 824 825 GDB now treats functions/types involving C++ templates like it does function 826 overloads. Users may omit parameter lists to set breakpoints on families of 827 template functions, including types/functions composed of multiple template types: 828 829 (gdb) break template_func(template_1, int) 830 831 The above will set breakpoints at every function \`template_func' where 832 the first function parameter is any template type named \`template_1' and 833 the second function parameter is \`int'. 834 835 TAB completion also gains similar improvements. 836 837 * The FreeBSD native target now supports async mode. 838 839 * Configure changes 840 841 --enable-threading 842 843 Enable or disable multithreaded symbol loading. This is enabled 844 by default, but passing --disable-threading or --enable-threading=no 845 to configure will disable it. 846 847 Disabling this can cause a performance penalty when there are a lot of 848 symbols to load, but is useful for debugging purposes. 849 850 * New commands 851 852 maint set backtrace-on-fatal-signal on|off 853 maint show backtrace-on-fatal-signal 854 This setting is 'on' by default. When 'on' GDB will print a limited 855 backtrace to stderr in the situation where GDB terminates with a 856 fatal signal. This only supported on some platforms where the 857 backtrace and backtrace_symbols_fd functions are available. 858 859 set source open on|off 860 show source open 861 This setting, which is on by default, controls whether GDB will try 862 to open source code files. Switching this off will stop GDB trying 863 to open and read source code files, which can be useful if the files 864 are located over a slow network connection. 865 866 set varsize-limit 867 show varsize-limit 868 These are now deprecated aliases for \\"set max-value-size\\" and 869 \\"show max-value-size\\". 870 871 task apply [all | TASK-IDS...] [FLAG]... COMMAND 872 Like \\"thread apply\\", but applies COMMAND to Ada tasks. 873 874 watch [...] task ID 875 Watchpoints can now be restricted to a specific Ada task. 876 877 maint set internal-error backtrace on|off 878 maint show internal-error backtrace 879 maint set internal-warning backtrace on|off 880 maint show internal-warning backtrace 881 GDB can now print a backtrace of itself when it encounters either an 882 internal-error, or an internal-warning. This is on by default for 883 internal-error and off by default for internal-warning. 884 885 set logging on|off 886 Deprecated and replaced by \\"set logging enabled on|off\\". 887 888 set logging enabled on|off 889 show logging enabled 890 These commands set or show whether logging is enabled or disabled. 891 892 exit 893 You can now exit GDB by using the new command \\"exit\\", in addition to 894 the existing \\"quit\\" command. 895 896 set debug threads on|off 897 show debug threads 898 Print additional debug messages about thread creation and deletion. 899 900 set debug linux-nat on|off 901 show debug linux-nat 902 These new commands replaced the old 'set debug lin-lwp' and 'show 903 debug lin-lwp' respectively. Turning this setting on prints debug 904 messages relating to GDB's handling of native Linux inferiors. 905 906 maint flush source-cache 907 Flush the contents of the source code cache. 908 909 maint set gnu-source-highlight enabled on|off 910 maint show gnu-source-highlight enabled 911 Whether GDB should use the GNU Source Highlight library for adding 912 styling to source code. When off, the library will not be used, even 913 when available. When GNU Source Highlight isn't used, or can't add 914 styling to a particular source file, then the Python Pygments 915 library will be used instead. 916 917 set suppress-cli-notifications (on|off) 918 show suppress-cli-notifications 919 This controls whether printing the notifications is suppressed for CLI. 920 CLI notifications occur when you change the selected context 921 (i.e., the current inferior, thread and/or the frame), or when 922 the program being debugged stops (e.g., because of hitting a 923 breakpoint, completing source-stepping, an interrupt, etc.). 924 925 set style disassembler enabled on|off 926 show style disassembler enabled 927 If GDB is compiled with Python support, and the Python Pygments 928 package is available, then, when this setting is on, disassembler 929 output will have styling applied. 930 931 set ada source-charset 932 show ada source-charset 933 Set the character set encoding that is assumed for Ada symbols. Valid 934 values for this follow the values that can be passed to the GNAT 935 compiler via the '-gnati' option. The default is ISO-8859-1. 936 937 tui layout 938 tui focus 939 tui refresh 940 tui window height 941 These are the new names for the old 'layout', 'focus', 'refresh', 942 and 'winheight' tui commands respectively. The old names still 943 exist as aliases to these new commands. 944 945 tui window width 946 winwidth 947 The new command 'tui window width', and the alias 'winwidth' allow 948 the width of a tui window to be adjusted when windows are laid out 949 in horizontal mode. 950 951 set debug tui on|off 952 show debug tui 953 Control the display of debug output about GDB's tui. 954 955 * Changed commands 956 957 print 958 Printing of floating-point values with base-modifying formats like 959 /x has been changed to display the underlying bytes of the value in 960 the desired base. This was GDB's documented behavior, but was never 961 implemented correctly. 962 963 maint packet 964 This command can now print a reply, if the reply includes 965 non-printable characters. Any non-printable characters are printed 966 as escaped hex, e.g. x?? where '??' is replaces with the value of 967 the non-printable character. 968 969 clone-inferior 970 The clone-inferior command now ensures that the TTY, CMD and ARGS 971 settings are copied from the original inferior to the new one. 972 All modifications to the environment variables done using the 'set 973 environment' or 'unset environment' commands are also copied to the new 974 inferior. 975 976 set debug lin-lwp on|off 977 show debug lin-lwp 978 These commands have been removed from GDB. The new command 'set 979 debug linux-nat' and 'show debug linux-nat' should be used 980 instead. 981 982 info win 983 This command now includes information about the width of the tui 984 windows in its output. 985 986 layout 987 focus 988 refresh 989 winheight 990 These commands are now aliases for the 'tui layout', 'tui focus', 991 'tui refresh', and 'tui window height' commands respectively. 992 993 * GDB's Ada parser now supports an extension for specifying the exact 994 byte contents of a floating-point literal. This can be useful for 995 setting floating-point registers to a precise value without loss of 996 precision. The syntax is an extension of the based literal syntax. 997 Use, e.g., \\"16lf#0123abcd#\\" -- the number of \\"l\\"s controls the width 998 of the floating-point type, and the \\"f\\" is the marker for floating 999 point. 1000 1001 * MI changes 1002 1003 ** The '-add-inferior' with no option flags now inherits the 1004 connection of the current inferior, this restores the behaviour of 1005 GDB as it was prior to GDB 10. 1006 1007 ** The '-add-inferior' command now accepts a '--no-connection' 1008 option, which causes the new inferior to start without a 1009 connection. 1010 1011 ** The default version of the MI interpreter is now 4 (-i=mi4). 1012 1013 ** The \\"script\\" field in breakpoint output (which is syntactically 1014 incorrect in MI 3 and below) has changed in MI 4 to become a list. 1015 This affects the following commands and events: 1016 1017 - -break-insert 1018 - -break-info 1019 - =breakpoint-created 1020 - =breakpoint-modified 1021 1022 The -fix-breakpoint-script-output command can be used to enable 1023 this behavior with previous MI versions. 1024 1025 * New targets 1026 1027 GNU/Linux/LoongArch loongarch*-*-linux* 1028 1029 * Removed targets 1030 1031 S+core score-*-* 1032 1033 * Python API 1034 1035 ** New function gdb.add_history(), which takes a gdb.Value object 1036 and adds the value it represents to GDB's history list. An 1037 integer, the index of the new item in the history list, is 1038 returned. 1039 1040 ** New function gdb.history_count(), which returns the number of 1041 values in GDB's value history. 1042 1043 ** New gdb.events.gdb_exiting event. This event is called with a 1044 gdb.GdbExitingEvent object which has the read-only attribute 1045 'exit_code', which contains the value of the GDB exit code. This 1046 event is triggered once GDB decides it is going to exit, but 1047 before GDB starts to clean up its internal state. 1048 1049 ** New function gdb.architecture_names(), which returns a list 1050 containing all of the possible Architecture.name() values. Each 1051 entry is a string. 1052 1053 ** New function gdb.Architecture.integer_type(), which returns an 1054 integer type given a size and a signed-ness. 1055 1056 ** New gdb.TargetConnection object type that represents a connection 1057 (as displayed by the 'info connections' command). A sub-class, 1058 gdb.RemoteTargetConnection, is used to represent 'remote' and 1059 'extended-remote' connections. 1060 1061 ** The gdb.Inferior type now has a 'connection' property which is an 1062 instance of gdb.TargetConnection, the connection used by this 1063 inferior. This can be None if the inferior has no connection. 1064 1065 ** New 'gdb.events.connection_removed' event registry, which emits a 1066 'gdb.ConnectionEvent' when a connection is removed from GDB. 1067 This event has a 'connection' property, a gdb.TargetConnection 1068 object for the connection being removed. 1069 1070 ** New gdb.connections() function that returns a list of all 1071 currently active connections. 1072 1073 ** New gdb.RemoteTargetConnection.send_packet(PACKET) method. This 1074 is equivalent to the existing 'maint packet' CLI command; it 1075 allows a user specified packet to be sent to the remote target. 1076 1077 ** New function gdb.host_charset(), returns a string, which is the 1078 name of the current host charset. 1079 1080 ** New gdb.set_parameter(NAME, VALUE). This sets the gdb parameter 1081 NAME to VALUE. 1082 1083 ** New gdb.with_parameter(NAME, VALUE). This returns a context 1084 manager that temporarily sets the gdb parameter NAME to VALUE, 1085 then resets it when the context is exited. 1086 1087 ** The gdb.Value.format_string method now takes a 'styling' 1088 argument, which is a boolean. When true, the returned string can 1089 include escape sequences to apply styling. The styling will only 1090 be present if styling is otherwise turned on in GDB (see 'help 1091 set styling'). When false, which is the default if the argument 1092 is not given, then no styling is applied to the returned string. 1093 1094 ** New read-only attribute gdb.InferiorThread.details, which is 1095 either a string, containing additional, target specific thread 1096 state information, or None, if there is no such additional 1097 information. 1098 1099 ** New read-only attribute gdb.Type.is_scalar, which is True for 1100 scalar types, and False for all other types. 1101 1102 ** New read-only attribute gdb.Type.is_signed. This attribute 1103 should only be read when Type.is_scalar is True, and will be True 1104 for signed types, and False for all other types. Attempting to 1105 read this attribute for non-scalar types will raise a ValueError. 1106 1107 ** It is now possible to add GDB/MI commands implemented in Python. 1108 1109 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 1110 1111 ** GDBserver is now supported on OpenRISC GNU/Linux. 1112 1113 * New native configurations 1114 1115 GNU/Linux/OpenRISC or1k*-*-linux* 1116 1117 *** Changes in GDB 11 1118 1119 * The 'set disassembler-options' command now supports specifying options 1120 for the ARC target. 1121 1122 * GDB now supports general memory tagging functionality if the underlying 1123 architecture supports the proper primitives and hooks. Currently this is 1124 enabled only for AArch64 MTE. 1125 1126 This includes: 1127 1128 - Additional information when the inferior crashes with a SIGSEGV caused by 1129 a memory tag violation. 1130 1131 - A new modifier 'm' for the \\"x\\" command, which displays allocation tags for a 1132 particular memory range. 1133 1134 - Display of memory tag mismatches by \\"print\\", for addresses and 1135 pointers, if memory tagging is supported by the architecture. 1136 1137 * Building GDB now requires GMP (The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic 1138 Library). 1139 1140 * MI changes 1141 1142 ** '-break-insert --qualified' and '-dprintf-insert --qualified' 1143 1144 The MI -break-insert and -dprintf-insert commands now support a 1145 new \\"--qualified\\" option that makes GDB interpret a specified 1146 function name as a complete fully-qualified name. This is the 1147 equivalent of the CLI's \\"break -qualified\\" and \\"dprintf 1148 -qualified\\". 1149 1150 ** '-break-insert --force-condition' and '-dprintf-insert --force-condition' 1151 1152 The MI -break-insert and -dprintf-insert commands now support a 1153 '--force-condition' flag to forcibly define a condition even when 1154 the condition is invalid at all locations of the breakpoint. This 1155 is equivalent to the '-force-condition' flag of the CLI's \\"break\\" 1156 command. 1157 1158 ** '-break-condition --force' 1159 1160 The MI -break-condition command now supports a '--force' flag to 1161 forcibly define a condition even when the condition is invalid at 1162 all locations of the selected breakpoint. This is equivalent to 1163 the '-force' flag of the CLI's \\"cond\\" command. 1164 1165 ** '-file-list-exec-source-files [--group-by-objfile] 1166 [--basename | --dirname] 1167 [--] [REGEXP]' 1168 1169 The existing -file-list-exec-source-files command now takes an 1170 optional REGEXP which is used to filter the source files that are 1171 included in the results. 1172 1173 By default REGEXP is matched against the full filename of the 1174 source file. When one of --basename or --dirname is given then 1175 REGEXP is only matched against the specified part of the full 1176 source filename. 1177 1178 When the optional --group-by-objfile flag is used the output 1179 format is changed, the results are now a list of object files 1180 (executable and libraries) with the source files that are 1181 associated with each object file. 1182 1183 The results from -file-list-exec-source-files now include a 1184 'debug-fully-read' field which takes the value 'true' or 'false'. 1185 A 'true' value indicates the source file is from a compilation 1186 unit that has had its debug information fully read in by GDB, a 1187 value of 'false' indicates GDB has only performed a partial scan 1188 of the debug information so far. 1189 1190 * GDB now supports core file debugging for x86_64 Cygwin programs. 1191 1192 * GDB will now look for the .gdbinit file in a config directory before 1193 looking for ~/.gdbinit. The file is searched for in the following 1194 locations: XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdb/gdbinit, HOME/.config/gdb/gdbinit, 1195 HOME/.gdbinit. On Apple hosts the search order is instead: 1196 HOME/Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbinit, HOME/.gdbinit. 1197 1198 * GDB now supports fixed point types which are described in DWARF 1199 as base types with a fixed-point encoding. Additionally, support 1200 for the DW_AT_GNU_numerator and DW_AT_GNU_denominator has also 1201 been added. 1202 1203 For Ada, this allows support for fixed point types without requiring 1204 the use of the GNAT encoding (based on information added to the type's 1205 name following a GNAT-specific format). 1206 1207 * GDB will now load and process commands from ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit 1208 or ~/.gdbearlyinit if these files are present. These files are 1209 processed earlier than any of the other initialization files and 1210 can affect parts of GDB's startup that previously had already been 1211 completed before the initialization files were read, for example 1212 styling of the initial GDB greeting. 1213 1214 * GDB now has two new options \\"--early-init-command\\" and 1215 \\"--early-init-eval-command\\" with corresponding short options \\"-eix\\" 1216 and \\"-eiex\\" that allow options (that would normally appear in a 1217 gdbearlyinit file) to be passed on the command line. 1218 1219 * For RISC-V targets, the target feature \\"org.gnu.gdb.riscv.vector\\" is 1220 now understood by GDB, and can be used to describe the vector 1221 registers of a target. The precise requirements of this register 1222 feature are documented in the GDB manual. 1223 1224 * For ARM targets, the \\"org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile-mve\\" feature is now 1225 supported by GDB and describes a new VPR register from the ARM MVE 1226 (Helium) extension. See the GDB manual for more information. 1227 1228 * TUI improvements 1229 1230 ** TUI windows now support mouse actions. The mouse wheel scrolls 1231 the appropriate window. 1232 1233 ** Key combinations that do not have a specific action on the 1234 focused window are passed to GDB. For example, you now can use 1235 Ctrl-Left/Ctrl-Right to move between words in the command window 1236 regardless of which window is in focus. Previously you would 1237 need to focus on the command window for such key combinations to 1238 work. 1239 1240 * New commands 1241 1242 set debug event-loop 1243 show debug event-loop 1244 Control the display of debug output about GDB's event loop. 1245 1246 set print memory-tag-violations 1247 show print memory-tag-violations 1248 Control whether to display additional information about memory tag violations 1249 when printing pointers and addresses. Architecture support for memory 1250 tagging is required for this option to have an effect. 1251 1252 maintenance flush symbol-cache 1253 maintenance flush register-cache 1254 These new commands are equivalent to the already existing commands 1255 'maintenance flush-symbol-cache' and 'flushregs' respectively. 1256 1257 maintenance flush dcache 1258 A new command to flush the dcache. 1259 1260 maintenance info target-sections 1261 Print GDB's internal target sections table. 1262 1263 maintenance info jit 1264 Print the JIT code objects in the inferior known to GDB. 1265 1266 memory-tag show-logical-tag POINTER 1267 Print the logical tag for POINTER. 1268 memory-tag with-logical-tag POINTER TAG 1269 Print POINTER with logical tag TAG. 1270 memory-tag show-allocation-tag ADDRESS 1271 Print the allocation tag for ADDRESS. 1272 memory-tag set-allocation-tag ADDRESS LENGTH TAGS 1273 Set the allocation tag for [ADDRESS, ADDRESS + LENGTH) to TAGS. 1274 memory-tag check POINTER 1275 Validate that POINTER's logical tag matches the allocation tag. 1276 1277 set startup-quietly on|off 1278 show startup-quietly 1279 When 'on', this causes GDB to act as if \\"-silent\\" were passed on the 1280 command line. This command needs to be added to an early 1281 initialization file (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit) in order to 1282 affect GDB. 1283 1284 set print type hex on|off 1285 show print type hex 1286 When 'on', the 'ptype' command uses hexadecimal notation to print sizes 1287 and offsets of struct members. When 'off', decimal notation is used. 1288 1289 set python ignore-environment on|off 1290 show python ignore-environment 1291 When 'on', this causes GDB's builtin Python to ignore any 1292 environment variables that would otherwise affect how Python 1293 behaves. This command needs to be added to an early initialization 1294 file (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit) in order to affect GDB. 1295 1296 set python dont-write-bytecode auto|on|off 1297 show python dont-write-bytecode 1298 When 'on', this causes GDB's builtin Python to not write any 1299 byte-code (.pyc files) to disk. This command needs to be added to 1300 an early initialization file (e.g. ~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit) in 1301 order to affect GDB. When 'off' byte-code will always be written. 1302 When set to 'auto' (the default) Python will check the 1303 PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable. 1304 1305 * Changed commands 1306 1307 break [PROBE_MODIFIER] [LOCATION] [thread THREADNUM] 1308 [-force-condition] [if CONDITION] 1309 This command would previously refuse setting a breakpoint if the 1310 CONDITION expression is invalid at a location. It now accepts and 1311 defines the breakpoint if there is at least one location at which 1312 the CONDITION is valid. The locations for which the CONDITION is 1313 invalid, are automatically disabled. If CONDITION is invalid at all 1314 of the locations, setting the breakpoint is still rejected. However, 1315 the '-force-condition' flag can be used in this case for forcing GDB to 1316 define the breakpoint, making all the current locations automatically 1317 disabled. This may be useful if the user knows the condition will 1318 become meaningful at a future location, e.g. due to a shared library 1319 load. 1320 1321 condition [-force] N COND 1322 The behavior of this command is changed the same way for the 'break' 1323 command as explained above. The '-force' flag can be used to force 1324 GDB into defining the condition even when COND is invalid for all the 1325 current locations of breakpoint N. 1326 1327 flushregs 1328 maintenance flush-symbol-cache 1329 These commands are deprecated in favor of the new commands 1330 'maintenance flush register-cache' and 'maintenance flush 1331 symbol-cache' respectively. 1332 1333 set style version foreground COLOR 1334 set style version background COLOR 1335 set style version intensity VALUE 1336 Control the styling of GDB's version number text. 1337 1338 inferior [ID] 1339 When the ID parameter is omitted, then this command prints information 1340 about the current inferior. When the ID parameter is present, the 1341 behavior of the command is unchanged and have the inferior ID become 1342 the current inferior. 1343 1344 maintenance info sections 1345 The ALLOBJ keyword has been replaced with an -all-objects command 1346 line flag. It is now possible to filter which sections are printed 1347 even when -all-objects is passed. 1348 1349 ptype[/FLAGS] TYPE | EXPRESSION 1350 The 'ptype' command has two new flags. When '/x' is set, hexadecimal 1351 notation is used when printing sizes and offsets of struct members. 1352 When '/d' is set, decimal notation is used when printing sizes and 1353 offsets of struct members. Default behavior is given by 'show print 1354 type hex'. 1355 1356 info sources 1357 The info sources command output has been restructured. The results 1358 are now based around a list of objfiles (executable and libraries), 1359 and for each objfile the source files that are part of that objfile 1360 are listed. 1361 1362 * Removed targets and native configurations 1363 1364 ARM Symbian arm*-*-symbianelf* 1365 1366 * New remote packets 1367 1368 qMemTags 1369 Request the remote to send allocation tags for a particular memory range. 1370 QMemTags 1371 Request the remote to store the specified allocation tags to the requested 1372 memory range. 1373 1374 * Guile API 1375 1376 ** Improved support for rvalue reference values: 1377 TYPE_CODE_RVALUE_REF is now exported as part of the API and the 1378 value-referenced-value procedure now handles rvalue reference 1379 values. 1380 1381 ** New procedures for obtaining value variants: 1382 value-reference-value, value-rvalue-reference-value and 1383 value-const-value. 1384 1385 ** Temporary breakpoints can now be created with make-breakpoint and 1386 tested for using breakpoint-temporary?. 1387 1388 * Python API 1389 1390 ** Inferior objects now contain a read-only 'connection_num' attribute that 1391 gives the connection number as seen in 'info connections' and 1392 'info inferiors'. 1393 1394 ** New method gdb.Frame.level() which returns the stack level of the 1395 frame object. 1396 1397 ** New method gdb.PendingFrame.level() which returns the stack level 1398 of the frame object. 1399 1400 ** When hitting a catchpoint, the Python API will now emit a 1401 gdb.BreakpointEvent rather than a gdb.StopEvent. The 1402 gdb.Breakpoint attached to the event will have type BP_CATCHPOINT. 1403 1404 ** Python TUI windows can now receive mouse click events. If the 1405 Window object implements the click method, it is called for each 1406 mouse click event in this window. 1407 1408 *** Changes in GDB 10 1409 1410 * There are new feature names for ARC targets: \\"org.gnu.gdb.arc.core\\" 1411 and \\"org.gnu.gdb.arc.aux\\". The old names are still supported but 1412 must be considered obsolete. They will be deprecated after some 1413 grace period. 1414 1415 * Help and apropos commands will now show the documentation of a 1416 command only once, even if that command has one or more aliases. 1417 These commands now show the command name, then all of its aliases, 1418 and finally the description of the command. 1419 1420 * 'help aliases' now shows only the user defined aliases. GDB predefined 1421 aliases are shown together with their aliased command. 1422 1423 * GDB now supports debuginfod, an HTTP server for distributing ELF/DWARF 1424 debugging information as well as source code. 1425 1426 When built with debuginfod, GDB can automatically query debuginfod 1427 servers for the separate debug files and source code of the executable 1428 being debugged. 1429 1430 To build GDB with debuginfod, pass --with-debuginfod to configure (this 1431 requires libdebuginfod, the debuginfod client library). 1432 1433 debuginfod is distributed with elfutils, starting with version 0.178. 1434 1435 You can get the latest version from https://sourceware.org/elfutils. 1436 1437 * Multi-target debugging support 1438 1439 GDB now supports debugging multiple target connections 1440 simultaneously. For example, you can now have each inferior 1441 connected to different remote servers running in different machines, 1442 or have one inferior debugging a local native process, an inferior 1443 debugging a core dump, etc. 1444 1445 This support is experimental and comes with some limitations -- you 1446 can only resume multiple targets simultaneously if all targets 1447 support non-stop mode, and all remote stubs or servers must support 1448 the same set of remote protocol features exactly. See also \\"info 1449 connections\\" and \\"add-inferior -no-connection\\" below, and \\"maint set 1450 target-non-stop\\" in the user manual. 1451 1452 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 1453 1454 ** GDBserver is now supported on ARC GNU/Linux. 1455 1456 ** GDBserver is now supported on RISC-V GNU/Linux. 1457 1458 ** GDBserver no longer supports these host triplets: 1459 1460 i[34567]86-*-lynxos* 1461 powerpc-*-lynxos* 1462 i[34567]86-*-nto* 1463 bfin-*-*linux* 1464 crisv32-*-linux* 1465 cris-*-linux* 1466 m32r*-*-linux* 1467 tilegx-*-linux* 1468 arm*-*-mingw32ce* 1469 i[34567]86-*-mingw32ce* 1470 1471 * Debugging MS-Windows processes now sets _exitsignal when the 1472 inferior is terminated by a signal, instead of setting _exitcode. 1473 1474 * Multithreaded symbol loading has now been enabled by default on systems 1475 that support it (see entry for GDB 9, below), providing faster 1476 performance for programs with many symbols. 1477 1478 * The _siginfo convenience variable now also works on Windows targets, 1479 and will display the EXCEPTION_RECORD of the last handled exception. 1480 1481 * TUI windows can now be arranged horizontally. 1482 1483 * The command history filename can now be set to the empty string 1484 either using 'set history filename' or by setting 'GDBHISTFILE=' in 1485 the environment. The effect of setting this filename to the empty 1486 string is that GDB will not try to load any previous command 1487 history. 1488 1489 * On Windows targets, it is now possible to debug 32-bit programs with a 1490 64-bit GDB. 1491 1492 * New commands 1493 1494 set exec-file-mismatch -- Set exec-file-mismatch handling (ask|warn|off). 1495 show exec-file-mismatch -- Show exec-file-mismatch handling (ask|warn|off). 1496 Set or show the option 'exec-file-mismatch'. When GDB attaches to a 1497 running process, this new option indicates whether to detect 1498 a mismatch between the current executable file loaded by GDB and the 1499 executable file used to start the process. If 'ask', the default, 1500 display a warning and ask the user whether to load the process 1501 executable file; if 'warn', just display a warning; if 'off', don't 1502 attempt to detect a mismatch. 1503 1504 tui new-layout NAME WINDOW WEIGHT [WINDOW WEIGHT]... 1505 Define a new TUI layout, specifying its name and the windows that 1506 will be displayed. 1507 1508 maintenance print xml-tdesc [FILE] 1509 Prints the current target description as an XML document. If the 1510 optional FILE is provided (which is an XML target description) then 1511 the target description is read from FILE into GDB, and then 1512 reprinted. 1513 1514 maintenance print core-file-backed-mappings 1515 Prints file-backed mappings loaded from a core file's note section. 1516 Output is expected to be similar to that of \\"info proc mappings\\". 1517 1518 set debug fortran-array-slicing on|off 1519 show debug fortran-array-slicing 1520 Print debugging when taking slices of Fortran arrays. 1521 1522 set fortran repack-array-slices on|off 1523 show fortran repack-array-slices 1524 When taking slices from Fortran arrays and strings, if the slice is 1525 non-contiguous within the original value then, when this option is 1526 on, the new value will be repacked into a single contiguous value. 1527 When this option is off, then the value returned will consist of a 1528 descriptor that describes the slice within the memory of the 1529 original parent value. 1530 1531 * Changed commands 1532 1533 alias [-a] [--] ALIAS = COMMAND [DEFAULT-ARGS...] 1534 The alias command can now specify default args for an alias. 1535 GDB automatically prepends the alias default args to the argument list 1536 provided explicitly by the user. 1537 For example, to have a backtrace with full details, you can define 1538 an alias 'bt_ALL' as 1539 'alias bt_ALL = backtrace -entry-values both -frame-arg all 1540 -past-main -past-entry -full'. 1541 Alias default arguments can also use a set of nested 'with' commands, 1542 e.g. 'alias pp10 = with print pretty -- with print elem 10 -- print' 1543 defines the alias pp10 that will pretty print a maximum of 10 elements 1544 of the given expression (if the expression is an array). 1545 1546 * New targets 1547 1548 GNU/Linux/RISC-V (gdbserver) riscv*-*-linux* 1549 BPF bpf-unknown-none 1550 Z80 z80-unknown-* 1551 1552 * Python API 1553 1554 ** gdb.register_window_type can be used to implement new TUI windows 1555 in Python. 1556 1557 ** Dynamic types can now be queried. gdb.Type has a new attribute, 1558 \\"dynamic\\", and gdb.Type.sizeof can be None for a dynamic type. A 1559 field of a dynamic type may have None for its \\"bitpos\\" attribute 1560 as well. 1561 1562 ** Commands written in Python can be in the \\"TUI\\" help class by 1563 registering with the new constant gdb.COMMAND_TUI. 1564 1565 ** New method gdb.PendingFrame.architecture () to retrieve the 1566 architecture of the pending frame. 1567 1568 ** New gdb.Architecture.registers method that returns a 1569 gdb.RegisterDescriptorIterator object, an iterator that returns 1570 gdb.RegisterDescriptor objects. The new RegisterDescriptor is a 1571 way to query the registers available for an architecture. 1572 1573 ** New gdb.Architecture.register_groups method that returns a 1574 gdb.RegisterGroupIterator object, an iterator that returns 1575 gdb.RegisterGroup objects. The new RegisterGroup is a way to 1576 discover the available register groups. 1577 1578 * Guile API 1579 1580 ** GDB can now be built with GNU Guile 3.0 and 2.2 in addition to 2.0. 1581 1582 ** Procedures 'memory-port-read-buffer-size', 1583 'set-memory-port-read-buffer-size!', 'memory-port-write-buffer-size', 1584 and 'set-memory-port-write-buffer-size!' are deprecated. When 1585 using Guile 2.2 and later, users who need to control the size of 1586 a memory port's internal buffer can use the 'setvbuf' procedure. 1587 1588 *** Changes in GDB 9 1589 1590 * 'thread-exited' event is now available in the annotations interface. 1591 1592 * New built-in convenience variables _gdb_major and _gdb_minor 1593 provide the GDB version. They are handy for conditionally using 1594 features available only in or since specific GDB versions, in 1595 scripts that should work error-free with many different versions, 1596 such as in system-wide init files. 1597 1598 * New built-in convenience functions _gdb_setting, _gdb_setting_str, 1599 _gdb_maint_setting and _gdb_maint_setting_str provide access to values 1600 of the GDB settings and the GDB maintenance settings. They are handy 1601 for changing the logic of user defined commands depending on the 1602 current GDB settings. 1603 1604 * GDB now supports Thread Local Storage (TLS) variables on several 1605 FreeBSD architectures (amd64, i386, powerpc, riscv). Other 1606 architectures require kernel changes. TLS is not yet supported for 1607 amd64 and i386 process core dumps. 1608 1609 * Support for Pointer Authentication (PAC) on AArch64 Linux. Return 1610 addresses that required unmasking are shown in the backtrace with the 1611 postfix [PAC]. 1612 1613 * Two new convenience functions _cimag and _creal that extract the 1614 imaginary and real parts respectively from complex numbers. 1615 1616 * New built-in convenience variables _shell_exitcode and _shell_exitsignal 1617 provide the exitcode or exit status of the shell commands launched by 1618 GDB commands such as \\"shell\\", \\"pipe\\" and \\"make\\". 1619 1620 * The command define-prefix can now define user defined prefix commands. 1621 User defined commands can now be defined using these user defined prefix 1622 commands. 1623 1624 * Command names can now use the . character. 1625 1626 * The RX port now supports XML target descriptions. 1627 1628 * GDB now shows the Ada task names at more places, e.g. in task switching 1629 messages. 1630 1631 * GDB can now be compiled with Python 3 on Windows. 1632 1633 * New convenience variable _ada_exception holds the address of the 1634 Ada exception being thrown. This is set by Ada-related catchpoints. 1635 1636 * GDB can now place breakpoints on nested functions and subroutines in 1637 Fortran code. The '::' operator can be used between parent and 1638 child scopes when placing breakpoints, for example: 1639 1640 (gdb) break outer_function::inner_function 1641 1642 The 'outer_function::' prefix is only needed if 'inner_function' is 1643 not visible in the current scope. 1644 1645 * In addition to the system-wide gdbinit file, if configured with 1646 --with-system-gdbinit-dir, GDB will now also load files in that directory 1647 as system gdbinit files, unless the -nx or -n flag is provided. Files 1648 with extensions .gdb, .py and .scm are supported as long as GDB was 1649 compiled with support for that language. 1650 1651 * GDB now supports multithreaded symbol loading for higher performance. 1652 This feature is still in testing, so it is disabled by default. You 1653 can turn it on using 'maint set worker-threads unlimited'. 1654 1655 * Python API 1656 1657 ** The gdb.Value type has a new method 'format_string' which returns a 1658 string representing the value. The formatting is controlled by the 1659 optional keyword arguments: 'raw', 'pretty_arrays', 'pretty_structs', 1660 'array_indexes', 'symbols', 'unions', 'deref_refs', 'actual_objects', 1661 'static_members', 'max_elements', 'repeat_threshold', and 'format'. 1662 1663 ** gdb.Type has a new property 'objfile' which returns the objfile the 1664 type was defined in. 1665 1666 ** The frame information printed by the python frame filtering code 1667 is now consistent with what the 'backtrace' command prints when 1668 there are no filters, or when the 'backtrace' '-no-filters' option 1669 is given. 1670 1671 ** The new function gdb.lookup_static_symbol can be used to look up 1672 symbols with static linkage. 1673 1674 ** The new function gdb.lookup_static_symbols can be used to look up 1675 all static symbols with static linkage. 1676 1677 ** gdb.Objfile has new methods 'lookup_global_symbol' and 1678 'lookup_static_symbol' to lookup a symbol from this objfile only. 1679 1680 ** gdb.Block now supports the dictionary syntax for accessing symbols in 1681 this block (e.g. block['local_variable']). 1682 1683 * New commands 1684 1685 | [COMMAND] | SHELL_COMMAND 1686 | -d DELIM COMMAND DELIM SHELL_COMMAND 1687 pipe [COMMAND] | SHELL_COMMAND 1688 pipe -d DELIM COMMAND DELIM SHELL_COMMAND 1689 Executes COMMAND and sends its output to SHELL_COMMAND. 1690 With no COMMAND, repeat the last executed command 1691 and send its output to SHELL_COMMAND. 1692 1693 define-prefix COMMAND 1694 Define or mark a command as a user-defined prefix command. 1695 1696 with SETTING [VALUE] [-- COMMAND] 1697 w SETTING [VALUE] [-- COMMAND] 1698 Temporarily set SETTING, run COMMAND, and restore SETTING. 1699 Usage: with SETTING -- COMMAND 1700 With no COMMAND, repeats the last executed command. 1701 SETTING is any GDB setting you can change with the \\"set\\" 1702 subcommands. For example, 'with language c -- print someobj' 1703 temporarily switches to the C language in order to print someobj. 1704 Settings can be combined: 'w lang c -- w print elements unlimited -- 1705 usercmd' switches to the C language and runs usercmd with no limit 1706 of array elements to print. 1707 1708 maint with SETTING [VALUE] [-- COMMAND] 1709 Like \\"with\\", but works with \\"maintenance set\\" settings. 1710 1711 set may-call-functions [on|off] 1712 show may-call-functions 1713 This controls whether GDB will attempt to call functions in 1714 the program, such as with expressions in the print command. It 1715 defaults to on. Calling functions in the program being debugged 1716 can have undesired side effects. It is now possible to forbid 1717 such function calls. If function calls are forbidden, GDB will throw 1718 an error when a command (such as print expression) calls a function 1719 in the program. 1720 1721 set print finish [on|off] 1722 show print finish 1723 This controls whether the \`finish' command will display the value 1724 that is returned by the current function. When \`off', the value is 1725 still entered into the value history, but it is not printed. The 1726 default is \`on'. 1727 1728 set print max-depth 1729 show print max-depth 1730 Allows deeply nested structures to be simplified when printing by 1731 replacing deeply nested parts (beyond the max-depth) with ellipses. 1732 The default max-depth is 20, but this can be set to unlimited to get 1733 the old behavior back. 1734 1735 set print raw-values [on|off] 1736 show print raw-values 1737 By default, GDB applies the enabled pretty printers when printing a 1738 value. This allows to ignore the enabled pretty printers for a series 1739 of commands. The default is 'off'. 1740 1741 set logging debugredirect [on|off] 1742 By default, GDB debug output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. 1743 Set if you want debug output to go only to the log file. 1744 1745 set style title foreground COLOR 1746 set style title background COLOR 1747 set style title intensity VALUE 1748 Control the styling of titles. 1749 1750 set style highlight foreground COLOR 1751 set style highlight background COLOR 1752 set style highlight intensity VALUE 1753 Control the styling of highlightings. 1754 1755 maint set worker-threads 1756 maint show worker-threads 1757 Control the number of worker threads that can be used by GDB. The 1758 default is 0. \\"unlimited\\" lets GDB choose a number that is 1759 reasonable. Currently worker threads are only used when demangling 1760 the names of linker symbols. 1761 1762 set style tui-border foreground COLOR 1763 set style tui-border background COLOR 1764 Control the styling of TUI borders. 1765 1766 set style tui-active-border foreground COLOR 1767 set style tui-active-border background COLOR 1768 Control the styling of the active TUI border. 1769 1770 maint set test-settings KIND 1771 maint show test-settings KIND 1772 A set of commands used by the testsuite for exercising the settings 1773 infrastructure. 1774 1775 maint set tui-resize-message [on|off] 1776 maint show tui-resize-message 1777 Control whether GDB prints a message each time the terminal is 1778 resized when in TUI mode. This is primarily useful for testing the 1779 TUI. 1780 1781 set print frame-info [short-location|location|location-and-address 1782 |source-and-location|source-line|auto] 1783 show print frame-info 1784 This controls what frame information is printed by the commands printing 1785 a frame. This setting will e.g. influence the behaviour of 'backtrace', 1786 'frame', 'stepi'. The python frame filtering also respect this setting. 1787 The 'backtrace' '-frame-info' option can override this global setting. 1788 1789 set tui compact-source 1790 show tui compact-source 1791 1792 Enable the \\"compact\\" display mode for the TUI source window. The 1793 compact display uses only as much space as is needed for the line 1794 numbers in the current file, and only a single space to separate the 1795 line numbers from the source. 1796 1797 info modules [-q] [REGEXP] 1798 Return a list of Fortran modules matching REGEXP, or all modules if 1799 no REGEXP is given. 1800 1801 info module functions [-q] [-m MODULE_REGEXP] [-t TYPE_REGEXP] [REGEXP] 1802 Return a list of functions within all modules, grouped by module. 1803 The list of functions can be restricted with the optional regular 1804 expressions. MODULE_REGEXP matches against the module name, 1805 TYPE_REGEXP matches against the function type signature, and REGEXP 1806 matches against the function name. 1807 1808 info module variables [-q] [-m MODULE_REGEXP] [-t TYPE_REGEXP] [REGEXP] 1809 Return a list of variables within all modules, grouped by module. 1810 The list of variables can be restricted with the optional regular 1811 expressions. MODULE_REGEXP matches against the module name, 1812 TYPE_REGEXP matches against the variable type, and REGEXP matches 1813 against the variable name. 1814 1815 set debug remote-packet-max-chars 1816 show debug remote-packet-max-chars 1817 Controls the number of characters to output in a remote packet when using 1818 \\"set debug remote\\". 1819 The default is 512 bytes. 1820 1821 info connections 1822 Lists the target connections currently in use. 1823 1824 * Changed commands 1825 1826 help 1827 The \\"help\\" command uses the title style to enhance the 1828 readibility of its output by styling the classes and 1829 command names. 1830 1831 apropos [-v] REGEXP 1832 Similarly to \\"help\\", the \\"apropos\\" command also uses the 1833 title style for the command names. \\"apropos\\" accepts now 1834 a flag \\"-v\\" (verbose) to show the full documentation 1835 of matching commands and to use the highlight style to mark 1836 the documentation parts matching REGEXP. 1837 1838 printf 1839 eval 1840 The GDB printf and eval commands can now print C-style and Ada-style 1841 string convenience variables without calling functions in the program. 1842 This allows to do formatted printing of strings without having 1843 a running inferior, or when debugging a core dump. 1844 1845 info sources [-dirname | -basename] [--] [REGEXP] 1846 This command has now optional arguments to only print the files 1847 whose names match REGEXP. The arguments -dirname and -basename 1848 allow to restrict matching respectively to the dirname and basename 1849 parts of the files. 1850 1851 show style 1852 The \\"show style\\" and its subcommands are now styling 1853 a style name in their output using its own style, to help 1854 the user visualize the different styles. 1855 1856 set print frame-arguments 1857 The new value 'presence' indicates to only indicate the presence of 1858 arguments using ..., instead of printing argument names and values. 1859 1860 set print raw-frame-arguments 1861 show print raw-frame-arguments 1862 1863 These commands replace the similarly-named \\"set/show print raw 1864 frame-arguments\\" commands (now with a dash instead of a space). The 1865 old commands are now deprecated and may be removed in a future 1866 release. 1867 1868 add-inferior [-no-connection] 1869 The add-inferior command now supports a \\"-no-connection\\" flag that 1870 makes the new inferior start with no target connection associated. 1871 By default, the new inferior inherits the target connection of the 1872 current inferior. See also \\"info connections\\". 1873 1874 info inferior 1875 This command's output now includes a new \\"Connection\\" column 1876 indicating which target connection an inferior is bound to. See 1877 \\"info connections\\" above. 1878 1879 maint test-options require-delimiter 1880 maint test-options unknown-is-error 1881 maint test-options unknown-is-operand 1882 maint show test-options-completion-result 1883 Commands used by the testsuite to validate the command options 1884 framework. 1885 1886 focus, winheight, +, -, >, < 1887 These commands are now case-sensitive. 1888 1889 * New command options, command completion 1890 1891 GDB now has a standard infrastructure to support dash-style command 1892 options ('-OPT'). One benefit is that commands that use it can 1893 easily support completion of command line arguments. Try \\"CMD 1894 -[TAB]\\" or \\"help CMD\\" to find options supported by a command. Over 1895 time, we intend to migrate most commands to this infrastructure. A 1896 number of commands got support for new command options in this 1897 release: 1898 1899 ** The \\"print\\" and \\"compile print\\" commands now support a number of 1900 options that allow overriding relevant global print settings as 1901 set by \\"set print\\" subcommands: 1902 1903 -address [on|off] 1904 -array [on|off] 1905 -array-indexes [on|off] 1906 -elements NUMBER|unlimited 1907 -null-stop [on|off] 1908 -object [on|off] 1909 -pretty [on|off] 1910 -raw-values [on|off] 1911 -repeats NUMBER|unlimited 1912 -static-members [on|off] 1913 -symbol [on|off] 1914 -union [on|off] 1915 -vtbl [on|off] 1916 1917 Note that because the \\"print\\"/\\"compile print\\" commands accept 1918 arbitrary expressions which may look like options (including 1919 abbreviations), if you specify any command option, then you must 1920 use a double dash (\\"--\\") to mark the end of argument processing. 1921 1922 ** The \\"backtrace\\" command now supports a number of options that 1923 allow overriding relevant global print settings as set by \\"set 1924 backtrace\\" and \\"set print\\" subcommands: 1925 1926 -entry-values no|only|preferred|if-needed|both|compact|default 1927 -frame-arguments all|scalars|none 1928 -raw-frame-arguments [on|off] 1929 -frame-info auto|source-line|location|source-and-location 1930 |location-and-address|short-location 1931 -past-main [on|off] 1932 -past-entry [on|off] 1933 1934 In addition, the full/no-filters/hide qualifiers are now also 1935 exposed as command options too: 1936 1937 -full 1938 -no-filters 1939 -hide 1940 1941 ** The \\"frame apply\\", \\"tfaas\\" and \\"faas\\" commands similarly now 1942 support the following options: 1943 1944 -past-main [on|off] 1945 -past-entry [on|off] 1946 1947 ** The new \\"info sources\\" options -dirname and -basename options 1948 are using the standard '-OPT' infrastructure. 1949 1950 All options above can also be abbreviated. The argument of boolean 1951 (on/off) options can be 0/1 too, and also the argument is assumed 1952 \\"on\\" if omitted. This allows writing compact command invocations, 1953 like for example: 1954 1955 (gdb) p -ra -p -o 0 -- *myptr 1956 1957 The above is equivalent to: 1958 1959 (gdb) print -raw-values -pretty -object off -- *myptr 1960 1961 ** The \\"info types\\" command now supports the '-q' flag to disable 1962 printing of some header information in a similar fashion to \\"info 1963 variables\\" and \\"info functions\\". 1964 1965 ** The \\"info variables\\", \\"info functions\\", and \\"whereis\\" commands 1966 now take a '-n' flag that excludes non-debug symbols (symbols 1967 from the symbol table, not from the debug info such as DWARF) 1968 from the results. 1969 1970 * Completion improvements 1971 1972 ** GDB can now complete the options of the \\"thread apply all\\" and 1973 \\"taas\\" commands, and their \\"-ascending\\" option can now be 1974 abbreviated. 1975 1976 ** GDB can now complete the options of the \\"info threads\\", \\"info 1977 functions\\", \\"info variables\\", \\"info locals\\", and \\"info args\\" 1978 commands. 1979 1980 ** GDB can now complete the options of the \\"compile file\\" and 1981 \\"compile code\\" commands. The \\"compile file\\" command now 1982 completes on filenames. 1983 1984 ** GDB can now complete the backtrace command's 1985 \\"full/no-filters/hide\\" qualifiers. 1986 1987 * In settings, you can now abbreviate \\"unlimited\\". 1988 1989 E.g., \\"set print elements u\\" is now equivalent to \\"set print 1990 elements unlimited\\". 1991 1992 * New MI commands 1993 1994 -complete 1995 This lists all the possible completions for the rest of the line, if it 1996 were to be given as a command itself. This is intended for use by MI 1997 frontends in cases when separate CLI and MI channels cannot be used. 1998 1999 -catch-throw, -catch-rethrow, and -catch-catch 2000 These can be used to catch C++ exceptions in a similar fashion to 2001 the CLI commands 'catch throw', 'catch rethrow', and 'catch catch'. 2002 2003 -symbol-info-functions, -symbol-info-types, and -symbol-info-variables 2004 These commands are the MI equivalent of the CLI commands 'info 2005 functions', 'info types', and 'info variables' respectively. 2006 2007 -symbol-info-modules, this is the MI equivalent of the CLI 'info 2008 modules' command. 2009 2010 -symbol-info-module-functions and -symbol-info-module-variables. 2011 These commands are the MI equivalent of the CLI commands 'info 2012 module functions' and 'info module variables'. 2013 2014 * Other MI changes 2015 2016 ** The default version of the MI interpreter is now 3 (-i=mi3). 2017 2018 ** The output of information about multi-location breakpoints (which is 2019 syntactically incorrect in MI 2) has changed in MI 3. This affects 2020 the following commands and events: 2021 2022 - -break-insert 2023 - -break-info 2024 - =breakpoint-created 2025 - =breakpoint-modified 2026 2027 The -fix-multi-location-breakpoint-output command can be used to enable 2028 this behavior with previous MI versions. 2029 2030 ** Backtraces and frames include a new optional field addr_flags which is 2031 given after the addr field. On AArch64 this contains PAC if the address 2032 has been masked in the frame. On all other targets the field is not 2033 present. 2034 2035 * Testsuite 2036 2037 The testsuite now creates the files gdb.cmd (containing the arguments 2038 used to launch GDB) and gdb.in (containing all the commands sent to 2039 GDB) in the output directory for each test script. Multiple invocations 2040 are appended with .1, .2, .3 etc. 2041 2042 * Building GDB and GDBserver now requires GNU make >= 3.82. 2043 2044 Using another implementation of the make program or an earlier version of 2045 GNU make to build GDB or GDBserver is not supported. 2046 2047 * Building GDB now requires GNU readline >= 7.0. 2048 2049 GDB now bundles GNU readline 8.0, but if you choose to use 2050 --with-system-readline, only readline >= 7.0 can be used. 2051 2052 * The TUI SingleKey keymap is now named \\"SingleKey\\". This can be used 2053 from .inputrc to bind keys in this keymap. This feature is only 2054 available when gdb is built against GNU readline 8.0 or later. 2055 2056 * Removed targets and native configurations 2057 2058 GDB no longer supports debugging the Cell Broadband Engine. This includes 2059 both debugging standalone Cell/B.E. SPU applications and integrated debugging 2060 of Cell/B.E. applications that use both the PPU and SPU architectures. 2061 2062 * New Simulators 2063 2064 TI PRU pru-*-elf 2065 2066 * Removed targets and native configurations 2067 2068 Solaris 10 i?86-*-solaris2.10, x86_64-*-solaris2.10, 2069 sparc*-*-solaris2.10 2070 2071 *** Changes in GDB 8.3 2072 2073 * GDB and GDBserver now support access to additional registers on 2074 PowerPC GNU/Linux targets: PPR, DSCR, TAR, EBB/PMU registers, and 2075 HTM registers. 2076 2077 * GDB now has experimental support for the compilation and injection of 2078 C++ source code into the inferior. This beta release does not include 2079 support for several language features, such as templates, constructors, 2080 and operators. 2081 2082 This feature requires GCC 7.1 or higher built with libcp1.so 2083 (the C++ plug-in). 2084 2085 * GDB and GDBserver now support IPv6 connections. IPv6 addresses 2086 can be passed using the '[ADDRESS]:PORT' notation, or the regular 2087 'ADDRESS:PORT' method. 2088 2089 * DWARF index cache: GDB can now automatically save indices of DWARF 2090 symbols on disk to speed up further loading of the same binaries. 2091 2092 * Ada task switching is now supported on aarch64-elf targets when 2093 debugging a program using the Ravenscar Profile. For more information, 2094 see the \\"Tasking Support when using the Ravenscar Profile\\" section 2095 in the GDB user manual. 2096 2097 * GDB in batch mode now exits with status 1 if the last command to be 2098 executed failed. 2099 2100 * The RISC-V target now supports target descriptions. 2101 2102 * System call catchpoints now support system call aliases on FreeBSD. 2103 When the ABI of a system call changes in FreeBSD, this is 2104 implemented by leaving a compatibility system call using the old ABI 2105 at the existing number and allocating a new system call number for 2106 the new ABI. For example, FreeBSD 12 altered the layout of 'struct 2107 kevent' used by the 'kevent' system call. As a result, FreeBSD 12 2108 kernels ship with both 'kevent' and 'freebsd11_kevent' system calls. 2109 The 'freebsd11_kevent' system call is assigned an alias of 'kevent' 2110 so that a system call catchpoint for the 'kevent' system call will 2111 catch invocations of both the 'kevent' and 'freebsd11_kevent' 2112 binaries. This ensures that 'kevent' system calls are caught for 2113 binaries using either the old or new ABIs. 2114 2115 * Terminal styling is now available for the CLI and the TUI. GNU 2116 Source Highlight can additionally be used to provide styling of 2117 source code snippets. See the \\"set style\\" commands, below, for more 2118 information. 2119 2120 * Removed support for old demangling styles arm, edg, gnu, hp and 2121 lucid. 2122 2123 * New commands 2124 2125 set debug compile-cplus-types 2126 show debug compile-cplus-types 2127 Control the display of debug output about type conversion in the 2128 C++ compile feature. Commands have no effect while compiling 2129 for other languages. 2130 2131 set debug skip 2132 show debug skip 2133 Control whether debug output about files/functions skipping is 2134 displayed. 2135 2136 frame apply [all | COUNT | -COUNT | level LEVEL...] [FLAG]... COMMAND 2137 Apply a command to some frames. 2138 FLAG arguments allow to control what output to produce and how to handle 2139 errors raised when applying COMMAND to a frame. 2140 2141 taas COMMAND 2142 Apply a command to all threads (ignoring errors and empty output). 2143 Shortcut for 'thread apply all -s COMMAND'. 2144 2145 faas COMMAND 2146 Apply a command to all frames (ignoring errors and empty output). 2147 Shortcut for 'frame apply all -s COMMAND'. 2148 2149 tfaas COMMAND 2150 Apply a command to all frames of all threads (ignoring errors and empty 2151 output). 2152 Shortcut for 'thread apply all -s frame apply all -s COMMAND'. 2153 2154 maint set dwarf unwinders (on|off) 2155 maint show dwarf unwinders 2156 Control whether DWARF unwinders can be used. 2157 2158 info proc files 2159 Display a list of open files for a process. 2160 2161 * Changed commands 2162 2163 Changes to the \\"frame\\", \\"select-frame\\", and \\"info frame\\" CLI commands. 2164 These commands all now take a frame specification which 2165 is either a frame level, or one of the keywords 'level', 'address', 2166 'function', or 'view' followed by a parameter. Selecting a frame by 2167 address, or viewing a frame outside the current backtrace now 2168 requires the use of a keyword. Selecting a frame by level is 2169 unchanged. The MI comment \\"-stack-select-frame\\" is unchanged. 2170 2171 target remote FILENAME 2172 target extended-remote FILENAME 2173 If FILENAME is a Unix domain socket, GDB will attempt to connect 2174 to this socket instead of opening FILENAME as a character device. 2175 2176 info args [-q] [-t TYPEREGEXP] [NAMEREGEXP] 2177 info functions [-q] [-t TYPEREGEXP] [NAMEREGEXP] 2178 info locals [-q] [-t TYPEREGEXP] [NAMEREGEXP] 2179 info variables [-q] [-t TYPEREGEXP] [NAMEREGEXP] 2180 These commands can now print only the searched entities 2181 matching the provided regexp(s), giving a condition 2182 on the entity names or entity types. The flag -q disables 2183 printing headers or informations messages. 2184 2185 info functions 2186 info types 2187 info variables 2188 rbreak 2189 These commands now determine the syntax for the shown entities 2190 according to the language chosen by \`set language'. In particular, 2191 \`set language auto' means to automatically choose the language of 2192 the shown entities. 2193 2194 thread apply [all | COUNT | -COUNT] [FLAG]... COMMAND 2195 The 'thread apply' command accepts new FLAG arguments. 2196 FLAG arguments allow to control what output to produce and how to handle 2197 errors raised when applying COMMAND to a thread. 2198 2199 set tui tab-width NCHARS 2200 show tui tab-width NCHARS 2201 \\"set tui tab-width\\" replaces the \\"tabset\\" command, which has been deprecated. 2202 2203 set style enabled [on|off] 2204 show style enabled 2205 Enable or disable terminal styling.

Source code styling is 2211 enabled by default, but only takes effect if styling in general is 2212 enabled, and if GDB was linked with GNU Source Highlight. 2213 2214 set style filename foreground COLOR 2215 set style filename background COLOR 2216 set style filename intensity VALUE 2217 Control the styling of file names. 2218 2219 set style function foreground COLOR 2220 set style function background COLOR 2221 set style function intensity VALUE 2222 Control the styling of function names. 2223 2224 set style variable foreground COLOR 2225 set style variable background COLOR 2226 set style variable intensity VALUE 2227 Control the styling of variable names. 2228 2229 set style address foreground COLOR 2230 set style address background COLOR 2231 set style address intensity VALUE 2232 Control the styling of addresses. 2233 2234 * MI changes 2235 2236 ** The '-data-disassemble' MI command now accepts an '-a' option to 2237 disassemble the whole function surrounding the given program 2238 counter value or function name. Support for this feature can be 2239 verified by using the \\"-list-features\\" command, which should 2240 contain \\"data-disassemble-a-option\\". 2241 2242 ** Command responses and notifications that include a frame now include 2243 the frame's architecture in a new \\"arch\\" attribute. 2244 2245 * New native configurations 2246 2247 GNU/Linux/RISC-V riscv*-*-linux* 2248 FreeBSD/riscv riscv*-*-freebsd* 2249 2250 * New targets 2251 2252 GNU/Linux/RISC-V riscv*-*-linux* 2253 CSKY ELF csky*-*-elf 2254 CSKY GNU/LINUX csky*-*-linux 2255 FreeBSD/riscv riscv*-*-freebsd* 2256 NXP S12Z s12z-*-elf 2257 GNU/Linux/OpenRISC or1k*-*-linux* 2258 2259 * Removed targets 2260 2261 GDB no longer supports native debugging on versions of MS-Windows 2262 before Windows XP. 2263 2264 * Python API 2265 2266 ** GDB no longer supports Python versions less than 2.6. 2267 2268 ** The gdb.Inferior type has a new 'progspace' property, which is the program 2269 space associated to that inferior. 2270 2271 ** The gdb.Progspace type has a new 'objfiles' method, which returns the list 2272 of objfiles associated to that program space. 2273 2274 ** gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_COMMON_BLOCK, gdb.SYMBOL_MODULE_DOMAIN, and 2275 gdb.SYMBOL_COMMON_BLOCK_DOMAIN were added to reflect changes to 2276 the gdb core. 2277 2278 ** gdb.SYMBOL_VARIABLES_DOMAIN, gdb.SYMBOL_FUNCTIONS_DOMAIN, and 2279 gdb.SYMBOL_TYPES_DOMAIN are now deprecated. These were never 2280 correct and did not work properly. 2281 2282 ** The gdb.Value type has a new constructor, which is used to construct a 2283 gdb.Value from a Python buffer object and a gdb.Type. 2284 2285 * Configure changes 2286 2287 --enable-ubsan 2288 2289 Enable or disable the undefined behavior sanitizer. This is 2290 disabled by default, but passing --enable-ubsan=yes or 2291 --enable-ubsan=auto to configure will enable it. Enabling this can 2292 cause a performance penalty. The undefined behavior sanitizer was 2293 first introduced in GCC 4.9. 2294 2295 *** Changes in GDB 8.2 2296 2297 * The 'set disassembler-options' command now supports specifying options 2298 for the MIPS target. 2299 2300 * The 'symbol-file' command now accepts an '-o' option to add a relative 2301 offset to all sections. 2302 2303 * Similarly, the 'add-symbol-file' command also accepts an '-o' option to add 2304 a relative offset to all sections, but it allows to override the load 2305 address of individual sections using '-s'. 2306 2307 * The 'add-symbol-file' command no longer requires the second argument 2308 (address of the text section). 2309 2310 * The endianness used with the 'set endian auto' mode in the absence of 2311 an executable selected for debugging is now the last endianness chosen 2312 either by one of the 'set endian big' and 'set endian little' commands 2313 or by inferring from the last executable used, rather than the startup 2314 default. 2315 2316 * The pager now allows a \\"c\\" response, meaning to disable the pager 2317 for the rest of the current command. 2318 2319 * The commands 'info variables/functions/types' now show the source line 2320 numbers of symbol definitions when available. 2321 2322 * 'info proc' now works on running processes on FreeBSD systems and core 2323 files created on FreeBSD systems. 2324 2325 * C expressions can now use _Alignof, and C++ expressions can now use 2326 alignof. 2327 2328 * Support for SVE on AArch64 Linux. Note that GDB does not detect changes to 2329 the vector length while the process is running. 2330 2331 * New commands 2332 2333 set debug fbsd-nat 2334 show debug fbsd-nat 2335 Control display of debugging info regarding the FreeBSD native target. 2336 2337 set|show varsize-limit 2338 This new setting allows the user to control the maximum size of Ada 2339 objects being printed when those objects have a variable type, 2340 instead of that maximum size being hardcoded to 65536 bytes. 2341 2342 set|show record btrace cpu 2343 Controls the processor to be used for enabling errata workarounds for 2344 branch trace decode. 2345 2346 maint check libthread-db 2347 Run integrity checks on the current inferior's thread debugging 2348 library 2349 2350 maint set check-libthread-db (on|off) 2351 maint show check-libthread-db 2352 Control whether to run integrity checks on inferior specific thread 2353 debugging libraries as they are loaded. The default is not to 2354 perform such checks. 2355 2356 * Python API 2357 2358 ** Type alignment is now exposed via the \\"align\\" attribute of a gdb.Type. 2359 2360 ** The commands attached to a breakpoint can be set by assigning to 2361 the breakpoint's \\"commands\\" field. 2362 2363 ** gdb.execute can now execute multi-line gdb commands. 2364 2365 ** The new functions gdb.convenience_variable and 2366 gdb.set_convenience_variable can be used to get and set the value 2367 of convenience variables. 2368 2369 ** A gdb.Parameter will no longer print the \\"set\\" help text on an 2370 ordinary \\"set\\"; instead by default a \\"set\\" will be silent unless 2371 the get_set_string method returns a non-empty string. 2372 2373 * New targets 2374 2375 RiscV ELF riscv*-*-elf 2376 2377 * Removed targets and native configurations 2378 2379 m88k running OpenBSD m88*-*-openbsd* 2380 SH-5/SH64 ELF sh64-*-elf*, SH-5/SH64 support in sh* 2381 SH-5/SH64 running GNU/Linux SH-5/SH64 support in sh*-*-linux* 2382 SH-5/SH64 running OpenBSD SH-5/SH64 support in sh*-*-openbsd* 2383 2384 * Aarch64/Linux hardware watchpoints improvements 2385 2386 Hardware watchpoints on unaligned addresses are now properly 2387 supported when running Linux kernel 4.10 or higher: read and access 2388 watchpoints are no longer spuriously missed, and all watchpoints 2389 lengths between 1 and 8 bytes are supported. On older kernels, 2390 watchpoints set on unaligned addresses are no longer missed, with 2391 the tradeoff that there is a possibility of false hits being 2392 reported. 2393 2394 * Configure changes 2395 2396 --enable-codesign=CERT 2397 This can be used to invoke \\"codesign -s CERT\\" after building gdb. 2398 This option is useful on macOS, where code signing is required for 2399 gdb to work properly. 2400 2401 --disable-gdbcli has been removed 2402 This is now silently accepted, but does nothing. 2403 2404 *** Changes in GDB 8.1 2405 2406 * GDB now supports dynamically creating arbitrary register groups specified 2407 in XML target descriptions. This allows for finer grain grouping of 2408 registers on systems with a large amount of registers. 2409 2410 * The 'ptype' command now accepts a '/o' flag, which prints the 2411 offsets and sizes of fields in a struct, like the pahole(1) tool. 2412 2413 * New \\"--readnever\\" command line option instructs GDB to not read each 2414 symbol file's symbolic debug information. This makes startup faster 2415 but at the expense of not being able to perform symbolic debugging. 2416 This option is intended for use cases where symbolic debugging will 2417 not be used, e.g., when you only need to dump the debuggee's core. 2418 2419 * GDB now uses the GNU MPFR library, if available, to emulate target 2420 floating-point arithmetic during expression evaluation when the target 2421 uses different floating-point formats than the host. At least version 2422 3.1 of GNU MPFR is required. 2423 2424 * GDB now supports access to the guarded-storage-control registers and the 2425 software-based guarded-storage broadcast control registers on IBM z14. 2426 2427 * On Unix systems, GDB now supports transmitting environment variables 2428 that are to be set or unset to GDBserver. These variables will 2429 affect the environment to be passed to the remote inferior. 2430 2431 To inform GDB of environment variables that are to be transmitted to 2432 GDBserver, use the \\"set environment\\" command. Only user set 2433 environment variables are sent to GDBserver. 2434 2435 To inform GDB of environment variables that are to be unset before 2436 the remote inferior is started by the GDBserver, use the \\"unset 2437 environment\\" command. 2438 2439 * Completion improvements 2440 2441 ** GDB can now complete function parameters in linespecs and 2442 explicit locations without quoting. When setting breakpoints, 2443 quoting around functions names to help with TAB-completion is 2444 generally no longer necessary. For example, this now completes 2445 correctly: 2446 2447 (gdb) b function(in[TAB] 2448 (gdb) b function(int) 2449 2450 Related, GDB is no longer confused with completing functions in 2451 C++ anonymous namespaces: 2452 2453 (gdb) b (anon[TAB] 2454 (gdb) b (anonymous namespace)::[TAB][TAB] 2455 (anonymous namespace)::a_function() 2456 (anonymous namespace)::b_function() 2457 2458 ** GDB now has much improved linespec and explicit locations TAB 2459 completion support, that better understands what you're 2460 completing and offers better suggestions. For example, GDB no 2461 longer offers data symbols as possible completions when you're 2462 setting a breakpoint. 2463 2464 ** GDB now TAB-completes label symbol names. 2465 2466 ** The \\"complete\\" command now mimics TAB completion accurately. 2467 2468 * New command line options (gcore) 2469 2470 -a 2471 Dump all memory mappings. 2472 2473 * Breakpoints on C++ functions are now set on all scopes by default 2474 2475 By default, breakpoints on functions/methods are now interpreted as 2476 specifying all functions with the given name ignoring missing 2477 leading scopes (namespaces and classes). 2478 2479 For example, assuming a C++ program with symbols named: 2480 2481 A::B::func() 2482 B::func() 2483 2484 both commands \\"break func()\\" and \\"break B::func()\\" set a breakpoint 2485 on both symbols. 2486 2487 You can use the new flag \\"-qualified\\" to override this. This makes 2488 GDB interpret the specified function name as a complete 2489 fully-qualified name instead. For example, using the same C++ 2490 program, the \\"break -q B::func\\" command sets a breakpoint on 2491 \\"B::func\\", only. A parameter has been added to the Python 2492 gdb.Breakpoint constructor to achieve the same result when creating 2493 a breakpoint from Python. 2494 2495 * Breakpoints on functions marked with C++ ABI tags 2496 2497 GDB can now set breakpoints on functions marked with C++ ABI tags 2498 (e.g., [abi:cxx11]). See here for a description of ABI tags: 2499 https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/ 2500 2501 Functions with a C++11 abi tag are demangled/displayed like this: 2502 2503 function[abi:cxx11](int) 2504 ^^^^^^^^^^^ 2505 2506 You can now set a breakpoint on such functions simply as if they had 2507 no tag, like: 2508 2509 (gdb) b function(int) 2510 2511 Or if you need to disambiguate between tags, like: 2512 2513 (gdb) b function[abi:other_tag](int) 2514 2515 Tab completion was adjusted accordingly as well. 2516 2517 * Python Scripting 2518 2519 ** New events gdb.new_inferior, gdb.inferior_deleted, and 2520 gdb.new_thread are emitted. See the manual for further 2521 description of these. 2522 2523 ** A new function, \\"gdb.rbreak\\" has been added to the Python API. 2524 This function allows the setting of a large number of breakpoints 2525 via a regex pattern in Python. See the manual for further details. 2526 2527 ** Python breakpoints can now accept explicit locations. See the 2528 manual for a further description of this feature. 2529 2530 2531 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 2532 2533 ** GDBserver is now able to start inferior processes with a 2534 specified initial working directory. 2535 2536 The user can set the desired working directory to be used from 2537 GDB using the new \\"set cwd\\" command. 2538 2539 ** New \\"--selftest\\" command line option runs some GDBserver self 2540 tests. These self tests are disabled in releases. 2541 2542 ** On Unix systems, GDBserver now does globbing expansion and variable 2543 substitution in inferior command line arguments. 2544 2545 This is done by starting inferiors using a shell, like GDB does. 2546 See \\"set startup-with-shell\\" in the user manual for how to disable 2547 this from GDB when using \\"target extended-remote\\". When using 2548 \\"target remote\\", you can disable the startup with shell by using the 2549 new \\"--no-startup-with-shell\\" GDBserver command line option. 2550 2551 ** On Unix systems, GDBserver now supports receiving environment 2552 variables that are to be set or unset from GDB. These variables 2553 will affect the environment to be passed to the inferior. 2554 2555 * When catching an Ada exception raised with a message, GDB now prints 2556 the message in the catchpoint hit notification. In GDB/MI mode, that 2557 information is provided as an extra field named \\"exception-message\\" 2558 in the *stopped notification. 2559 2560 * Trait objects can now be inspected When debugging Rust code. This 2561 requires compiler support which will appear in Rust 1.24. 2562 2563 * New remote packets 2564 2565 QEnvironmentHexEncoded 2566 Inform GDBserver of an environment variable that is to be passed to 2567 the inferior when starting it. 2568 2569 QEnvironmentUnset 2570 Inform GDBserver of an environment variable that is to be unset 2571 before starting the remote inferior. 2572 2573 QEnvironmentReset 2574 Inform GDBserver that the environment should be reset (i.e., 2575 user-set environment variables should be unset). 2576 2577 QStartupWithShell 2578 Indicates whether the inferior must be started with a shell or not. 2579 2580 QSetWorkingDir 2581 Tell GDBserver that the inferior to be started should use a specific 2582 working directory. 2583 2584 * The \\"maintenance print c-tdesc\\" command now takes an optional 2585 argument which is the file name of XML target description. 2586 2587 * The \\"maintenance selftest\\" command now takes an optional argument to 2588 filter the tests to be run. 2589 2590 * The \\"enable\\", and \\"disable\\" commands now accept a range of 2591 breakpoint locations, e.g. \\"enable 1.3-5\\". 2592 2593 * New commands 2594 2595 set|show cwd 2596 Set and show the current working directory for the inferior. 2597 2598 set|show compile-gcc 2599 Set and show compilation command used for compiling and injecting code 2600 with the 'compile' commands. 2601 2602 set debug separate-debug-file 2603 show debug separate-debug-file 2604 Control the display of debug output about separate debug file search. 2605 2606 set dump-excluded-mappings 2607 show dump-excluded-mappings 2608 Control whether mappings marked with the VM_DONTDUMP flag should be 2609 dumped when generating a core file. 2610 2611 maint info selftests 2612 List the registered selftests. 2613 2614 starti 2615 Start the debugged program stopping at the first instruction. 2616 2617 set|show debug or1k 2618 Control display of debugging messages related to OpenRISC targets. 2619 2620 set|show print type nested-type-limit 2621 Set and show the limit of nesting level for nested types that the 2622 type printer will show. 2623 2624 * TUI Single-Key mode now supports two new shortcut keys: \`i' for stepi and 2625 \`o' for nexti. 2626 2627 * Safer/improved support for debugging with no debug info 2628 2629 GDB no longer assumes functions with no debug information return 2630 'int'. 2631 2632 This means that GDB now refuses to call such functions unless you 2633 tell it the function's type, by either casting the call to the 2634 declared return type, or by casting the function to a function 2635 pointer of the right type, and calling that: 2636 2637 (gdb) p getenv (\\"PATH\\") 2638 'getenv' has unknown return type; cast the call to its declared return type 2639 (gdb) p (char *) getenv (\\"PATH\\") 2640 1 = 0x7fffffffe \\"/usr/local/bin:/\\"... 2641 (gdb) p ((char * (*) (const char *)) getenv) (\\"PATH\\") 2642 2 = 0x7fffffffe \\"/usr/local/bin:/\\"... 2643 2644 Similarly, GDB no longer assumes that global variables with no debug 2645 info have type 'int', and refuses to print the variable's value 2646 unless you tell it the variable's type: 2647 2648 (gdb) p var 2649 'var' has unknown type; cast it to its declared type 2650 (gdb) p (float) var 2651 3 = 3.14 2652 2653 * New native configurations 2654 2655 FreeBSD/aarch64 aarch64*-*-freebsd* 2656 FreeBSD/arm arm*-*-freebsd* 2657 2658 * New targets 2659 2660 FreeBSD/aarch64 aarch64*-*-freebsd* 2661 FreeBSD/arm arm*-*-freebsd* 2662 OpenRISC ELF or1k*-*-elf 2663 2664 * Removed targets and native configurations 2665 2666 Solaris 2.0-9 i?86-*-solaris2.[0-9], sparc*-*-solaris2.[0-9] 2667 2668 *** Changes in GDB 8.0 2669 2670 * GDB now supports access to the PKU register on GNU/Linux. The register is 2671 added by the Memory Protection Keys for Userspace feature which will be 2672 available in future Intel CPUs. 2673 2674 * GDB now supports C++11 rvalue references. 2675 2676 * Python Scripting 2677 2678 ** New functions to start, stop and access a running btrace recording. 2679 ** Rvalue references are now supported in gdb.Type. 2680 2681 * GDB now supports recording and replaying rdrand and rdseed Intel 64 2682 instructions. 2683 2684 * Building GDB and GDBserver now requires a C++11 compiler. 2685 2686 For example, GCC 4.8 or later. 2687 2688 It is no longer possible to build GDB or GDBserver with a C 2689 compiler. The --disable-build-with-cxx configure option has been 2690 removed. 2691 2692 * Building GDB and GDBserver now requires GNU make >= 3.81. 2693 2694 It is no longer supported to build GDB or GDBserver with another 2695 implementation of the make program or an earlier version of GNU make. 2696 2697 * Native debugging on MS-Windows supports command-line redirection 2698 2699 Command-line arguments used for starting programs on MS-Windows can 2700 now include redirection symbols supported by native Windows shells, 2701 such as '<', '>', '>>', '2>&1', etc. This affects GDB commands such 2702 as \\"run\\", \\"start\\", and \\"set args\\", as well as the corresponding MI 2703 features. 2704 2705 * Support for thread names on MS-Windows. 2706 2707 GDB now catches and handles the special exception that programs 2708 running on MS-Windows use to assign names to threads in the 2709 debugger. 2710 2711 * Support for Java programs compiled with gcj has been removed. 2712 2713 * User commands now accept an unlimited number of arguments. 2714 Previously, only up to 10 was accepted. 2715 2716 * The \\"eval\\" command now expands user-defined command arguments. 2717 2718 This makes it easier to process a variable number of arguments: 2719 2720 define mycommand 2721 set i = 0 2722 while i < argc 2723 eval \\"print arg%d\\", i 2724 set i = i + 1 2725 end 2726 end 2727 2728 * Target descriptions can now describe registers for sparc32 and sparc64. 2729 2730 * GDB now supports DWARF version 5 (debug information format). 2731 Its .debug_names index is not yet supported. 2732 2733 * New native configurations 2734 2735 FreeBSD/mips mips*-*-freebsd 2736 2737 * New targets 2738 2739 Synopsys ARC arc*-*-elf32 2740 FreeBSD/mips mips*-*-freebsd 2741 2742 * Removed targets and native configurations 2743 2744 Alpha running FreeBSD alpha*-*-freebsd* 2745 Alpha running GNU/kFreeBSD alpha*-*-kfreebsd*-gnu 2746 2747 * New commands 2748 2749 flash-erase 2750 Erases all the flash memory regions reported by the target. 2751 2752 maint print arc arc-instruction address 2753 Print internal disassembler information about instruction at a given address. 2754 2755 * New options 2756 2757 set disassembler-options 2758 show disassembler-options 2759 Controls the passing of target specific information to the disassembler. 2760 If it is necessary to specify more than one disassembler option then 2761 multiple options can be placed together into a comma separated list. 2762 The default value is the empty string. Currently, the only supported 2763 targets are ARM, PowerPC and S/390. 2764 2765 * New MI commands 2766 2767 -target-flash-erase 2768 Erases all the flash memory regions reported by the target. This is 2769 equivalent to the CLI command flash-erase. 2770 2771 -file-list-shared-libraries 2772 List the shared libraries in the program. This is 2773 equivalent to the CLI command \\"info shared\\". 2774 2775 -catch-handlers 2776 Catchpoints stopping the program when Ada exceptions are 2777 handled. This is equivalent to the CLI command \\"catch handlers\\". 2778 2779 *** Changes in GDB 7.12 2780 2781 * GDB and GDBserver now build with a C++ compiler by default. 2782 2783 The --enable-build-with-cxx configure option is now enabled by 2784 default. One must now explicitly configure with 2785 --disable-build-with-cxx in order to build with a C compiler. This 2786 option will be removed in a future release. 2787 2788 * GDBserver now supports recording btrace without maintaining an active 2789 GDB connection. 2790 2791 * GDB now supports a negative repeat count in the 'x' command to examine 2792 memory backward from the given address. For example: 2793 2794 (gdb) bt 2795 #0 Func1 (n=42, p=0x40061c \\"hogehoge\\") at main.cpp:4 2796 #1 0x400580 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe5c8) at main.cpp:8 2797 (gdb) x/-5i 0x0000000000400580 2798 0x40056a <main(int, char**)+8>: mov %edi,-0x4(%rbp) 2799 0x40056d <main(int, char**)+11>: mov %rsi,-0x10(%rbp) 2800 0x400571 <main(int, char**)+15>: mov 0x40061c,%esi 2801 0x400576 <main(int, char**)+20>: mov 0x2a,%edi 2802 0x40057b <main(int, char**)+25>: 2803 callq 0x400536 <Func1(int, char const*)> 2804 2805 * Fortran: Support structures with fields of dynamic types and 2806 arrays of dynamic types. 2807 2808 * The symbol dumping maintenance commands have new syntax. 2809 maint print symbols [-pc address] [--] [filename] 2810 maint print symbols [-objfile objfile] [-source source] [--] [filename] 2811 maint print psymbols [-objfile objfile] [-pc address] [--] [filename] 2812 maint print psymbols [-objfile objfile] [-source source] [--] [filename] 2813 maint print msymbols [-objfile objfile] [--] [filename] 2814 2815 * GDB now supports multibit bitfields and enums in target register 2816 descriptions. 2817 2818 * New Python-based convenience function _as_string(val), which returns 2819 the textual representation of a value. This function is especially 2820 useful to obtain the text label of an enum value. 2821 2822 * Intel MPX bound violation handling. 2823 2824 Segmentation faults caused by a Intel MPX boundary violation 2825 now display the kind of violation (upper or lower), the memory 2826 address accessed and the memory bounds, along with the usual 2827 signal received and code location. 2828 2829 For example: 2830 2831 Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault 2832 Upper bound violation while accessing address 0x7fffffffc3b3 2833 Bounds: [lower = 0x7fffffffc390, upper = 0x7fffffffc3a3] 2834 0x0000000000400d7c in upper () at i386-mpx-sigsegv.c:68 2835 2836 * Rust language support. 2837 GDB now supports debugging programs written in the Rust programming 2838 language. See https://www.rust-lang.org/ for more information about 2839 Rust. 2840 2841 * Support for running interpreters on specified input/output devices 2842 2843 GDB now supports a new mechanism that allows frontends to provide 2844 fully featured GDB console views, as a better alternative to 2845 building such views on top of the \\"-interpreter-exec console\\" 2846 command. See the new \\"new-ui\\" command below. With that command, 2847 frontends can now start GDB in the traditional command-line mode 2848 running in an embedded terminal emulator widget, and create a 2849 separate MI interpreter running on a specified i/o device. In this 2850 way, GDB handles line editing, history, tab completion, etc. in the 2851 console all by itself, and the GUI uses the separate MI interpreter 2852 for its own control and synchronization, invisible to the command 2853 line. 2854 2855 * The \\"catch syscall\\" command catches groups of related syscalls. 2856 2857 The \\"catch syscall\\" command now supports catching a group of related 2858 syscalls using the 'group:' or 'g:' prefix. 2859 2860 * New commands 2861 2862 skip -file file 2863 skip -gfile file-glob-pattern 2864 skip -function function 2865 skip -rfunction regular-expression 2866 A generalized form of the skip command, with new support for 2867 glob-style file names and regular expressions for function names. 2868 Additionally, a file spec and a function spec may now be combined. 2869 2870 maint info line-table REGEXP 2871 Display the contents of GDB's internal line table data structure. 2872 2873 maint selftest 2874 Run any GDB unit tests that were compiled in. 2875 2876 new-ui INTERP TTY 2877 Start a new user interface instance running INTERP as interpreter, 2878 using the TTY file for input/output. 2879 2880 * Python Scripting 2881 2882 ** gdb.Breakpoint objects have a new attribute \\"pending\\", which 2883 indicates whether the breakpoint is pending. 2884 ** Three new breakpoint-related events have been added: 2885 gdb.breakpoint_created, gdb.breakpoint_modified, and 2886 gdb.breakpoint_deleted. 2887 2888 signal-event EVENTID 2889 Signal (\\"set\\") the given MS-Windows event object. This is used in 2890 conjunction with the Windows JIT debugging (AeDebug) support, where 2891 the OS suspends a crashing process until a debugger can attach to 2892 it. Resuming the crashing process, in order to debug it, is done by 2893 signalling an event. 2894 2895 * Support for tracepoints and fast tracepoints on s390-linux and s390x-linux 2896 was added in GDBserver, including JIT compiling fast tracepoint's 2897 conditional expression bytecode into native code. 2898 2899 * Support for various remote target protocols and ROM monitors has 2900 been removed: 2901 2902 target m32rsdi Remote M32R debugging over SDI 2903 target mips MIPS remote debugging protocol 2904 target pmon PMON ROM monitor 2905 target ddb NEC's DDB variant of PMON for Vr4300 2906 target rockhopper NEC RockHopper variant of PMON 2907 target lsi LSI variant of PMO 2908 2909 * Support for tracepoints and fast tracepoints on powerpc-linux, 2910 powerpc64-linux, and powerpc64le-linux was added in GDBserver, 2911 including JIT compiling fast tracepoint's conditional expression 2912 bytecode into native code. 2913 2914 * MI async record =record-started now includes the method and format used for 2915 recording. For example: 2916 2917 =record-started,thread-group=\\"i1\\",method=\\"btrace\\",format=\\"bts\\" 2918 2919 * MI async record =thread-selected now includes the frame field. For example: 2920 2921 =thread-selected,id=\\"3\\",frame={level=\\"0\\",addr=\\"0x00000000004007c0\\"} 2922 2923 * New targets 2924 2925 Andes NDS32 nds32*-*-elf 2926 2927 *** Changes in GDB 7.11 2928 2929 * GDB now supports debugging kernel-based threads on FreeBSD. 2930 2931 * Per-inferior thread numbers 2932 2933 Thread numbers are now per inferior instead of global. If you're 2934 debugging multiple inferiors, GDB displays thread IDs using a 2935 qualified INF_NUM.THR_NUM form. For example: 2936 2937 (gdb) info threads 2938 Id Target Id Frame 2939 1.1 Thread 0x7ffff7fc2740 (LWP 8155) (running) 2940 1.2 Thread 0x7ffff7fc1700 (LWP 8168) (running) 2941 * 2.1 Thread 0x7ffff7fc2740 (LWP 8157) (running) 2942 2.2 Thread 0x7ffff7fc1700 (LWP 8190) (running) 2943 2944 As consequence, thread numbers as visible in the _thread 2945 convenience variable and in Python's InferiorThread.num attribute 2946 are no longer unique between inferiors. 2947 2948 GDB now maintains a second thread ID per thread, referred to as the 2949 global thread ID, which is the new equivalent of thread numbers in 2950 previous releases. See also _gthread below. 2951 2952 For backwards compatibility, MI's thread IDs always refer to global 2953 IDs. 2954 2955 * Commands that accept thread IDs now accept the qualified 2956 INF_NUM.THR_NUM form as well. For example: 2957 2958 (gdb) thread 2.1 2959 [Switching to thread 2.1 (Thread 0x7ffff7fc2740 (LWP 8157))] (running) 2960 (gdb) 2961 2962 * In commands that accept a list of thread IDs, you can now refer to 2963 all threads of an inferior using a star wildcard. GDB accepts 2964 \\"INF_NUM.*\\", to refer to all threads of inferior INF_NUM, and \\"*\\" to 2965 refer to all threads of the current inferior. For example, \\"info 2966 threads 2.*\\". 2967 2968 * You can use \\"info threads -gid\\" to display the global thread ID of 2969 all threads. 2970 2971 * The new convenience variable _gthread holds the global number of 2972 the current thread. 2973 2974 * The new convenience variable _inferior holds the number of the 2975 current inferior. 2976 2977 * GDB now displays the ID and name of the thread that hit a breakpoint 2978 or received a signal, if your program is multi-threaded. For 2979 example: 2980 2981 Thread 3 \\"bar\\" hit Breakpoint 1 at 0x40087a: file program.c, line 20. 2982 Thread 1 \\"main\\" received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. 2983 2984 * Record btrace now supports non-stop mode. 2985 2986 * Support for tracepoints on aarch64-linux was added in GDBserver. 2987 2988 * The 'record instruction-history' command now indicates speculative execution 2989 when using the Intel Processor Trace recording format. 2990 2991 * GDB now allows users to specify explicit locations, bypassing 2992 the linespec parser. This feature is also available to GDB/MI 2993 clients. 2994 2995 * Multi-architecture debugging is supported on AArch64 GNU/Linux. 2996 GDB now is able to debug both AArch64 applications and ARM applications 2997 at the same time. 2998 2999 * Support for fast tracepoints on aarch64-linux was added in GDBserver, 3000 including JIT compiling fast tracepoint's conditional expression bytecode 3001 into native code. 3002 3003 * GDB now supports displaced stepping on AArch64 GNU/Linux. 3004 3005 * \\"info threads\\", \\"info inferiors\\", \\"info display\\", \\"info checkpoints\\" 3006 and \\"maint info program-spaces\\" now list the corresponding items in 3007 ascending ID order, for consistency with all other \\"info\\" commands. 3008 3009 * In Ada, the overloads selection menu has been enhanced to display the 3010 parameter types and the return types for the matching overloaded subprograms. 3011 3012 * New commands 3013 3014 maint set target-non-stop (on|off|auto) 3015 maint show target-non-stop 3016 Control whether GDB targets always operate in non-stop mode even if 3017 \\"set non-stop\\" is \\"off\\". The default is \\"auto\\", meaning non-stop 3018 mode is enabled if supported by the target. 3019 3020 maint set bfd-sharing 3021 maint show bfd-sharing 3022 Control the reuse of bfd objects. 3023 3024 set debug bfd-cache 3025 show debug bfd-cache 3026 Control display of debugging info regarding bfd caching. 3027 3028 set debug fbsd-lwp 3029 show debug fbsd-lwp 3030 Control display of debugging info regarding FreeBSD threads. 3031 3032 set remote multiprocess-extensions-packet 3033 show remote multiprocess-extensions-packet 3034 Set/show the use of the remote protocol multiprocess extensions. 3035 3036 set remote thread-events 3037 show remote thread-events 3038 Set/show the use of thread create/exit events. 3039 3040 set ada print-signatures on|off 3041 show ada print-signatures\\" 3042 Control whether parameter types and return types are displayed in overloads 3043 selection menus. It is activated (@code{on}) by default. 3044 3045 set max-value-size 3046 show max-value-size 3047 Controls the maximum size of memory, in bytes, that GDB will 3048 allocate for value contents. Prevents incorrect programs from 3049 causing GDB to allocate overly large buffers. Default is 64k. 3050 3051 * The \\"disassemble\\" command accepts a new modifier: /s. 3052 It prints mixed source+disassembly like /m with two differences: 3053 - disassembled instructions are now printed in program order, and 3054 - and source for all relevant files is now printed. 3055 The \\"/m\\" option is now considered deprecated: its \\"source-centric\\" 3056 output hasn't proved useful in practice. 3057 3058 * The \\"record instruction-history\\" command accepts a new modifier: /s. 3059 It behaves exactly like /m and prints mixed source+disassembly. 3060 3061 * The \\"set scheduler-locking\\" command supports a new mode \\"replay\\". 3062 It behaves like \\"off\\" in record mode and like \\"on\\" in replay mode. 3063 3064 * Support for various ROM monitors has been removed: 3065 3066 target dbug dBUG ROM monitor for Motorola ColdFire 3067 target picobug Motorola picobug monitor 3068 target dink32 DINK32 ROM monitor for PowerPC 3069 target m32r Renesas M32R/D ROM monitor 3070 target mon2000 mon2000 ROM monitor 3071 target ppcbug PPCBUG ROM monitor for PowerPC 3072 3073 * Support for reading/writing memory and extracting values on architectures 3074 whose memory is addressable in units of any integral multiple of 8 bits. 3075 3076 catch handlers 3077 Allows to break when an Ada exception is handled. 3078 3079 * New remote packets 3080 3081 exec stop reason 3082 Indicates that an exec system call was executed. 3083 3084 exec-events feature in qSupported 3085 The qSupported packet allows GDB to request support for exec 3086 events using the new 'gdbfeature' exec-event, and the qSupported 3087 response can contain the corresponding 'stubfeature'. Set and 3088 show commands can be used to display whether these features are enabled. 3089 3090 vCtrlC 3091 Equivalent to interrupting with the ^C character, but works in 3092 non-stop mode. 3093 3094 thread created stop reason (T05 create:...) 3095 Indicates that the thread was just created and is stopped at entry. 3096 3097 thread exit stop reply (w exitcode;tid) 3098 Indicates that the thread has terminated. 3099 3100 QThreadEvents 3101 Enables/disables thread create and exit event reporting. For 3102 example, this is used in non-stop mode when GDB stops a set of 3103 threads and synchronously waits for the their corresponding stop 3104 replies. Without exit events, if one of the threads exits, GDB 3105 would hang forever not knowing that it should no longer expect a 3106 stop for that same thread. 3107 3108 N stop reply 3109 Indicates that there are no resumed threads left in the target (all 3110 threads are stopped). The remote stub reports support for this stop 3111 reply to GDB's qSupported query. 3112 3113 QCatchSyscalls 3114 Enables/disables catching syscalls from the inferior process. 3115 The remote stub reports support for this packet to GDB's qSupported query. 3116 3117 syscall_entry stop reason 3118 Indicates that a syscall was just called. 3119 3120 syscall_return stop reason 3121 Indicates that a syscall just returned. 3122 3123 * Extended-remote exec events 3124 3125 ** GDB now has support for exec events on extended-remote Linux targets. 3126 For such targets with Linux kernels 2.5.46 and later, this enables 3127 follow-exec-mode and exec catchpoints. 3128 3129 set remote exec-event-feature-packet 3130 show remote exec-event-feature-packet 3131 Set/show the use of the remote exec event feature. 3132 3133 * Thread names in remote protocol 3134 3135 The reply to qXfer:threads:read may now include a name attribute for each 3136 thread. 3137 3138 * Target remote mode fork and exec events 3139 3140 ** GDB now has support for fork and exec events on target remote mode 3141 Linux targets. For such targets with Linux kernels 2.5.46 and later, 3142 this enables follow-fork-mode, detach-on-fork, follow-exec-mode, and 3143 fork and exec catchpoints. 3144 3145 * Remote syscall events 3146 3147 ** GDB now has support for catch syscall on remote Linux targets, 3148 currently enabled on x86/x86_64 architectures. 3149 3150 set remote catch-syscall-packet 3151 show remote catch-syscall-packet 3152 Set/show the use of the remote catch syscall feature. 3153 3154 * MI changes 3155 3156 ** The -var-set-format command now accepts the zero-hexadecimal 3157 format. It outputs data in hexadecimal format with zero-padding on the 3158 left. 3159 3160 * Python Scripting 3161 3162 ** gdb.InferiorThread objects have a new attribute \\"global_num\\", 3163 which refers to the thread's global thread ID. The existing 3164 \\"num\\" attribute now refers to the thread's per-inferior number. 3165 See \\"Per-inferior thread numbers\\" above. 3166 ** gdb.InferiorThread objects have a new attribute \\"inferior\\", which 3167 is the Inferior object the thread belongs to. 3168 3169 *** Changes in GDB 7.10 3170 3171 * Support for process record-replay and reverse debugging on aarch64*-linux* 3172 targets has been added. GDB now supports recording of A64 instruction set 3173 including advance SIMD instructions. 3174 3175 * Support for Sun's version of the \\"stabs\\" debug file format has been removed. 3176 3177 * GDB now honors the content of the file /proc/PID/coredump_filter 3178 (PID is the process ID) on GNU/Linux systems. This file can be used 3179 to specify the types of memory mappings that will be included in a 3180 corefile. For more information, please refer to the manual page of 3181 \\"core(5)\\". GDB also has a new command: \\"set use-coredump-filter 3182 on|off\\". It allows to set whether GDB will read the content of the 3183 /proc/PID/coredump_filter file when generating a corefile. 3184 3185 * The \\"info os\\" command on GNU/Linux can now display information on 3186 cpu information : 3187 \\"info os cpus\\" Listing of all cpus/cores on the system 3188 3189 * GDB has two new commands: \\"set serial parity odd|even|none\\" and 3190 \\"show serial parity\\". These allows to set or show parity for the 3191 remote serial I/O. 3192 3193 * The \\"info source\\" command now displays the producer string if it was 3194 present in the debug info. This typically includes the compiler version 3195 and may include things like its command line arguments. 3196 3197 * The \\"info dll\\", an alias of the \\"info sharedlibrary\\" command, 3198 is now available on all platforms. 3199 3200 * Directory names supplied to the \\"set sysroot\\" commands may be 3201 prefixed with \\"target:\\" to tell GDB to access shared libraries from 3202 the target system, be it local or remote. This replaces the prefix 3203 \\"remote:\\". The default sysroot has been changed from \\"\\" to 3204 \\"target:\\". \\"remote:\\" is automatically converted to \\"target:\\" for 3205 backward compatibility. 3206 3207 * The system root specified by \\"set sysroot\\" will be prepended to the 3208 filename of the main executable (if reported to GDB as absolute by 3209 the operating system) when starting processes remotely, and when 3210 attaching to already-running local or remote processes. 3211 3212 * GDB now supports automatic location and retrieval of executable 3213 files from remote targets. Remote debugging can now be initiated 3214 using only a \\"target remote\\" or \\"target extended-remote\\" command 3215 (no \\"set sysroot\\" or \\"file\\" commands are required). See \\"New remote 3216 packets\\" below. 3217 3218 * The \\"dump\\" command now supports verilog hex format. 3219 3220 * GDB now supports the vector ABI on S/390 GNU/Linux targets. 3221 3222 * On GNU/Linux, GDB and gdbserver are now able to access executable 3223 and shared library files without a \\"set sysroot\\" command when 3224 attaching to processes running in different mount namespaces from 3225 the debugger. This makes it possible to attach to processes in 3226 containers as simply as \\"gdb -p PID\\" or \\"gdbserver --attach PID\\". 3227 See \\"New remote packets\\" below. 3228 3229 * The \\"tui reg\\" command now provides completion for all of the 3230 available register groups, including target specific groups. 3231 3232 * The HISTSIZE environment variable is no longer read when determining 3233 the size of GDB's command history. GDB now instead reads the dedicated 3234 GDBHISTSIZE environment variable. Setting GDBHISTSIZE to \\"-1\\" or to \\"\\" now 3235 disables truncation of command history. Non-numeric values of GDBHISTSIZE 3236 are ignored. 3237 3238 * Guile Scripting 3239 3240 ** Memory ports can now be unbuffered. 3241 3242 * Python Scripting 3243 3244 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new attribute \\"username\\", 3245 which is the name of the objfile as specified by the user, 3246 without, for example, resolving symlinks. 3247 ** You can now write frame unwinders in Python. 3248 ** gdb.Type objects have a new method \\"optimized_out\\", 3249 returning optimized out gdb.Value instance of this type. 3250 ** gdb.Value objects have new methods \\"reference_value\\" and 3251 \\"const_value\\" which return a reference to the value and a 3252 \\"const\\" version of the value respectively. 3253 3254 * New commands 3255 3256 maint print symbol-cache 3257 Print the contents of the symbol cache. 3258 3259 maint print symbol-cache-statistics 3260 Print statistics of symbol cache usage. 3261 3262 maint flush-symbol-cache 3263 Flush the contents of the symbol cache. 3264 3265 record btrace bts 3266 record bts 3267 Start branch trace recording using Branch Trace Store (BTS) format. 3268 3269 compile print 3270 Evaluate expression by using the compiler and print result. 3271 3272 tui enable 3273 tui disable 3274 Explicit commands for enabling and disabling tui mode. 3275 3276 show mpx bound 3277 set mpx bound on i386 and amd64 3278 Support for bound table investigation on Intel MPX enabled applications. 3279 3280 record btrace pt 3281 record pt 3282 Start branch trace recording using Intel Processor Trace format. 3283 3284 maint info btrace 3285 Print information about branch tracing internals. 3286 3287 maint btrace packet-history 3288 Print the raw branch tracing data. 3289 3290 maint btrace clear-packet-history 3291 Discard the stored raw branch tracing data. 3292 3293 maint btrace clear 3294 Discard all branch tracing data. It will be fetched and processed 3295 anew by the next \\"record\\" command. 3296 3297 * New options 3298 3299 set debug dwarf-die 3300 Renamed from \\"set debug dwarf2-die\\". 3301 show debug dwarf-die 3302 Renamed from \\"show debug dwarf2-die\\". 3303 3304 set debug dwarf-read 3305 Renamed from \\"set debug dwarf2-read\\". 3306 show debug dwarf-read 3307 Renamed from \\"show debug dwarf2-read\\". 3308 3309 maint set dwarf always-disassemble 3310 Renamed from \\"maint set dwarf2 always-disassemble\\". 3311 maint show dwarf always-disassemble 3312 Renamed from \\"maint show dwarf2 always-disassemble\\". 3313 3314 maint set dwarf max-cache-age 3315 Renamed from \\"maint set dwarf2 max-cache-age\\". 3316 maint show dwarf max-cache-age 3317 Renamed from \\"maint show dwarf2 max-cache-age\\". 3318 3319 set debug dwarf-line 3320 show debug dwarf-line 3321 Control display of debugging info regarding DWARF line processing. 3322 3323 set max-completions 3324 show max-completions 3325 Set the maximum number of candidates to be considered during 3326 completion. The default value is 200. This limit allows GDB 3327 to avoid generating large completion lists, the computation of 3328 which can cause the debugger to become temporarily unresponsive. 3329 3330 set history remove-duplicates 3331 show history remove-duplicates 3332 Control the removal of duplicate history entries. 3333 3334 maint set symbol-cache-size 3335 maint show symbol-cache-size 3336 Control the size of the symbol cache. 3337 3338 set|show record btrace bts buffer-size 3339 Set and show the size of the ring buffer used for branch tracing in 3340 BTS format. 3341 The obtained size may differ from the requested size. Use \\"info 3342 record\\" to see the obtained buffer size. 3343 3344 set debug linux-namespaces 3345 show debug linux-namespaces 3346 Control display of debugging info regarding Linux namespaces. 3347 3348 set|show record btrace pt buffer-size 3349 Set and show the size of the ring buffer used for branch tracing in 3350 Intel Processor Trace format. 3351 The obtained size may differ from the requested size. Use \\"info 3352 record\\" to see the obtained buffer size. 3353 3354 maint set|show btrace pt skip-pad 3355 Set and show whether PAD packets are skipped when computing the 3356 packet history. 3357 3358 * The command 'thread apply all' can now support new option '-ascending' 3359 to call its specified command for all threads in ascending order. 3360 3361 * Python/Guile scripting 3362 3363 ** GDB now supports auto-loading of Python/Guile scripts contained in the 3364 special section named \`.debug_gdb_scripts'. 3365 3366 * New remote packets 3367 3368 qXfer:btrace-conf:read 3369 Return the branch trace configuration for the current thread. 3370 3371 Qbtrace-conf:bts:size 3372 Set the requested ring buffer size for branch tracing in BTS format. 3373 3374 Qbtrace:pt 3375 Enable Intel Processor Trace-based branch tracing for the current 3376 process. The remote stub reports support for this packet to GDB's 3377 qSupported query. 3378 3379 Qbtrace-conf:pt:size 3380 Set the requested ring buffer size for branch tracing in Intel Processor 3381 Trace format. 3382 3383 swbreak stop reason 3384 Indicates a memory breakpoint instruction was executed, irrespective 3385 of whether it was GDB that planted the breakpoint or the breakpoint 3386 is hardcoded in the program. This is required for correct non-stop 3387 mode operation. 3388 3389 hwbreak stop reason 3390 Indicates the target stopped for a hardware breakpoint. This is 3391 required for correct non-stop mode operation. 3392 3393 vFile:fstat: 3394 Return information about files on the remote system. 3395 3396 qXfer:exec-file:read 3397 Return the full absolute name of the file that was executed to 3398 create a process running on the remote system. 3399 3400 vFile:setfs: 3401 Select the filesystem on which vFile: operations with filename 3402 arguments will operate. This is required for GDB to be able to 3403 access files on remote targets where the remote stub does not 3404 share a common filesystem with the inferior(s). 3405 3406 fork stop reason 3407 Indicates that a fork system call was executed. 3408 3409 vfork stop reason 3410 Indicates that a vfork system call was executed. 3411 3412 vforkdone stop reason 3413 Indicates that a vfork child of the specified process has executed 3414 an exec or exit, allowing the vfork parent to resume execution. 3415 3416 fork-events and vfork-events features in qSupported 3417 The qSupported packet allows GDB to request support for fork and 3418 vfork events using new 'gdbfeatures' fork-events and vfork-events, 3419 and the qSupported response can contain the corresponding 3420 'stubfeatures'. Set and show commands can be used to display 3421 whether these features are enabled. 3422 3423 * Extended-remote fork events 3424 3425 ** GDB now has support for fork events on extended-remote Linux 3426 targets. For targets with Linux kernels 2.5.60 and later, this 3427 enables follow-fork-mode and detach-on-fork for both fork and 3428 vfork, as well as fork and vfork catchpoints. 3429 3430 * The info record command now shows the recording format and the 3431 branch tracing configuration for the current thread when using 3432 the btrace record target. 3433 For the BTS format, it shows the ring buffer size. 3434 3435 * GDB now has support for DTrace USDT (Userland Static Defined 3436 Tracing) probes. The supported targets are x86_64-*-linux-gnu. 3437 3438 * GDB now supports access to vector registers on S/390 GNU/Linux 3439 targets. 3440 3441 * Removed command line options 3442 3443 -xdb HP-UX XDB compatibility mode. 3444 3445 * Removed targets and native configurations 3446 3447 HP/PA running HP-UX hppa*-*-hpux* 3448 Itanium running HP-UX ia64-*-hpux* 3449 3450 * New configure options 3451 3452 --with-intel-pt 3453 This configure option allows the user to build GDB with support for 3454 Intel Processor Trace (default: auto). This requires libipt. 3455 3456 --with-libipt-prefix=PATH 3457 Specify the path to the version of libipt that GDB should use. 3458 PATH/include should contain the intel-pt.h header and 3459 PATH/lib should contain the libipt.so library. 3460 3461 *** Changes in GDB 7.9.1 3462 3463 * Python Scripting 3464 3465 ** Xmethods can now specify a result type. 3466 3467 *** Changes in GDB 7.9 3468 3469 * GDB now supports hardware watchpoints on x86 GNU Hurd. 3470 3471 * Python Scripting 3472 3473 ** You can now access frame registers from Python scripts. 3474 ** New attribute 'producer' for gdb.Symtab objects. 3475 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new attribute \\"progspace\\", 3476 which is the gdb.Progspace object of the containing program space. 3477 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new attribute \\"owner\\". 3478 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new attribute \\"build_id\\", 3479 which is the build ID generated when the file was built. 3480 ** gdb.Objfile objects have a new method \\"add_separate_debug_file\\". 3481 ** A new event \\"gdb.clear_objfiles\\" has been added, triggered when 3482 selecting a new file to debug. 3483 ** You can now add attributes to gdb.Objfile and gdb.Progspace objects. 3484 ** New function gdb.lookup_objfile. 3485 3486 New events which are triggered when GDB modifies the state of the 3487 inferior. 3488 3489 ** gdb.events.inferior_call_pre: Function call is about to be made. 3490 ** gdb.events.inferior_call_post: Function call has just been made. 3491 ** gdb.events.memory_changed: A memory location has been altered. 3492 ** gdb.events.register_changed: A register has been altered. 3493 3494 * New Python-based convenience functions: 3495 3496 ** _caller_is(name [, number_of_frames]) 3497 ** _caller_matches(regexp [, number_of_frames]) 3498 ** _any_caller_is(name [, number_of_frames]) 3499 ** _any_caller_matches(regexp [, number_of_frames]) 3500 3501 * GDB now supports the compilation and injection of source code into 3502 the inferior. GDB will use GCC 5.0 or higher built with libcc1.so 3503 to compile the source code to object code, and if successful, inject 3504 and execute that code within the current context of the inferior. 3505 Currently the C language is supported. The commands used to 3506 interface with this new feature are: 3507 3508 compile code [-raw|-r] [--] [source code] 3509 compile file [-raw|-r] filename 3510 3511 * New commands 3512 3513 demangle [-l language] [--] name 3514 Demangle \\"name\\" in the specified language, or the current language 3515 if elided. This command is renamed from the \\"maint demangle\\" command. 3516 The latter is kept as a no-op to avoid \\"maint demangle\\" being interpreted 3517 as \\"maint demangler-warning\\". 3518 3519 queue-signal signal-name-or-number 3520 Queue a signal to be delivered to the thread when it is resumed. 3521 3522 add-auto-load-scripts-directory directory 3523 Add entries to the list of directories from which to load auto-loaded 3524 scripts. 3525 3526 maint print user-registers 3527 List all currently available \\"user\\" registers. 3528 3529 compile code [-r|-raw] [--] [source code] 3530 Compile, inject, and execute in the inferior the executable object 3531 code produced by compiling the provided source code. 3532 3533 compile file [-r|-raw] filename 3534 Compile and inject into the inferior the executable object code 3535 produced by compiling the source code stored in the filename 3536 provided. 3537 3538 * On resume, GDB now always passes the signal the program had stopped 3539 for to the thread the signal was sent to, even if the user changed 3540 threads before resuming. Previously GDB would often (but not 3541 always) deliver the signal to the thread that happens to be current 3542 at resume time. 3543 3544 * Conversely, the \\"signal\\" command now consistently delivers the 3545 requested signal to the current thread. GDB now asks for 3546 confirmation if the program had stopped for a signal and the user 3547 switched threads meanwhile. 3548 3549 * \\"breakpoint always-inserted\\" modes \\"off\\" and \\"auto\\" merged. 3550 3551 Now, when 'breakpoint always-inserted mode' is set to \\"off\\", GDB 3552 won't remove breakpoints from the target until all threads stop, 3553 even in non-stop mode. The \\"auto\\" mode has been removed, and \\"off\\" 3554 is now the default mode. 3555 3556 * New options 3557 3558 set debug symbol-lookup 3559 show debug symbol-lookup 3560 Control display of debugging info regarding symbol lookup. 3561 3562 * MI changes 3563 3564 ** The -list-thread-groups command outputs an exit-code field for 3565 inferiors that have exited. 3566 3567 * New targets 3568 3569 MIPS SDE mips*-sde*-elf* 3570 3571 * Removed targets 3572 3573 Support for these obsolete configurations has been removed. 3574 3575 Alpha running OSF/1 (or Tru64) alpha*-*-osf* 3576 SGI Irix-5.x mips-*-irix5* 3577 SGI Irix-6.x mips-*-irix6* 3578 VAX running (4.2 - 4.3 Reno) BSD vax-*-bsd* 3579 VAX running Ultrix vax-*-ultrix* 3580 3581 * The \\"dll-symbols\\" command, and its two aliases (\\"add-shared-symbol-files\\" 3582 and \\"assf\\"), have been removed. Use the \\"sharedlibrary\\" command, or 3583 its alias \\"share\\", instead. 3584 3585 *** Changes in GDB 7.8 3586 3587 * New command line options 3588 3589 -D data-directory 3590 This is an alias for the --data-directory option. 3591 3592 * GDB supports printing and modifying of variable length automatic arrays 3593 as specified in ISO C99. 3594 3595 * The ARM simulator now supports instruction level tracing 3596 with or without disassembly. 3597 3598 * Guile scripting 3599 3600 GDB now has support for scripting using Guile. Whether this is 3601 available is determined at configure time. 3602 Guile version 2.0 or greater is required. 3603 Guile version 2.0.9 is well tested, earlier 2.0 versions are not. 3604 3605 * New commands (for set/show, see \\"New options\\" below) 3606 3607 guile [code] 3608 gu [code] 3609 Invoke CODE by passing it to the Guile interpreter. 3610 3611 guile-repl 3612 gr 3613 Start a Guile interactive prompt (or \\"repl\\" for \\"read-eval-print loop\\"). 3614 3615 info auto-load guile-scripts [regexp] 3616 Print the list of automatically loaded Guile scripts. 3617 3618 * The source command is now capable of sourcing Guile scripts. 3619 This feature is dependent on the debugger being built with Guile support. 3620 3621 * New options 3622 3623 set print symbol-loading (off|brief|full) 3624 show print symbol-loading 3625 Control whether to print informational messages when loading symbol 3626 information for a file. The default is \\"full\\", but when debugging 3627 programs with large numbers of shared libraries the amount of output 3628 becomes less useful. 3629 3630 set guile print-stack (none|message|full) 3631 show guile print-stack 3632 Show a stack trace when an error is encountered in a Guile script. 3633 3634 set auto-load guile-scripts (on|off) 3635 show auto-load guile-scripts 3636 Control auto-loading of Guile script files. 3637 3638 maint ada set ignore-descriptive-types (on|off) 3639 maint ada show ignore-descriptive-types 3640 Control whether the debugger should ignore descriptive types in Ada 3641 programs. The default is not to ignore the descriptive types. See 3642 the user manual for more details on descriptive types and the intended 3643 usage of this option. 3644 3645 set auto-connect-native-target 3646 3647 Control whether GDB is allowed to automatically connect to the 3648 native target for the run, attach, etc. commands when not connected 3649 to any target yet. See also \\"target native\\" below. 3650 3651 set record btrace replay-memory-access (read-only|read-write) 3652 show record btrace replay-memory-access 3653 Control what memory accesses are allowed during replay. 3654 3655 maint set target-async (on|off) 3656 maint show target-async 3657 This controls whether GDB targets operate in synchronous or 3658 asynchronous mode. Normally the default is asynchronous, if it is 3659 available; but this can be changed to more easily debug problems 3660 occurring only in synchronous mode. 3661 3662 set mi-async (on|off) 3663 show mi-async 3664 Control whether MI asynchronous mode is preferred. This supersedes 3665 \\"set target-async\\" of previous GDB versions. 3666 3667 * \\"set target-async\\" is deprecated as a CLI option and is now an alias 3668 for \\"set mi-async\\" (only puts MI into async mode). 3669 3670 * Background execution commands (e.g., \\"c&\\", \\"s&\\", etc.) are now 3671 possible \`\`out of the box'' if the target supports them. Previously 3672 the user would need to explicitly enable the possibility with the 3673 \\"set target-async on\\" command. 3674 3675 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 3676 3677 ** New option --debug-format=option1[,option2,...] allows one to add 3678 additional text to each output. At present only timestamps 3679 are supported: --debug-format=timestamps. 3680 Timestamps can also be turned on with the 3681 \\"monitor set debug-format timestamps\\" command from GDB. 3682 3683 * The 'record instruction-history' command now starts counting instructions 3684 at one. This also affects the instruction ranges reported by the 3685 'record function-call-history' command when given the /i modifier. 3686 3687 * The command 'record function-call-history' supports a new modifier '/c' to 3688 indent the function names based on their call stack depth. 3689 The fields for the '/i' and '/l' modifier have been reordered. 3690 The source line range is now prefixed with 'at'. 3691 The instruction range is now prefixed with 'inst'. 3692 Both ranges are now printed as '<from>, <to>' to allow copy&paste to the 3693 \\"record instruction-history\\" and \\"list\\" commands. 3694 3695 * The ranges given as arguments to the 'record function-call-history' and 3696 'record instruction-history' commands are now inclusive. 3697 3698 * The btrace record target now supports the 'record goto' command. 3699 For locations inside the execution trace, the back trace is computed 3700 based on the information stored in the execution trace. 3701 3702 * The btrace record target supports limited reverse execution and replay. 3703 The target does not record data and therefore does not allow reading 3704 memory or registers. 3705 3706 * The \\"catch syscall\\" command now works on s390*-linux* targets. 3707 3708 * The \\"compare-sections\\" command is no longer specific to target 3709 remote. It now works with all targets. 3710 3711 * All native targets are now consistently called \\"native\\". 3712 Consequently, the \\"target child\\", \\"target GNU\\", \\"target djgpp\\", 3713 \\"target procfs\\" (Solaris/Irix/OSF/AIX) and \\"target darwin-child\\" 3714 commands have been replaced with \\"target native\\". The QNX/NTO port 3715 leaves the \\"procfs\\" target in place and adds a \\"native\\" target for 3716 consistency with other ports. The impact on users should be minimal 3717 as these commands previously either throwed an error, or were 3718 no-ops. The target's name is visible in the output of the following 3719 commands: \\"help target\\", \\"info target\\", \\"info files\\", \\"maint print 3720 target-stack\\". 3721 3722 * The \\"target native\\" command now connects to the native target. This 3723 can be used to launch native programs even when \\"set 3724 auto-connect-native-target\\" is set to off. 3725 3726 * GDB now supports access to Intel MPX registers on GNU/Linux. 3727 3728 * Support for Intel AVX-512 registers on GNU/Linux. 3729 Support displaying and modifying Intel AVX-512 registers 3730 zmm0 - zmm31 and k0 - k7 on GNU/Linux. 3731 3732 * New remote packets 3733 3734 qXfer:btrace:read's annex 3735 The qXfer:btrace:read packet supports a new annex 'delta' to read 3736 branch trace incrementally. 3737 3738 * Python Scripting 3739 3740 ** Valid Python operations on gdb.Value objects representing 3741 structs/classes invoke the corresponding overloaded operators if 3742 available. 3743 ** New \`Xmethods' feature in the Python API. Xmethods are 3744 additional methods or replacements for existing methods of a C++ 3745 class. This feature is useful for those cases where a method 3746 defined in C++ source code could be inlined or optimized out by 3747 the compiler, making it unavailable to GDB. 3748 3749 * New targets 3750 PowerPC64 GNU/Linux little-endian powerpc64le-*-linux* 3751 3752 * The \\"dll-symbols\\" command, and its two aliases (\\"add-shared-symbol-files\\" 3753 and \\"assf\\"), have been deprecated. Use the \\"sharedlibrary\\" command, or 3754 its alias \\"share\\", instead. 3755 3756 * The commands \\"set remotebaud\\" and \\"show remotebaud\\" are no longer 3757 supported. Use \\"set serial baud\\" and \\"show serial baud\\" (respectively) 3758 instead. 3759 3760 * MI changes 3761 3762 ** A new option \\"-gdb-set mi-async\\" replaces \\"-gdb-set 3763 target-async\\". The latter is left as a deprecated alias of the 3764 former for backward compatibility. If the target supports it, 3765 CLI background execution commands are now always possible by 3766 default, independently of whether the frontend stated a 3767 preference for asynchronous execution with \\"-gdb-set mi-async\\". 3768 Previously \\"-gdb-set target-async off\\" affected both MI execution 3769 commands and CLI execution commands. 3770 3771 *** Changes in GDB 7.7 3772 3773 * Improved support for process record-replay and reverse debugging on 3774 arm*-linux* targets. Support for thumb32 and syscall instruction 3775 recording has been added. 3776 3777 * GDB now supports SystemTap SDT probes on AArch64 GNU/Linux. 3778 3779 * GDB now supports Fission DWP file format version 2. 3780 http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission 3781 3782 * New convenience function \\"_isvoid\\", to check whether an expression 3783 is void. A void expression is an expression where the type of the 3784 result is \\"void\\". For example, some convenience variables may be 3785 \\"void\\" when evaluated (e.g., \\"_exitcode\\" before the execution of 3786 the program being debugged; or an undefined convenience variable). 3787 Another example, when calling a function whose return type is 3788 \\"void\\". 3789 3790 * The \\"maintenance print objfiles\\" command now takes an optional regexp. 3791 3792 * The \\"catch syscall\\" command now works on arm*-linux* targets. 3793 3794 * GDB now consistently shows \\"<not saved>\\" when printing values of 3795 registers the debug info indicates have not been saved in the frame 3796 and there's nowhere to retrieve them from 3797 (callee-saved/call-clobbered registers): 3798 3799 (gdb) p rax 3800 1 = <not saved> 3801 3802 (gdb) info registers rax 3803 rax <not saved> 3804 3805 Before, the former would print \\"<optimized out>\\", and the latter 3806 \\"*value not available*\\". 3807 3808 * New script contrib/gdb-add-index.sh for adding .gdb_index sections 3809 to binaries. 3810 3811 * Python scripting 3812 3813 ** Frame filters and frame decorators have been added. 3814 ** Temporary breakpoints are now supported. 3815 ** Line tables representation has been added. 3816 ** New attribute 'parent_type' for gdb.Field objects. 3817 ** gdb.Field objects can be used as subscripts on gdb.Value objects. 3818 ** New attribute 'name' for gdb.Type objects. 3819 3820 * New targets 3821 3822 Nios II ELF nios2*-*-elf 3823 Nios II GNU/Linux nios2*-*-linux 3824 Texas Instruments MSP430 msp430*-*-elf 3825 3826 * Removed native configurations 3827 3828 Support for these a.out NetBSD and OpenBSD obsolete configurations has 3829 been removed. ELF variants of these configurations are kept supported. 3830 3831 arm*-*-netbsd* but arm*-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3832 i[34567]86-*-netbsd* but i[34567]86-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3833 i[34567]86-*-openbsd[0-2].* but i[34567]86-*-openbsd* is kept supported. 3834 i[34567]86-*-openbsd3.[0-3] 3835 m68*-*-netbsd* but m68*-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3836 sparc-*-netbsd* but sparc-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3837 vax-*-netbsd* but vax-*-netbsdelf* is kept supported. 3838 3839 * New commands: 3840 catch rethrow 3841 Like \\"catch throw\\", but catches a re-thrown exception. 3842 maint check-psymtabs 3843 Renamed from old \\"maint check-symtabs\\". 3844 maint check-symtabs 3845 Perform consistency checks on symtabs. 3846 maint expand-symtabs 3847 Expand symtabs matching an optional regexp. 3848 3849 show configuration 3850 Display the details of GDB configure-time options. 3851 3852 maint set|show per-command 3853 maint set|show per-command space 3854 maint set|show per-command time 3855 maint set|show per-command symtab 3856 Enable display of per-command gdb resource usage. 3857 3858 remove-symbol-file FILENAME 3859 remove-symbol-file -a ADDRESS 3860 Remove a symbol file added via add-symbol-file. The file to remove 3861 can be identified by its filename or by an address that lies within 3862 the boundaries of this symbol file in memory. 3863 3864 info exceptions 3865 info exceptions REGEXP 3866 Display the list of Ada exceptions defined in the program being 3867 debugged. If provided, only the exceptions whose names match REGEXP 3868 are listed. 3869 3870 * New options 3871 3872 set debug symfile off|on 3873 show debug symfile 3874 Control display of debugging info regarding reading symbol files and 3875 symbol tables within those files 3876 3877 set print raw frame-arguments 3878 show print raw frame-arguments 3879 Set/show whether to print frame arguments in raw mode, 3880 disregarding any defined pretty-printers. 3881 3882 set remote trace-status-packet 3883 show remote trace-status-packet 3884 Set/show the use of remote protocol qTStatus packet. 3885 3886 set debug nios2 3887 show debug nios2 3888 Control display of debugging messages related to Nios II targets. 3889 3890 set range-stepping 3891 show range-stepping 3892 Control whether target-assisted range stepping is enabled. 3893 3894 set startup-with-shell 3895 show startup-with-shell 3896 Specifies whether Unix child processes are started via a shell or 3897 directly. 3898 3899 set code-cache 3900 show code-cache 3901 Use the target memory cache for accesses to the code segment. This 3902 improves performance of remote debugging (particularly disassembly). 3903 3904 * You can now use a literal value 'unlimited' for options that 3905 interpret 0 or -1 as meaning \\"unlimited\\". E.g., \\"set 3906 trace-buffer-size unlimited\\" is now an alias for \\"set 3907 trace-buffer-size -1\\" and \\"set height unlimited\\" is now an alias for 3908 \\"set height 0\\". 3909 3910 * The \\"set debug symtab-create\\" debugging option of GDB has been changed to 3911 accept a verbosity level. 0 means \\"off\\", 1 provides basic debugging 3912 output, and values of 2 or greater provides more verbose output. 3913 3914 * New command-line options 3915 --configuration 3916 Display the details of GDB configure-time options. 3917 3918 * The command 'tsave' can now support new option '-ctf' to save trace 3919 buffer in Common Trace Format. 3920 3921 * Newly installed prefix/bin/gcore acts as a shell interface for the 3922 GDB command gcore. 3923 3924 * GDB now implements the C++ 'typeid' operator. 3925 3926 * The new convenience variable _exception holds the exception being 3927 thrown or caught at an exception-related catchpoint. 3928 3929 * The exception-related catchpoints, like \\"catch throw\\", now accept a 3930 regular expression which can be used to filter exceptions by type. 3931 3932 * The new convenience variable _exitsignal is automatically set to 3933 the terminating signal number when the program being debugged dies 3934 due to an uncaught signal. 3935 3936 * MI changes 3937 3938 ** All MI commands now accept an optional \\"--language\\" option. 3939 Support for this feature can be verified by using the \\"-list-features\\" 3940 command, which should contain \\"language-option\\". 3941 3942 ** The new command -info-gdb-mi-command allows the user to determine 3943 whether a GDB/MI command is supported or not. 3944 3945 ** The \\"^error\\" result record returned when trying to execute an undefined 3946 GDB/MI command now provides a variable named \\"code\\" whose content is the 3947 \\"undefined-command\\" error code. Support for this feature can be verified 3948 by using the \\"-list-features\\" command, which should contain 3949 \\"undefined-command-error-code\\". 3950 3951 ** The -trace-save MI command can optionally save trace buffer in Common 3952 Trace Format now. 3953 3954 ** The new command -dprintf-insert sets a dynamic printf breakpoint. 3955 3956 ** The command -data-list-register-values now accepts an optional 3957 \\"--skip-unavailable\\" option. When used, only the available registers 3958 are displayed. 3959 3960 ** The new command -trace-frame-collected dumps collected variables, 3961 computed expressions, tvars, memory and registers in a traceframe. 3962 3963 ** The commands -stack-list-locals, -stack-list-arguments and 3964 -stack-list-variables now accept an option \\"--skip-unavailable\\". 3965 When used, only the available locals or arguments are displayed. 3966 3967 ** The -exec-run command now accepts an optional \\"--start\\" option. 3968 When used, the command follows the same semantics as the \\"start\\" 3969 command, stopping the program's execution at the start of its 3970 main subprogram. Support for this feature can be verified using 3971 the \\"-list-features\\" command, which should contain 3972 \\"exec-run-start-option\\". 3973 3974 ** The new commands -catch-assert and -catch-exceptions insert 3975 catchpoints stopping the program when Ada exceptions are raised. 3976 3977 ** The new command -info-ada-exceptions provides the equivalent of 3978 the new \\"info exceptions\\" command. 3979 3980 * New system-wide configuration scripts 3981 A GDB installation now provides scripts suitable for use as system-wide 3982 configuration scripts for the following systems: 3983 ** ElinOS 3984 ** Wind River Linux 3985 3986 * GDB now supports target-assigned range stepping with remote targets. 3987 This improves the performance of stepping source lines by reducing 3988 the number of control packets from/to GDB. See \\"New remote packets\\" 3989 below. 3990 3991 * GDB now understands the element 'tvar' in the XML traceframe info. 3992 It has the id of the collected trace state variables. 3993 3994 * On S/390 targets that provide the transactional-execution feature, 3995 the program interruption transaction diagnostic block (TDB) is now 3996 represented as a number of additional \\"registers\\" in GDB. 3997 3998 * New remote packets 3999 4000 vCont;r 4001 4002 The vCont packet supports a new 'r' action, that tells the remote 4003 stub to step through an address range itself, without GDB 4004 involvemement at each single-step. 4005 4006 qXfer:libraries-svr4:read's annex 4007 The previously unused annex of the qXfer:libraries-svr4:read packet 4008 is now used to support passing an argument list. The remote stub 4009 reports support for this argument list to GDB's qSupported query. 4010 The defined arguments are \\"start\\" and \\"prev\\", used to reduce work 4011 necessary for library list updating, resulting in significant 4012 speedup. 4013 4014 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 4015 4016 ** GDBserver now supports target-assisted range stepping. Currently 4017 enabled on x86/x86_64 GNU/Linux targets. 4018 4019 ** GDBserver now adds element 'tvar' in the XML in the reply to 4020 'qXfer:traceframe-info:read'. It has the id of the collected 4021 trace state variables. 4022 4023 ** GDBserver now supports hardware watchpoints on the MIPS GNU/Linux 4024 target. 4025 4026 * New 'z' formatter for printing and examining memory, this displays the 4027 value as hexadecimal zero padded on the left to the size of the type. 4028 4029 * GDB can now use Windows x64 unwinding data. 4030 4031 * The \\"set remotebaud\\" command has been replaced by \\"set serial baud\\". 4032 Similarly, \\"show remotebaud\\" has been replaced by \\"show serial baud\\". 4033 The \\"set remotebaud\\" and \\"show remotebaud\\" commands are still available 4034 to provide backward compatibility with older versions of GDB. 4035 4036 *** Changes in GDB 7.6 4037 4038 * Target record has been renamed to record-full. 4039 Record/replay is now enabled with the \\"record full\\" command. 4040 This also affects settings that are associated with full record/replay 4041 that have been moved from \\"set/show record\\" to \\"set/show record full\\": 4042 4043 set|show record full insn-number-max 4044 set|show record full stop-at-limit 4045 set|show record full memory-query 4046 4047 * A new record target \\"record-btrace\\" has been added. The new target 4048 uses hardware support to record the control-flow of a process. It 4049 does not support replaying the execution, but it implements the 4050 below new commands for investigating the recorded execution log. 4051 This new recording method can be enabled using: 4052 4053 record btrace 4054 4055 The \\"record-btrace\\" target is only available on Intel Atom processors 4056 and requires a Linux kernel 2.6.32 or later. 4057 4058 * Two new commands have been added for record/replay to give information 4059 about the recorded execution without having to replay the execution. 4060 The commands are only supported by \\"record btrace\\". 4061 4062 record instruction-history prints the execution history at 4063 instruction granularity 4064 4065 record function-call-history prints the execution history at 4066 function granularity 4067 4068 * New native configurations 4069 4070 ARM AArch64 GNU/Linux aarch64*-*-linux-gnu 4071 FreeBSD/powerpc powerpc*-*-freebsd 4072 x86_64/Cygwin x86_64-*-cygwin* 4073 Tilera TILE-Gx GNU/Linux tilegx*-*-linux-gnu 4074 4075 * New targets 4076 4077 ARM AArch64 aarch64*-*-elf 4078 ARM AArch64 GNU/Linux aarch64*-*-linux 4079 Lynx 178 PowerPC powerpc-*-lynx*178 4080 x86_64/Cygwin x86_64-*-cygwin* 4081 Tilera TILE-Gx GNU/Linux tilegx*-*-linux 4082 4083 * If the configured location of system.gdbinit file (as given by the 4084 --with-system-gdbinit option at configure time) is in the 4085 data-directory (as specified by --with-gdb-datadir at configure 4086 time) or in one of its subdirectories, then GDB will look for the 4087 system-wide init file in the directory specified by the 4088 --data-directory command-line option. 4089 4090 * New command line options: 4091 4092 -nh Disables auto-loading of ~/.gdbinit, but still executes all the 4093 other initialization files, unlike -nx which disables all of them. 4094 4095 * Removed command line options 4096 4097 -epoch This was used by the gdb mode in Epoch, an ancient fork of 4098 Emacs. 4099 4100 * The 'ptype' and 'whatis' commands now accept an argument to control 4101 type formatting. 4102 4103 * 'info proc' now works on some core files. 4104 4105 * Python scripting 4106 4107 ** Vectors can be created with gdb.Type.vector. 4108 4109 ** Python's atexit.register now works in GDB. 4110 4111 ** Types can be pretty-printed via a Python API. 4112 4113 ** Python 3 is now supported (in addition to Python 2.4 or later) 4114 4115 ** New class gdb.Architecture exposes GDB's internal representation 4116 of architecture in the Python API. 4117 4118 ** New method Frame.architecture returns the gdb.Architecture object 4119 corresponding to the frame's architecture. 4120 4121 * New Python-based convenience functions: 4122 4123 ** _memeq(buf1, buf2, length) 4124 ** _streq(str1, str2) 4125 ** _strlen(str) 4126 ** _regex(str, regex) 4127 4128 * The 'cd' command now defaults to using '~' (the home directory) if not 4129 given an argument. 4130 4131 * The C++ ABI now defaults to the GNU v3 ABI. This has been the 4132 default for GCC since November 2000. 4133 4134 * The command 'forward-search' can now be abbreviated as 'fo'. 4135 4136 * The command 'info tracepoints' can now display 'installed on target' 4137 or 'not installed on target' for each non-pending location of tracepoint. 4138 4139 * New configure options 4140 4141 --enable-libmcheck/--disable-libmcheck 4142 By default, development versions are built with -lmcheck on hosts 4143 that support it, in order to help track memory corruption issues. 4144 Release versions, on the other hand, are built without -lmcheck 4145 by default. The --enable-libmcheck/--disable-libmcheck configure 4146 options allow the user to override that default. 4147 --with-babeltrace/--with-babeltrace-include/--with-babeltrace-lib 4148 This configure option allows the user to build GDB with 4149 libbabeltrace using which GDB can read Common Trace Format data. 4150 4151 * New commands (for set/show, see \\"New options\\" below) 4152 4153 catch signal 4154 Catch signals. This is similar to \\"handle\\", but allows commands and 4155 conditions to be attached. 4156 4157 maint info bfds 4158 List the BFDs known to GDB. 4159 4160 python-interactive [command] 4161 pi [command] 4162 Start a Python interactive prompt, or evaluate the optional command 4163 and print the result of expressions. 4164 4165 py [command] 4166 \\"py\\" is a new alias for \\"python\\". 4167 4168 enable type-printer [name]... 4169 disable type-printer [name]... 4170 Enable or disable type printers. 4171 4172 * Removed commands 4173 4174 ** For the Renesas Super-H architecture, the \\"regs\\" command has been removed 4175 (has been deprecated in GDB 7.5), and \\"info all-registers\\" should be used 4176 instead. 4177 4178 * New options 4179 4180 set print type methods (on|off) 4181 show print type methods 4182 Control whether method declarations are displayed by \\"ptype\\". 4183 The default is to show them. 4184 4185 set print type typedefs (on|off) 4186 show print type typedefs 4187 Control whether typedef definitions are displayed by \\"ptype\\". 4188 The default is to show them. 4189 4190 set filename-display basename|relative|absolute 4191 show filename-display 4192 Control the way in which filenames is displayed. 4193 The default is \\"relative\\", which preserves previous behavior. 4194 4195 set trace-buffer-size 4196 show trace-buffer-size 4197 Request target to change the size of trace buffer. 4198 4199 set remote trace-buffer-size-packet auto|on|off 4200 show remote trace-buffer-size-packet 4201 Control the use of the remote protocol \`QTBuffer:size' packet. 4202 4203 set debug aarch64 4204 show debug aarch64 4205 Control display of debugging messages related to ARM AArch64. 4206 The default is off. 4207 4208 set debug coff-pe-read 4209 show debug coff-pe-read 4210 Control display of debugging messages related to reading of COFF/PE 4211 exported symbols. 4212 4213 set debug mach-o 4214 show debug mach-o 4215 Control display of debugging messages related to Mach-O symbols 4216 processing. 4217 4218 set debug notification 4219 show debug notification 4220 Control display of debugging info for async remote notification. 4221 4222 * MI changes 4223 4224 ** Command parameter changes are now notified using new async record 4225 \\"=cmd-param-changed\\". 4226 ** Trace frame changes caused by command \\"tfind\\" are now notified using 4227 new async record \\"=traceframe-changed\\". 4228 ** The creation, deletion and modification of trace state variables 4229 are now notified using new async records \\"=tsv-created\\", 4230 \\"=tsv-deleted\\" and \\"=tsv-modified\\". 4231 ** The start and stop of process record are now notified using new 4232 async record \\"=record-started\\" and \\"=record-stopped\\". 4233 ** Memory changes are now notified using new async record 4234 \\"=memory-changed\\". 4235 ** The data-disassemble command response will include a \\"fullname\\" field 4236 containing the absolute file name when source has been requested. 4237 ** New optional parameter COUNT added to the \\"-data-write-memory-bytes\\" 4238 command, to allow pattern filling of memory areas. 4239 ** New commands \\"-catch-load\\"/\\"-catch-unload\\" added for intercepting 4240 library load/unload events. 4241 ** The response to breakpoint commands and breakpoint async records 4242 includes an \\"installed\\" field containing a boolean state about each 4243 non-pending tracepoint location is whether installed on target or not. 4244 ** Output of the \\"-trace-status\\" command includes a \\"trace-file\\" field 4245 containing the name of the trace file being examined. This field is 4246 optional, and only present when examining a trace file. 4247 ** The \\"fullname\\" field is now always present along with the \\"file\\" field, 4248 even if the file cannot be found by GDB. 4249 4250 * GDB now supports the \\"mini debuginfo\\" section, .gnu_debugdata. 4251 You must have the LZMA library available when configuring GDB for this 4252 feature to be enabled. For more information, see: 4253 http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/MiniDebugInfo 4254 4255 * New remote packets 4256 4257 QTBuffer:size 4258 Set the size of trace buffer. The remote stub reports support for this 4259 packet to gdb's qSupported query. 4260 4261 Qbtrace:bts 4262 Enable Branch Trace Store (BTS)-based branch tracing for the current 4263 thread. The remote stub reports support for this packet to gdb's 4264 qSupported query. 4265 4266 Qbtrace:off 4267 Disable branch tracing for the current thread. The remote stub reports 4268 support for this packet to gdb's qSupported query. 4269 4270 qXfer:btrace:read 4271 Read the traced branches for the current thread. The remote stub 4272 reports support for this packet to gdb's qSupported query. 4273 4274 *** Changes in GDB 7.5 4275 4276 * GDB now supports x32 ABI. Visit <http://sites.google.com/site/x32abi/> 4277 for more x32 ABI info. 4278 4279 * GDB now supports access to MIPS DSP registers on Linux targets. 4280 4281 * GDB now supports debugging microMIPS binaries. 4282 4283 * The \\"info os\\" command on GNU/Linux can now display information on 4284 several new classes of objects managed by the operating system: 4285 \\"info os procgroups\\" lists process groups 4286 \\"info os files\\" lists file descriptors 4287 \\"info os sockets\\" lists internet-domain sockets 4288 \\"info os shm\\" lists shared-memory regions 4289 \\"info os semaphores\\" lists semaphores 4290 \\"info os msg\\" lists message queues 4291 \\"info os modules\\" lists loaded kernel modules 4292 4293 * GDB now has support for SDT (Static Defined Tracing) probes. Currently, 4294 the only implemented backend is for SystemTap probes (<sys/sdt.h>). You 4295 can set a breakpoint using the new \\"-probe, \\"-pstap\\" or \\"-probe-stap\\" 4296 options and inspect the probe arguments using the new _probe_arg family 4297 of convenience variables. You can obtain more information about SystemTap 4298 in <http://sourceware.org/systemtap/>. 4299 4300 * GDB now supports reversible debugging on ARM, it allows you to 4301 debug basic ARM and THUMB instructions, and provides 4302 record/replay support. 4303 4304 * The option \\"symbol-reloading\\" has been deleted as it is no longer used. 4305 4306 * Python scripting 4307 4308 ** GDB commands implemented in Python can now be put in command class 4309 \\"gdb.COMMAND_USER\\". 4310 4311 ** The \\"maint set python print-stack on|off\\" is now deleted. 4312 4313 ** A new class, gdb.printing.FlagEnumerationPrinter, can be used to 4314 apply \\"flag enum\\"-style pretty-printing to any enum. 4315 4316 ** gdb.lookup_symbol can now work when there is no current frame. 4317 4318 ** gdb.Symbol now has a 'line' attribute, holding the line number in 4319 the source at which the symbol was defined. 4320 4321 ** gdb.Symbol now has the new attribute 'needs_frame' and the new 4322 method 'value'. The former indicates whether the symbol needs a 4323 frame in order to compute its value, and the latter computes the 4324 symbol's value. 4325 4326 ** A new method 'referenced_value' on gdb.Value objects which can 4327 dereference pointer as well as C++ reference values. 4328 4329 ** New methods 'global_block' and 'static_block' on gdb.Symtab objects 4330 which return the global and static blocks (as gdb.Block objects), 4331 of the underlying symbol table, respectively. 4332 4333 ** New function gdb.find_pc_line which returns the gdb.Symtab_and_line 4334 object associated with a PC value. 4335 4336 ** gdb.Symtab_and_line has new attribute 'last' which holds the end 4337 of the address range occupied by code for the current source line. 4338 4339 * Go language support. 4340 GDB now supports debugging programs written in the Go programming 4341 language. 4342 4343 * GDBserver now supports stdio connections. 4344 E.g. (gdb) target remote | ssh myhost gdbserver - hello 4345 4346 * The binary \\"gdbtui\\" can no longer be built or installed. 4347 Use \\"gdb -tui\\" instead. 4348 4349 * GDB will now print \\"flag\\" enums specially. A flag enum is one where 4350 all the enumerator values have no bits in common when pairwise 4351 \\"and\\"ed. When printing a value whose type is a flag enum, GDB will 4352 show all the constants, e.g., for enum E { ONE = 1, TWO = 2}: 4353 (gdb) print (enum E) 3 4354 1 = (ONE | TWO) 4355 4356 * The filename part of a linespec will now match trailing components 4357 of a source file name. For example, \\"break gcc/expr.c:1000\\" will 4358 now set a breakpoint in build/gcc/expr.c, but not 4359 build/libcpp/expr.c. 4360 4361 * The \\"info proc\\" and \\"generate-core-file\\" commands will now also 4362 work on remote targets connected to GDBserver on Linux. 4363 4364 * The command \\"info catch\\" has been removed. It has been disabled 4365 since December 2007. 4366 4367 * The \\"catch exception\\" and \\"catch assert\\" commands now accept 4368 a condition at the end of the command, much like the \\"break\\" 4369 command does. For instance: 4370 4371 (gdb) catch exception Constraint_Error if Barrier = True 4372 4373 Previously, it was possible to add a condition to such catchpoints, 4374 but it had to be done as a second step, after the catchpoint had been 4375 created, using the \\"condition\\" command. 4376 4377 * The \\"info static-tracepoint-marker\\" command will now also work on 4378 native Linux targets with in-process agent. 4379 4380 * GDB can now set breakpoints on inlined functions. 4381 4382 * The .gdb_index section has been updated to include symbols for 4383 inlined functions. GDB will ignore older .gdb_index sections by 4384 default, which could cause symbol files to be loaded more slowly 4385 until their .gdb_index sections can be recreated. The new command 4386 \\"set use-deprecated-index-sections on\\" will cause GDB to use any older 4387 .gdb_index sections it finds. This will restore performance, but the 4388 ability to set breakpoints on inlined functions will be lost in symbol 4389 files with older .gdb_index sections. 4390 4391 The .gdb_index section has also been updated to record more information 4392 about each symbol. This speeds up the \\"info variables\\", \\"info functions\\" 4393 and \\"info types\\" commands when used with programs having the .gdb_index 4394 section, as well as speeding up debugging with shared libraries using 4395 the .gdb_index section. 4396 4397 * Ada support for GDB/MI Variable Objects has been added. 4398 4399 * GDB can now support 'breakpoint always-inserted mode' in 'record' 4400 target. 4401 4402 * MI changes 4403 4404 ** New command -info-os is the MI equivalent of \\"info os\\". 4405 4406 ** Output logs (\\"set logging\\" and related) now include MI output. 4407 4408 * New commands 4409 4410 ** \\"set use-deprecated-index-sections on|off\\" 4411 \\"show use-deprecated-index-sections on|off\\" 4412 Controls the use of deprecated .gdb_index sections. 4413 4414 ** \\"catch load\\" and \\"catch unload\\" can be used to stop when a shared 4415 library is loaded or unloaded, respectively. 4416 4417 ** \\"enable count\\" can be used to auto-disable a breakpoint after 4418 several hits. 4419 4420 ** \\"info vtbl\\" can be used to show the virtual method tables for 4421 C++ and Java objects. 4422 4423 ** \\"explore\\" and its sub commands \\"explore value\\" and \\"explore type\\" 4424 can be used to recursively explore values and types of 4425 expressions. These commands are available only if GDB is 4426 configured with '--with-python'. 4427 4428 ** \\"info auto-load\\" shows status of all kinds of auto-loaded files, 4429 \\"info auto-load gdb-scripts\\" shows status of auto-loading GDB canned 4430 sequences of commands files, \\"info auto-load python-scripts\\" 4431 shows status of auto-loading Python script files, 4432 \\"info auto-load local-gdbinit\\" shows status of loading init file 4433 (.gdbinit) from current directory and \\"info auto-load libthread-db\\" shows 4434 status of inferior specific thread debugging shared library loading. 4435 4436 ** \\"info auto-load-scripts\\", \\"set auto-load-scripts on|off\\" 4437 and \\"show auto-load-scripts\\" commands have been deprecated, use their 4438 \\"info auto-load python-scripts\\", \\"set auto-load python-scripts on|off\\" 4439 and \\"show auto-load python-scripts\\" counterparts instead. 4440 4441 ** \\"dprintf location,format,args...\\" creates a dynamic printf, which 4442 is basically a breakpoint that does a printf and immediately 4443 resumes your program's execution, so it is like a printf that you 4444 can insert dynamically at runtime instead of at compiletime. 4445 4446 ** \\"set print symbol\\" 4447 \\"show print symbol\\" 4448 Controls whether GDB attempts to display the symbol, if any, 4449 corresponding to addresses it prints. This defaults to \\"on\\", but 4450 you can set it to \\"off\\" to restore GDB's previous behavior. 4451 4452 * Deprecated commands 4453 4454 ** For the Renesas Super-H architecture, the \\"regs\\" command has been 4455 deprecated, and \\"info all-registers\\" should be used instead. 4456 4457 * New targets 4458 4459 Renesas RL78 rl78-*-elf 4460 HP OpenVMS ia64 ia64-hp-openvms* 4461 4462 * GDBserver supports evaluation of breakpoint conditions. When 4463 support is advertised by GDBserver, GDB may be told to send the 4464 breakpoint conditions in bytecode form to GDBserver. GDBserver 4465 will only report the breakpoint trigger to GDB when its condition 4466 evaluates to true. 4467 4468 * New options 4469 4470 set mips compression 4471 show mips compression 4472 Select the compressed ISA encoding used in functions that have no symbol 4473 information available. The encoding can be set to either of: 4474 mips16 4475 micromips 4476 and is updated automatically from ELF file flags if available. 4477 4478 set breakpoint condition-evaluation 4479 show breakpoint condition-evaluation 4480 Control whether breakpoint conditions are evaluated by GDB (\\"host\\") or by 4481 GDBserver (\\"target\\"). Default option \\"auto\\" chooses the most efficient 4482 available mode. 4483 This option can improve debugger efficiency depending on the speed of the 4484 target. 4485 4486 set auto-load off 4487 Disable auto-loading globally. 4488 4489 show auto-load 4490 Show auto-loading setting of all kinds of auto-loaded files. 4491 4492 set auto-load gdb-scripts on|off 4493 show auto-load gdb-scripts 4494 Control auto-loading of GDB canned sequences of commands files. 4495 4496 set auto-load python-scripts on|off 4497 show auto-load python-scripts 4498 Control auto-loading of Python script files. 4499 4500 set auto-load local-gdbinit on|off 4501 show auto-load local-gdbinit 4502 Control loading of init file (.gdbinit) from current directory. 4503 4504 set auto-load libthread-db on|off 4505 show auto-load libthread-db 4506 Control auto-loading of inferior specific thread debugging shared library. 4507 4508 set auto-load scripts-directory <dir1>[:<dir2>...] 4509 show auto-load scripts-directory 4510 Set a list of directories from which to load auto-loaded scripts. 4511 Automatically loaded Python scripts and GDB scripts are located in one 4512 of the directories listed by this option. 4513 The delimiter (':' above) may differ according to the host platform. 4514 4515 set auto-load safe-path <dir1>[:<dir2>...] 4516 show auto-load safe-path 4517 Set a list of directories from which it is safe to auto-load files. 4518 The delimiter (':' above) may differ according to the host platform. 4519 4520 set debug auto-load on|off 4521 show debug auto-load 4522 Control display of debugging info for auto-loading the files above. 4523 4524 set dprintf-style gdb|call|agent 4525 show dprintf-style 4526 Control the way in which a dynamic printf is performed; \\"gdb\\" 4527 requests a GDB printf command, while \\"call\\" causes dprintf to call a 4528 function in the inferior. \\"agent\\" requests that the target agent 4529 (such as GDBserver) do the printing. 4530 4531 set dprintf-function <expr> 4532 show dprintf-function 4533 set dprintf-channel <expr> 4534 show dprintf-channel 4535 Set the function and optional first argument to the call when using 4536 the \\"call\\" style of dynamic printf. 4537 4538 set disconnected-dprintf on|off 4539 show disconnected-dprintf 4540 Control whether agent-style dynamic printfs continue to be in effect 4541 after GDB disconnects. 4542 4543 * New configure options 4544 4545 --with-auto-load-dir 4546 Configure default value for the 'set auto-load scripts-directory' 4547 setting above. It defaults to 'debugdir:datadir/auto-load', 4548 debugdir representing global debugging info directories (available 4549 via 'show debug-file-directory') and datadir representing GDB's data 4550 directory (available via 'show data-directory'). 4551 4552 --with-auto-load-safe-path 4553 Configure default value for the 'set auto-load safe-path' setting 4554 above. It defaults to the --with-auto-load-dir setting. 4555 4556 --without-auto-load-safe-path 4557 Set 'set auto-load safe-path' to '/', effectively disabling this 4558 security feature. 4559 4560 * New remote packets 4561 4562 z0/z1 conditional breakpoints extension 4563 4564 The z0/z1 breakpoint insertion packets have been extended to carry 4565 a list of conditional expressions over to the remote stub depending on the 4566 condition evaluation mode. The use of this extension can be controlled 4567 via the \\"set remote conditional-breakpoints-packet\\" command. 4568 4569 QProgramSignals: 4570 4571 Specify the signals which the remote stub may pass to the debugged 4572 program without GDB involvement. 4573 4574 * New command line options 4575 4576 --init-command=FILE, -ix Like --command, -x but execute it 4577 before loading inferior. 4578 --init-eval-command=COMMAND, -iex Like --eval-command=COMMAND, -ex but 4579 execute it before loading inferior. 4580 4581 *** Changes in GDB 7.4 4582 4583 * GDB now handles ambiguous linespecs more consistently; the existing 4584 FILE:LINE support has been expanded to other types of linespecs. A 4585 breakpoint will now be set on all matching locations in all 4586 inferiors, and locations will be added or removed according to 4587 inferior changes. 4588 4589 * GDB now allows you to skip uninteresting functions and files when 4590 stepping with the \\"skip function\\" and \\"skip file\\" commands. 4591 4592 * GDB has two new commands: \\"set remote hardware-watchpoint-length-limit\\" 4593 and \\"show remote hardware-watchpoint-length-limit\\". These allows to 4594 set or show the maximum length limit (in bytes) of a remote 4595 target hardware watchpoint. 4596 4597 This allows e.g. to use \\"unlimited\\" hardware watchpoints with the 4598 gdbserver integrated in Valgrind version >= 3.7.0. Such Valgrind 4599 watchpoints are slower than real hardware watchpoints but are 4600 significantly faster than gdb software watchpoints. 4601 4602 * Python scripting 4603 4604 ** The register_pretty_printer function in module gdb.printing now takes 4605 an optional \`replace' argument. If True, the new printer replaces any 4606 existing one. 4607 4608 ** The \\"maint set python print-stack on|off\\" command has been 4609 deprecated and will be deleted in GDB 7.5. 4610 A new command: \\"set python print-stack none|full|message\\" has 4611 replaced it. Additionally, the default for \\"print-stack\\" is 4612 now \\"message\\", which just prints the error message without 4613 the stack trace. 4614 4615 ** A prompt substitution hook (prompt_hook) is now available to the 4616 Python API. 4617 4618 ** A new Python module, gdb.prompt has been added to the GDB Python 4619 modules library. This module provides functionality for 4620 escape sequences in prompts (used by set/show 4621 extended-prompt). These escape sequences are replaced by their 4622 corresponding value. 4623 4624 ** Python commands and convenience-functions located in 4625 'data-directory'/python/gdb/command and 4626 'data-directory'/python/gdb/function are now automatically loaded 4627 on GDB start-up. 4628 4629 ** Blocks now provide four new attributes. global_block and 4630 static_block will return the global and static blocks 4631 respectively. is_static and is_global are boolean attributes 4632 that indicate if the block is one of those two types. 4633 4634 ** Symbols now provide the \\"type\\" attribute, the type of the symbol. 4635 4636 ** The \\"gdb.breakpoint\\" function has been deprecated in favor of 4637 \\"gdb.breakpoints\\". 4638 4639 ** A new class \\"gdb.FinishBreakpoint\\" is provided to catch the return 4640 of a function. This class is based on the \\"finish\\" command 4641 available in the CLI. 4642 4643 ** Type objects for struct and union types now allow access to 4644 the fields using standard Python dictionary (mapping) methods. 4645 For example, \\"some_type['myfield']\\" now works, as does 4646 \\"some_type.items()\\". 4647 4648 ** A new event \\"gdb.new_objfile\\" has been added, triggered by loading a 4649 new object file. 4650 4651 ** A new function, \\"deep_items\\" has been added to the gdb.types 4652 module in the GDB Python modules library. This function returns 4653 an iterator over the fields of a struct or union type. Unlike 4654 the standard Python \\"iteritems\\" method, it will recursively traverse 4655 any anonymous fields. 4656 4657 * MI changes 4658 4659 ** \\"*stopped\\" events can report several new \\"reason\\"s, such as 4660 \\"solib-event\\". 4661 4662 ** Breakpoint changes are now notified using new async records, like 4663 \\"=breakpoint-modified\\". 4664 4665 ** New command -ada-task-info. 4666 4667 * libthread-db-search-path now supports two special values: sdir and pdir. 4668 sdir specifies the default system locations of shared libraries. 4669 pdir specifies the directory where the libpthread used by the application 4670 lives. 4671 4672 GDB no longer looks in sdir and pdir after it has searched the directories 4673 mentioned in libthread-db-search-path. If you want to search those 4674 directories, they must be specified in libthread-db-search-path. 4675 The default value of libthread-db-search-path on GNU/Linux and Solaris 4676 systems is now \\"sdir:pdir\\". 4677 4678 pdir is not supported by gdbserver, it is currently ignored. 4679 sdir is supported by gdbserver. 4680 4681 * New configure option --with-iconv-bin. 4682 When using the internationalization support like the one in the GNU C 4683 library, GDB will invoke the \\"iconv\\" program to get a list of supported 4684 character sets. If this program lives in a non-standard location, one can 4685 use this option to specify where to find it. 4686 4687 * When natively debugging programs on PowerPC BookE processors running 4688 a Linux kernel version 2.6.34 or later, GDB supports masked hardware 4689 watchpoints, which specify a mask in addition to an address to watch. 4690 The mask specifies that some bits of an address (the bits which are 4691 reset in the mask) should be ignored when matching the address accessed 4692 by the inferior against the watchpoint address. See the \\"PowerPC Embedded\\" 4693 section in the user manual for more details. 4694 4695 * The new option --once causes GDBserver to stop listening for connections once 4696 the first connection is made. The listening port used by GDBserver will 4697 become available after that. 4698 4699 * New commands \\"info macros\\" and \\"alias\\" have been added. 4700 4701 * New function parameters suffix @entry specifies value of function parameter 4702 at the time the function got called. Entry values are available only since 4703 gcc version 4.7. 4704 4705 * New commands 4706 4707 !SHELL COMMAND 4708 \\"!\\" is now an alias of the \\"shell\\" command. 4709 Note that no space is needed between \\"!\\" and SHELL COMMAND. 4710 4711 * Changed commands 4712 4713 watch EXPRESSION mask MASK_VALUE 4714 The watch command now supports the mask argument which allows creation 4715 of masked watchpoints, if the current architecture supports this feature. 4716 4717 info auto-load-scripts [REGEXP] 4718 This command was formerly named \\"maintenance print section-scripts\\". 4719 It is now generally useful and is no longer a maintenance-only command. 4720 4721 info macro [-all] [--] MACRO 4722 The info macro command has new options \`-all' and \`--'. The first for 4723 printing all definitions of a macro. The second for explicitly specifying 4724 the end of arguments and the beginning of the macro name in case the macro 4725 name starts with a hyphen. 4726 4727 collect[/s] EXPRESSIONS 4728 The tracepoint collect command now takes an optional modifier \\"/s\\" 4729 that directs it to dereference pointer-to-character types and 4730 collect the bytes of memory up to a zero byte. The behavior is 4731 similar to what you see when you use the regular print command on a 4732 string. An optional integer following the \\"/s\\" sets a bound on the 4733 number of bytes that will be collected. 4734 4735 tstart [NOTES] 4736 The trace start command now interprets any supplied arguments as a 4737 note to be recorded with the trace run, with an effect similar to 4738 setting the variable trace-notes. 4739 4740 tstop [NOTES] 4741 The trace stop command now interprets any arguments as a note to be 4742 mentioned along with the tstatus report that the trace was stopped 4743 with a command. The effect is similar to setting the variable 4744 trace-stop-notes. 4745 4746 * Tracepoints can now be enabled and disabled at any time after a trace 4747 experiment has been started using the standard \\"enable\\" and \\"disable\\" 4748 commands. It is now possible to start a trace experiment with no enabled 4749 tracepoints; GDB will display a warning, but will allow the experiment to 4750 begin, assuming that tracepoints will be enabled as needed while the trace 4751 is running. 4752 4753 * Fast tracepoints on 32-bit x86-architectures can now be placed at 4754 locations with 4-byte instructions, when they were previously 4755 limited to locations with instructions of 5 bytes or longer. 4756 4757 * New options 4758 4759 set debug dwarf2-read 4760 show debug dwarf2-read 4761 Turns on or off display of debugging messages related to reading 4762 DWARF debug info. The default is off. 4763 4764 set debug symtab-create 4765 show debug symtab-create 4766 Turns on or off display of debugging messages related to symbol table 4767 creation. The default is off. 4768 4769 set extended-prompt 4770 show extended-prompt 4771 Set the GDB prompt, and allow escape sequences to be inserted to 4772 display miscellaneous information (see 'help set extended-prompt' 4773 for the list of sequences). This prompt (and any information 4774 accessed through the escape sequences) is updated every time the 4775 prompt is displayed. 4776 4777 set print entry-values (both|compact|default|if-needed|no|only|preferred) 4778 show print entry-values 4779 Set printing of frame argument values at function entry. In some cases 4780 GDB can determine the value of function argument which was passed by the 4781 function caller, even if the value was modified inside the called function. 4782 4783 set debug entry-values 4784 show debug entry-values 4785 Control display of debugging info for determining frame argument values at 4786 function entry and virtual tail call frames. 4787 4788 set basenames-may-differ 4789 show basenames-may-differ 4790 Set whether a source file may have multiple base names. 4791 (A \\"base name\\" is the name of a file with the directory part removed. 4792 Example: The base name of \\"/home/user/hello.c\\" is \\"hello.c\\".) 4793 If set, GDB will canonicalize file names (e.g., expand symlinks) 4794 before comparing them. Canonicalization is an expensive operation, 4795 but it allows the same file be known by more than one base name. 4796 If not set (the default), all source files are assumed to have just 4797 one base name, and gdb will do file name comparisons more efficiently. 4798 4799 set trace-user 4800 show trace-user 4801 set trace-notes 4802 show trace-notes 4803 Set a user name and notes for the current and any future trace runs. 4804 This is useful for long-running and/or disconnected traces, to 4805 inform others (or yourself) as to who is running the trace, supply 4806 contact information, or otherwise explain what is going on. 4807 4808 set trace-stop-notes 4809 show trace-stop-notes 4810 Set a note attached to the trace run, that is displayed when the 4811 trace has been stopped by a tstop command. This is useful for 4812 instance as an explanation, if you are stopping a trace run that was 4813 started by someone else. 4814 4815 * New remote packets 4816 4817 QTEnable 4818 4819 Dynamically enable a tracepoint in a started trace experiment. 4820 4821 QTDisable 4822 4823 Dynamically disable a tracepoint in a started trace experiment. 4824 4825 QTNotes 4826 4827 Set the user and notes of the trace run. 4828 4829 qTP 4830 4831 Query the current status of a tracepoint. 4832 4833 qTMinFTPILen 4834 4835 Query the minimum length of instruction at which a fast tracepoint may 4836 be placed. 4837 4838 * Dcache size (number of lines) and line-size are now runtime-configurable 4839 via \\"set dcache line\\" and \\"set dcache line-size\\" commands. 4840 4841 * New targets 4842 4843 Texas Instruments TMS320C6x tic6x-*-* 4844 4845 * New Simulators 4846 4847 Renesas RL78 rl78-*-elf 4848 4849 *** Changes in GDB 7.3.1 4850 4851 * The build failure for NetBSD and OpenBSD targets have now been fixed. 4852 4853 *** Changes in GDB 7.3 4854 4855 * GDB has a new command: \\"thread find [REGEXP]\\". 4856 It finds the thread id whose name, target id, or thread extra info 4857 matches the given regular expression. 4858 4859 * The \\"catch syscall\\" command now works on mips*-linux* targets. 4860 4861 * The -data-disassemble MI command now supports modes 2 and 3 for 4862 dumping the instruction opcodes. 4863 4864 * New command line options 4865 4866 -data-directory DIR Specify DIR as the \\"data-directory\\". 4867 This is mostly for testing purposes. 4868 4869 * The \\"maint set python auto-load on|off\\" command has been renamed to 4870 \\"set auto-load-scripts on|off\\". 4871 4872 * GDB has a new command: \\"set directories\\". 4873 It is like the \\"dir\\" command except that it replaces the 4874 source path list instead of augmenting it. 4875 4876 * GDB now understands thread names. 4877 4878 On GNU/Linux, \\"info threads\\" will display the thread name as set by 4879 prctl or pthread_setname_np. 4880 4881 There is also a new command, \\"thread name\\", which can be used to 4882 assign a name internally for GDB to display. 4883 4884 * OpenCL C 4885 Initial support for the OpenCL C language (http://www.khronos.org/opencl) 4886 has been integrated into GDB. 4887 4888 * Python scripting 4889 4890 ** The function gdb.Write now accepts an optional keyword 'stream'. 4891 This keyword, when provided, will direct the output to either 4892 stdout, stderr, or GDB's logging output. 4893 4894 ** Parameters can now be be sub-classed in Python, and in particular 4895 you may implement the get_set_doc and get_show_doc functions. 4896 This improves how Parameter set/show documentation is processed 4897 and allows for more dynamic content. 4898 4899 ** Symbols, Symbol Table, Symbol Table and Line, Object Files, 4900 Inferior, Inferior Thread, Blocks, and Block Iterator APIs now 4901 have an is_valid method. 4902 4903 ** Breakpoints can now be sub-classed in Python, and in particular 4904 you may implement a 'stop' function that is executed each time 4905 the inferior reaches that breakpoint. 4906 4907 ** New function gdb.lookup_global_symbol looks up a global symbol. 4908 4909 ** GDB values in Python are now callable if the value represents a 4910 function. For example, if 'some_value' represents a function that 4911 takes two integer parameters and returns a value, you can call 4912 that function like so: 4913 4914 result = some_value (10,20) 4915 4916 ** Module gdb.types has been added. 4917 It contains a collection of utilities for working with gdb.Types objects: 4918 get_basic_type, has_field, make_enum_dict. 4919 4920 ** Module gdb.printing has been added. 4921 It contains utilities for writing and registering pretty-printers. 4922 New classes: PrettyPrinter, SubPrettyPrinter, 4923 RegexpCollectionPrettyPrinter. 4924 New function: register_pretty_printer. 4925 4926 ** New commands \\"info pretty-printers\\", \\"enable pretty-printer\\" and 4927 \\"disable pretty-printer\\" have been added. 4928 4929 ** gdb.parameter(\\"directories\\") is now available. 4930 4931 ** New function gdb.newest_frame returns the newest frame in the 4932 selected thread. 4933 4934 ** The gdb.InferiorThread class has a new \\"name\\" attribute. This 4935 holds the thread's name. 4936 4937 ** Python Support for Inferior events. 4938 Python scripts can add observers to be notified of events 4939 occurring in the process being debugged. 4940 The following events are currently supported: 4941 - gdb.events.cont Continue event. 4942 - gdb.events.exited Inferior exited event. 4943 - gdb.events.stop Signal received, and Breakpoint hit events. 4944 4945 * C++ Improvements: 4946 4947 ** GDB now puts template parameters in scope when debugging in an 4948 instantiation. For example, if you have: 4949 4950 template<int X> int func (void) { return X; } 4951 4952 then if you step into func<5>, \\"print X\\" will show \\"5\\". This 4953 feature requires proper debuginfo support from the compiler; it 4954 was added to GCC 4.5. 4955 4956 ** The motion commands \\"next\\", \\"finish\\", \\"until\\", and \\"advance\\" now 4957 work better when exceptions are thrown. In particular, GDB will 4958 no longer lose control of the inferior; instead, the GDB will 4959 stop the inferior at the point at which the exception is caught. 4960 This functionality requires a change in the exception handling 4961 code that was introduced in GCC 4.5. 4962 4963 * GDB now follows GCC's rules on accessing volatile objects when 4964 reading or writing target state during expression evaluation. 4965 One notable difference to prior behavior is that \\"print x = 0\\" 4966 no longer generates a read of x; the value of the assignment is 4967 now always taken directly from the value being assigned. 4968 4969 * GDB now has some support for using labels in the program's source in 4970 linespecs. For instance, you can use \\"advance label\\" to continue 4971 execution to a label. 4972 4973 * GDB now has support for reading and writing a new .gdb_index 4974 section. This section holds a fast index of DWARF debugging 4975 information and can be used to greatly speed up GDB startup and 4976 operation. See the documentation for \`save gdb-index' for details. 4977 4978 * The \\"watch\\" command now accepts an optional \\"-location\\" argument. 4979 When used, this causes GDB to watch the memory referred to by the 4980 expression. Such a watchpoint is never deleted due to it going out 4981 of scope. 4982 4983 * GDB now supports thread debugging of core dumps on GNU/Linux. 4984 4985 GDB now activates thread debugging using the libthread_db library 4986 when debugging GNU/Linux core dumps, similarly to when debugging 4987 live processes. As a result, when debugging a core dump file, GDB 4988 is now able to display pthread_t ids of threads. For example, \\"info 4989 threads\\" shows the same output as when debugging the process when it 4990 was live. In earlier releases, you'd see something like this: 4991 4992 (gdb) info threads 4993 * 1 LWP 6780 main () at main.c:10 4994 4995 While now you see this: 4996 4997 (gdb) info threads 4998 * 1 Thread 0x7f0f5712a700 (LWP 6780) main () at main.c:10 4999 5000 It is also now possible to inspect TLS variables when debugging core 5001 dumps. 5002 5003 When debugging a core dump generated on a machine other than the one 5004 used to run GDB, you may need to point GDB at the correct 5005 libthread_db library with the \\"set libthread-db-search-path\\" 5006 command. See the user manual for more details on this command. 5007 5008 * When natively debugging programs on PowerPC BookE processors running 5009 a Linux kernel version 2.6.34 or later, GDB supports ranged breakpoints, 5010 which stop execution of the inferior whenever it executes an instruction 5011 at any address within the specified range. See the \\"PowerPC Embedded\\" 5012 section in the user manual for more details. 5013 5014 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 5015 5016 ** GDBserver is now supported on PowerPC LynxOS (versions 4.x and 5.x), 5017 and i686 LynxOS (version 5.x). 5018 5019 ** GDBserver is now supported on Blackfin Linux. 5020 5021 * New native configurations 5022 5023 ia64 HP-UX ia64-*-hpux* 5024 5025 * New targets: 5026 5027 Analog Devices, Inc. Blackfin Processor bfin-* 5028 5029 * Ada task switching is now supported on sparc-elf targets when 5030 debugging a program using the Ravenscar Profile. For more information, 5031 see the \\"Tasking Support when using the Ravenscar Profile\\" section 5032 in the GDB user manual. 5033 5034 * Guile support was removed. 5035 5036 * New features in the GNU simulator 5037 5038 ** The --map-info flag lists all known core mappings. 5039 5040 ** CFI flashes may be simulated via the \\"cfi\\" device. 5041 5042 *** Changes in GDB 7.2 5043 5044 * Shared library support for remote targets by default 5045 5046 When GDB is configured for a generic, non-OS specific target, like 5047 for example, --target=arm-eabi or one of the many *-*-elf targets, 5048 GDB now queries remote stubs for loaded shared libraries using the 5049 \`qXfer:libraries:read' packet. Previously, shared library support 5050 was always disabled for such configurations. 5051 5052 * C++ Improvements: 5053 5054 ** Argument Dependent Lookup (ADL) 5055 5056 In C++ ADL lookup directs function search to the namespaces of its 5057 arguments even if the namespace has not been imported. 5058 For example: 5059 namespace A 5060 { 5061 class B { }; 5062 void foo (B) { } 5063 } 5064 ... 5065 A::B b 5066 foo(b) 5067 Here the compiler will search for \`foo' in the namespace of 'b' 5068 and find A::foo. GDB now supports this. This construct is commonly 5069 used in the Standard Template Library for operators. 5070 5071 ** Improved User Defined Operator Support 5072 5073 In addition to member operators, GDB now supports lookup of operators 5074 defined in a namespace and imported with a \`using' directive, operators 5075 defined in the global scope, operators imported implicitly from an 5076 anonymous namespace, and the ADL operators mentioned in the previous 5077 entry. 5078 GDB now also supports proper overload resolution for all the previously 5079 mentioned flavors of operators. 5080 5081 ** static const class members 5082 5083 Printing of static const class members that are initialized in the 5084 class definition has been fixed. 5085 5086 * Windows Thread Information Block access. 5087 5088 On Windows targets, GDB now supports displaying the Windows Thread 5089 Information Block (TIB) structure. This structure is visible either 5090 by using the new command \`info w32 thread-information-block' or, by 5091 dereferencing the new convenience variable named \`_tlb', a 5092 thread-specific pointer to the TIB. This feature is also supported 5093 when remote debugging using GDBserver. 5094 5095 * Static tracepoints 5096 5097 Static tracepoints are calls in the user program into a tracing 5098 library. One such library is a port of the LTTng kernel tracer to 5099 userspace --- UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer, http://lttng.org/ust). 5100 When debugging with GDBserver, GDB now supports combining the GDB 5101 tracepoint machinery with such libraries. For example: the user can 5102 use GDB to probe a static tracepoint marker (a call from the user 5103 program into the tracing library) with the new \\"strace\\" command (see 5104 \\"New commands\\" below). This creates a \\"static tracepoint\\" in the 5105 breakpoint list, that can be manipulated with the same feature set 5106 as fast and regular tracepoints. E.g., collect registers, local and 5107 global variables, collect trace state variables, and define 5108 tracepoint conditions. In addition, the user can collect extra 5109 static tracepoint marker specific data, by collecting the new 5110 _sdata internal variable. When analyzing the trace buffer, you can 5111 inspect _sdata like any other variable available to GDB. For more 5112 information, see the \\"Tracepoints\\" chapter in GDB user manual. New 5113 remote packets have been defined to support static tracepoints, see 5114 the \\"New remote packets\\" section below. 5115 5116 * Better reconstruction of tracepoints after disconnected tracing 5117 5118 GDB will attempt to download the original source form of tracepoint 5119 definitions when starting a trace run, and then will upload these 5120 upon reconnection to the target, resulting in a more accurate 5121 reconstruction of the tracepoints that are in use on the target. 5122 5123 * Observer mode 5124 5125 You can now exercise direct control over the ways that GDB can 5126 affect your program. For instance, you can disallow the setting of 5127 breakpoints, so that the program can run continuously (assuming 5128 non-stop mode). In addition, the \\"observer\\" variable is available 5129 to switch all of the different controls; in observer mode, GDB 5130 cannot affect the target's behavior at all, which is useful for 5131 tasks like diagnosing live systems in the field. 5132 5133 * The new convenience variable _thread holds the number of the 5134 current thread. 5135 5136 * New remote packets 5137 5138 qGetTIBAddr 5139 5140 Return the address of the Windows Thread Information Block of a given thread. 5141 5142 qRelocInsn 5143 5144 In response to several of the tracepoint packets, the target may now 5145 also respond with a number of intermediate \`qRelocInsn' request 5146 packets before the final result packet, to have GDB handle 5147 relocating an instruction to execute at a different address. This 5148 is particularly useful for stubs that support fast tracepoints. GDB 5149 reports support for this feature in the qSupported packet. 5150 5151 qTfSTM, qTsSTM 5152 5153 List static tracepoint markers in the target program. 5154 5155 qTSTMat 5156 5157 List static tracepoint markers at a given address in the target 5158 program. 5159 5160 qXfer:statictrace:read 5161 5162 Read the static trace data collected (by a \`collect _sdata' 5163 tracepoint action). The remote stub reports support for this packet 5164 to gdb's qSupported query. 5165 5166 QAllow 5167 5168 Send the current settings of GDB's permission flags. 5169 5170 QTDPsrc 5171 5172 Send part of the source (textual) form of a tracepoint definition, 5173 which includes location, conditional, and action list. 5174 5175 * The source command now accepts a -s option to force searching for the 5176 script in the source search path even if the script name specifies 5177 a directory. 5178 5179 * New features in the GDB remote stub, GDBserver 5180 5181 - GDBserver now support tracepoints (including fast tracepoints, and 5182 static tracepoints). The feature is currently supported by the 5183 i386-linux and amd64-linux builds. See the \\"Tracepoints support 5184 in gdbserver\\" section in the manual for more information. 5185 5186 GDBserver JIT compiles the tracepoint's conditional agent 5187 expression bytecode into native code whenever possible for low 5188 overhead dynamic tracepoints conditionals. For such tracepoints, 5189 an expression that examines program state is evaluated when the 5190 tracepoint is reached, in order to determine whether to capture 5191 trace data. If the condition is simple and false, processing the 5192 tracepoint finishes very quickly and no data is gathered. 5193 5194 GDBserver interfaces with the UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer) library 5195 for static tracepoints support. 5196 5197 - GDBserver now supports x86_64 Windows 64-bit debugging. 5198 5199 * GDB now sends xmlRegisters= in qSupported packet to indicate that 5200 it understands register description. 5201 5202 * The --batch flag now disables pagination and queries. 5203 5204 * X86 general purpose registers 5205 5206 GDB now supports reading/writing byte, word and double-word x86 5207 general purpose registers directly. This means you can use, say, 5208 ah or ax to refer, respectively, to the byte register AH and 5209 16-bit word register AX that are actually portions of the 32-bit 5210 register EAX or 64-bit register RAX. 5211 5212 * The \`commands' command now accepts a range of breakpoints to modify. 5213 A plain \`commands' following a command that creates multiple 5214 breakpoints affects all the breakpoints set by that command. This 5215 applies to breakpoints set by \`rbreak', and also applies when a 5216 single \`break' command creates multiple breakpoints (e.g., 5217 breakpoints on overloaded c++ functions). 5218 5219 * The \`rbreak' command now accepts a filename specification as part of 5220 its argument, limiting the functions selected by the regex to those 5221 in the specified file. 5222 5223 * Support for remote debugging Windows and SymbianOS shared libraries 5224 from Unix hosts has been improved. Non Windows GDB builds now can 5225 understand target reported file names that follow MS-DOS based file 5226 system semantics, such as file names that include drive letters and 5227 use the backslash character as directory separator. This makes it 5228 possible to transparently use the \\"set sysroot\\" and \\"set 5229 solib-search-path\\" on Unix hosts to point as host copies of the 5230 target's shared libraries. See the new command \\"set 5231 target-file-system-kind\\" described below, and the \\"Commands to 5232 specify files\\" section in the user manual for more information. 5233 5234 * New commands 5235 5236 eval template, expressions... 5237 Convert the values of one or more expressions under the control 5238 of the string template to a command line, and call it. 5239 5240 set target-file-system-kind unix|dos-based|auto 5241 show target-file-system-kind 5242 Set or show the assumed file system kind for target reported file 5243 names. 5244 5245 save breakpoints <filename> 5246 Save all current breakpoint definitions to a file suitable for use 5247 in a later debugging session. To read the saved breakpoint 5248 definitions, use the \`source' command. 5249 5250 \`save tracepoints' is a new alias for \`save-tracepoints'. The latter 5251 is now deprecated. 5252 5253 info static-tracepoint-markers 5254 Display information about static tracepoint markers in the target. 5255 5256 strace FN | FILE:LINE | *ADDR | -m MARKER_ID 5257 Define a static tracepoint by probing a marker at the given 5258 function, line, address, or marker ID. 5259 5260 set observer on|off 5261 show observer 5262 Enable and disable observer mode. 5263 5264 set may-write-registers on|off 5265 set may-write-memory on|off 5266 set may-insert-breakpoints on|off 5267 set may-insert-tracepoints on|off 5268 set may-insert-fast-tracepoints on|off 5269 set may-interrupt on|off 5270 Set individual permissions for GDB effects on the target. Note that 5271 some of these settings can have undesirable or surprising 5272 consequences, particularly when changed in the middle of a session. 5273 For instance, disabling the writing of memory can prevent 5274 breakpoints from being inserted, cause single-stepping to fail, or 5275 even crash your program, if you disable after breakpoints have been 5276 inserted. However, GDB should not crash. 5277 5278 set record memory-query on|off 5279 show record memory-query 5280 Control whether to stop the inferior if memory changes caused 5281 by an instruction cannot be recorded. 5282 5283 * Changed commands 5284 5285 disassemble 5286 The disassemble command now supports \\"start,+length\\" form of two arguments. 5287 5288 * Python scripting 5289 5290 ** GDB now provides a new directory location, called the python directory, 5291 where Python scripts written for GDB can be installed. The location 5292 of that directory is <data-directory>/python, where <data-directory> 5293 is the GDB data directory. For more details, see section \`Scripting 5294 GDB using Python' in the manual. 5295 5296 ** The GDB Python API now has access to breakpoints, symbols, symbol 5297 tables, program spaces, inferiors, threads and frame's code blocks. 5298 Additionally, GDB Parameters can now be created from the API, and 5299 manipulated via set/show in the CLI. 5300 5301 ** New functions gdb.target_charset, gdb.target_wide_charset, 5302 gdb.progspaces, gdb.current_progspace, and gdb.string_to_argv. 5303 5304 ** New exception gdb.GdbError. 5305 5306 ** Pretty-printers are now also looked up in the current program space. 5307 5308 ** Pretty-printers can now be individually enabled and disabled. 5309 5310 ** GDB now looks for names of Python scripts to auto-load in a 5311 special section named \`.debug_gdb_scripts', in addition to looking 5312 for a OBJFILE-gdb.py script when OBJFILE is read by the debugger. 5313 5314 * Tracepoint actions were unified with breakpoint commands. In particular, 5315 there are no longer differences in \\"info break\\" output for breakpoints and 5316 tracepoints and the \\"commands\\" command can be used for both tracepoints and 5317 regular breakpoints. 5318 5319 * New targets 5320 5321 ARM Symbian arm*-*-symbianelf* 5322 5323 * D language support. 5324 GDB now supports debugging programs written in the D programming 5325 language. 5326 5327 * GDB now supports the extended ptrace interface for PowerPC which is 5328 available since Linux kernel version 2.6.34. This automatically enables 5329 any hardware breakpoints and additional hardware watchpoints available in 5330 the processor. The old ptrace interface exposes just one hardware 5331 watchpoint and no hardware breakpoints. 5332 5333 * GDB is now able to use the Data Value Compare (DVC) register available on 5334 embedded PowerPC processors to implement in hardware simple watchpoint 5335 conditions of the form: 5336 5337 watch ADDRESS|VARIABLE if ADDRESS|VARIABLE == CONSTANT EXPRESSION 5338 5339 This works in native GDB running on Linux kernels with the extended ptrace 5340 interface mentioned above. 5341 5342 *** Changes in GDB 7.1 5343 5344 * C++ Improvements 5345 5346 ** Namespace Support 5347 5348 GDB now supports importing of namespaces in C++. This enables the 5349 user to inspect variables from imported namespaces. Support for 5350 namepace aliasing has also been added. So, if a namespace is 5351 aliased in the current scope (e.g. namepace C=A; ) the user can 5352 print variables using the alias (e.g. (gdb) print C::x). 5353 5354 ** Bug Fixes 5355 5356 All known bugs relating to the printing of virtual base class were 5357 fixed. It is now possible to call overloaded static methods using a 5358 qualified name. 5359 5360 ** Cast Operators 5361 5362 The C++ cast operators static_cast<>, dynamic_cast<>, const_cast<>, 5363 and reinterpret_cast<> are now handled by the C++ expression parser. 5364 5365 * New targets 5366 5367 Xilinx MicroBlaze microblaze-*-* 5368 Renesas RX rx-*-elf 5369 5370 * New Simulators 5371 5372 Xilinx MicroBlaze microblaze 5373 Renesas RX rx 5374 5375 * Multi-program debugging. 5376 5377 GDB now has support for multi-program (a.k.a. multi-executable or 5378 multi-exec) debugging. This allows for debugging multiple inferiors 5379 simultaneously each running a different program under the same GDB 5380 session. See \\"Debugging Multiple Inferiors and Programs\\" in the 5381 manual for more information. This implied some user visible changes 5382 in the multi-inferior support. For example, \\"info inferiors\\" now 5383 lists inferiors that are not running yet or that have exited 5384 already. See also \\"New commands\\" and \\"New options\\" below. 5385 5386 * New tracing features 5387 5388 GDB's tracepoint facility now includes several new features: 5389 5390 ** Trace state variables 5391 5392 GDB tracepoints now include support for trace state variables, which 5393 are variables managed by the target agent during a tracing 5394 experiment. They are useful for tracepoints that trigger each 5395 other, so for instance one tracepoint can count hits in a variable, 5396 and then a second tracepoint has a condition that is true when the 5397 count reaches a particular value. Trace state variables share the 5398 -syntax of GDB convenience variables, and can appear in both 5399 tracepoint actions and condition expressions. Use the \\"tvariable\\" 5400 command to create, and \\"info tvariables\\" to view; see \\"Trace State 5401 Variables\\" in the manual for more detail. 5402 5403 ** Fast tracepoints 5404 5405 GDB now includes an option for defining fast tracepoints, which 5406 targets may implement more efficiently, such as by installing a jump 5407 into the target agent rather than a trap instruction. The resulting 5408 speedup can be by two orders of magnitude or more, although the 5409 tradeoff is that some program locations on some target architectures 5410 might not allow fast tracepoint installation, for instance if the 5411 instruction to be replaced is shorter than the jump. To request a 5412 fast tracepoint, use the \\"ftrace\\" command, with syntax identical to 5413 the regular trace command. 5414 5415 ** Disconnected tracing 5416 5417 It is now possible to detach GDB from the target while it is running 5418 a trace experiment, then reconnect later to see how the experiment 5419 is going. In addition, a new variable disconnected-tracing lets you 5420 tell the target agent whether to continue running a trace if the 5421 connection is lost unexpectedly. 5422 5423 ** Trace files 5424 5425 GDB now has the ability to save the trace buffer into a file, and 5426 then use that file as a target, similarly to you can do with 5427 corefiles. You can select trace frames, print data that was 5428 collected in them, and use tstatus to display the state of the 5429 tracing run at the moment that it was saved. To create a trace 5430 file, use \\"tsave <filename>\\", and to use it, do \\"target tfile 5431 <name>\\". 5432 5433 ** Circular trace buffer 5434 5435 You can ask the target agent to handle the trace buffer as a 5436 circular buffer, discarding the oldest trace frames to make room for 5437 newer ones, by setting circular-trace-buffer to on. This feature may 5438 not be available for all target agents. 5439 5440 * Changed commands 5441 5442 disassemble 5443 The disassemble command, when invoked with two arguments, now requires 5444 the arguments to be comma-separated. 5445 5446 info variables 5447 The info variables command now displays variable definitions. Files 5448 which only declare a variable are not shown. 5449 5450 source 5451 The source command is now capable of sourcing Python scripts. 5452 This feature is dependent on the debugger being build with Python 5453 support. 5454 5455 Related to this enhancement is also the introduction of a new command 5456 \\"set script-extension\\" (see below). 5457 5458 * New commands (for set/show, see \\"New options\\" below) 5459 5460 record save [<FILENAME>] 5461 Save a file (in core file format) containing the process record 5462 execution log for replay debugging at a later time. 5463 5464 record restore <FILENAME> 5465 Restore the process record execution log that was saved at an 5466 earlier time, for replay debugging. 5467 5468 add-inferior [-copies <N>] [-exec <FILENAME>] 5469 Add a new inferior. 5470 5471 clone-inferior [-copies <N>] [ID] 5472 Make a new inferior ready to execute the same program another 5473 inferior has loaded. 5474 5475 remove-inferior ID 5476 Remove an inferior. 5477 5478 maint info program-spaces 5479 List the program spaces loaded into GDB. 5480 5481 set remote interrupt-sequence [Ctrl-C | BREAK | BREAK-g] 5482 show remote interrupt-sequence 5483 Allow the user to select one of ^C, a BREAK signal or BREAK-g 5484 as the sequence to the remote target in order to interrupt the execution. 5485 Ctrl-C is a default. Some system prefers BREAK which is high level of 5486 serial line for some certain time. Linux kernel prefers BREAK-g, a.k.a 5487 Magic SysRq g. It is BREAK signal and character 'g'. 5488 5489 set remote interrupt-on-connect [on | off] 5490 show remote interrupt-on-connect 5491 When interrupt-on-connect is ON, gdb sends interrupt-sequence to 5492 remote target when gdb connects to it. This is needed when you debug 5493 Linux kernel. 5494 5495 set remotebreak [on | off] 5496 show remotebreak 5497 Deprecated. Use \\"set/show remote interrupt-sequence\\" instead. 5498 5499 tvariable NAME [ = EXP ] 5500 Create or modify a trace state variable. 5501 5502 info tvariables 5503 List trace state variables and their values. 5504 5505 delete tvariable NAME ... 5506 Delete one or more trace state variables. 5507 5508 teval EXPR, ... 5509 Evaluate the given expressions without collecting anything into the 5510 trace buffer. (Valid in tracepoint actions only.) 5511 5512 ftrace FN / FILE:LINE / *ADDR 5513 Define a fast tracepoint at the given function, line, or address. 5514 5515 * New expression syntax 5516 5517 GDB now parses the 0b prefix of binary numbers the same way as GCC does. 5518 GDB now parses 0b101010 identically with 42. 5519 5520 * New options 5521 5522 set follow-exec-mode new|same 5523 show follow-exec-mode 5524 Control whether GDB reuses the same inferior across an exec call or 5525 creates a new one. This is useful to be able to restart the old 5526 executable after the inferior having done an exec call. 5527 5528 set default-collect EXPR, ... 5529 show default-collect 5530 Define a list of expressions to be collected at each tracepoint. 5531 This is a useful way to ensure essential items are not overlooked, 5532 such as registers or a critical global variable. 5533 5534 set disconnected-tracing 5535 show disconnected-tracing 5536 If set to 1, the target is instructed to continue tracing if it 5537 loses its connection to GDB. If 0, the target is to stop tracing 5538 upon disconnection. 5539 5540 set circular-trace-buffer 5541 show circular-trace-buffer 5542 If set to on, the target is instructed to use a circular trace buffer 5543 and discard the oldest trace frames instead of stopping the trace due 5544 to a full trace buffer. If set to off, the trace stops when the buffer 5545 fills up. Some targets may not support this. 5546 5547 set script-extension off|soft|strict 5548 show script-extension 5549 If set to \\"off\\", the debugger does not perform any script language 5550 recognition, and all sourced files are assumed to be GDB scripts. 5551 If set to \\"soft\\" (the default), files are sourced according to 5552 filename extension, falling back to GDB scripts if the first 5553 evaluation failed. 5554 If set to \\"strict\\", files are sourced according to filename extension. 5555 5556 set ada trust-PAD-over-XVS on|off 5557 show ada trust-PAD-over-XVS 5558 If off, activate a workaround against a bug in the debugging information 5559 generated by the compiler for PAD types (see gcc/exp_dbug.ads in 5560 the GCC sources for more information about the GNAT encoding and 5561 PAD types in particular). It is always safe to set this option to 5562 off, but this introduces a slight performance penalty. The default 5563 is on. 5564 5565 * Python API Improvements 5566 5567 ** GDB provides the new class gdb.LazyString. This is useful in 5568 some pretty-printing cases. The new method gdb.Value.lazy_string 5569 provides a simple way to create objects of this type. 5570 5571 ** The fields returned by gdb.Type.fields now have an 5572 \`is_base_class' attribute. 5573 5574 ** The new method gdb.Type.range returns the range of an array type. 5575 5576 ** The new method gdb.parse_and_eval can be used to parse and 5577 evaluate an expression. 5578 5579 * New remote packets 5580 5581 QTDV 5582 Define a trace state variable. 5583 5584 qTV 5585 Get the current value of a trace state variable. 5586 5587 QTDisconnected 5588 Set desired tracing behavior upon disconnection. 5589 5590 QTBuffer:circular 5591 Set the trace buffer to be linear or circular. 5592 5593 qTfP, qTsP 5594 Get data about the tracepoints currently in use. 5595 5596 * Bug fixes 5597 5598 Process record now works correctly with hardware watchpoints. 5599 5600 Multiple bug fixes have been made to the mips-irix port, making it 5601 much more reliable. In particular: 5602 - Debugging threaded applications is now possible again. Previously, 5603 GDB would hang while starting the program, or while waiting for 5604 the program to stop at a breakpoint. 5605 - Attaching to a running process no longer hangs. 5606 - An error occurring while loading a core file has been fixed. 5607 - Changing the value of the PC register now works again. This fixes 5608 problems observed when using the \\"jump\\" command, or when calling 5609 a function from GDB, or even when assigning a new value to pc. 5610 - With the \\"finish\\" and \\"return\\" commands, the return value for functions 5611 returning a small array is now correctly printed. 5612 - It is now possible to break on shared library code which gets executed 5613 during a shared library init phase (code executed while executing 5614 their .init section). Previously, the breakpoint would have no effect. 5615 - GDB is now able to backtrace through the signal handler for 5616 non-threaded programs. 5617 5618 PIE (Position Independent Executable) programs debugging is now supported. 5619 This includes debugging execution of PIC (Position Independent Code) shared 5620 libraries although for that, it should be possible to run such libraries as an 5621 executable program. 5622 5623 *** Changes in GDB 7.0 5624 5625 * GDB now has an interface for JIT compilation. Applications that 5626 dynamically generate code can create symbol files in memory and register 5627 them with GDB. For users, the feature should work transparently, and 5628 for JIT developers, the interface is documented in the GDB manual in the 5629 \\"JIT Compilation Interface\\" chapter. 5630 5631 * Tracepoints may now be conditional. The syntax is as for 5632 breakpoints; either an \\"if\\" clause appended to the \\"trace\\" command, 5633 or the \\"condition\\" command is available. GDB sends the condition to 5634 the target for evaluation using the same bytecode format as is used 5635 for tracepoint actions. 5636 5637 * The disassemble command now supports: an optional /r modifier, print the 5638 raw instructions in hex as well as in symbolic form, and an optional /m 5639 modifier to print mixed source+assembly. 5640 5641 * Process record and replay 5642 5643 In a architecture environment that supports \`\`process record and 5644 replay'', \`\`process record and replay'' target can record a log of 5645 the process execution, and replay it with both forward and reverse 5646 execute commands. 5647 5648 * Reverse debugging: GDB now has new commands reverse-continue, reverse- 5649 step, reverse-next, reverse-finish, reverse-stepi, reverse-nexti, and 5650 set execution-direction {forward|reverse}, for targets that support 5651 reverse execution. 5652 5653 * GDB now supports hardware watchpoints on MIPS/Linux systems. This 5654 feature is available with a native GDB running on kernel version 5655 2.6.28 or later. 5656 5657 * GDB now has support for multi-byte and wide character sets on the 5658 target. Strings whose character type is wchar_t, char16_t, or 5659 char32_t are now correctly printed. GDB supports wide- and unicode- 5660 literals in C, that is, L'x', L\\"string\\", u'x', u\\"string\\", U'x', and 5661 U\\"string\\" syntax. And, GDB allows the \\"%ls\\" and \\"%lc\\" formats in 5662 \`printf'. This feature requires iconv to work properly; if your 5663 system does not have a working iconv, GDB can use GNU libiconv. See 5664 the installation instructions for more information. 5665 5666 * GDB now supports automatic retrieval of shared library files from 5667 remote targets. To use this feature, specify a system root that begins 5668 with the \`remote:' prefix, either via the \`set sysroot' command or via 5669 the \`--with-sysroot' configure-time option. 5670 5671 * \\"info sharedlibrary\\" now takes an optional regex of libraries to show, 5672 and it now reports if a shared library has no debugging information. 5673 5674 * Commands \`set debug-file-directory', \`set solib-search-path' and \`set args' 5675 now complete on file names. 5676 5677 * When completing in expressions, gdb will attempt to limit 5678 completions to allowable structure or union fields, where appropriate. 5679 For instance, consider: 5680 5681 # struct example { int f1; double f2; }; 5682 # struct example variable; 5683 (gdb) p variable. 5684 5685 If the user types TAB at the end of this command line, the available 5686 completions will be \\"f1\\" and \\"f2\\". 5687 5688 * Inlined functions are now supported. They show up in backtraces, and 5689 the \\"step\\", \\"next\\", and \\"finish\\" commands handle them automatically. 5690 5691 * GDB now supports the token-splicing () and stringification (#) 5692 operators when expanding macros. It also supports variable-arity 5693 macros. 5694 5695 * GDB now supports inspecting extra signal information, exported by 5696 the new _siginfo convenience variable. The feature is currently 5697 implemented on linux ARM, i386 and amd64. 5698 5699 * GDB can now display the VFP floating point registers and NEON vector 5700 registers on ARM targets. Both ARM GNU/Linux native GDB and gdbserver 5701 can provide these registers (requires Linux 2.6.30 or later). Remote 5702 and simulator targets may also provide them. 5703 5704 * New remote packets 5705 5706 qSearch:memory: 5707 Search memory for a sequence of bytes. 5708 5709 QStartNoAckMode 5710 Turn off \`+'/\`-' protocol acknowledgments to permit more efficient 5711 operation over reliable transport links. Use of this packet is 5712 controlled by the \`set remote noack-packet' command. 5713 5714 vKill 5715 Kill the process with the specified process ID. Use this in preference 5716 to \`k' when multiprocess protocol extensions are supported. 5717 5718 qXfer:osdata:read 5719 Obtains additional operating system information 5720 5721 qXfer:siginfo:read 5722 qXfer:siginfo:write 5723 Read or write additional signal information. 5724 5725 * Removed remote protocol undocumented extension 5726 5727 An undocumented extension to the remote protocol's \`S' stop reply 5728 packet that permitted the stub to pass a process id was removed. 5729 Remote servers should use the \`T' stop reply packet instead. 5730 5731 * GDB now supports multiple function calling conventions according to the 5732 DWARF-2 DW_AT_calling_convention function attribute. 5733 5734 * The SH target utilizes the aforementioned change to distinguish between gcc 5735 and Renesas calling convention. It also adds the new CLI commands 5736 \`set/show sh calling-convention'. 5737 5738 * GDB can now read compressed debug sections, as produced by GNU gold 5739 with the --compress-debug-sections=zlib flag. 5740 5741 * 64-bit core files are now supported on AIX. 5742 5743 * Thread switching is now supported on Tru64. 5744 5745 * Watchpoints can now be set on unreadable memory locations, e.g. addresses 5746 which will be allocated using malloc later in program execution. 5747 5748 * The qXfer:libraries:read remote protocol packet now allows passing a 5749 list of section offsets. 5750 5751 * On GNU/Linux, GDB can now attach to stopped processes. Several race 5752 conditions handling signals delivered during attach or thread creation 5753 have also been fixed. 5754 5755 * GDB now supports the use of DWARF boolean types for Ada's type Boolean. 5756 From the user's standpoint, all unqualified instances of True and False 5757 are treated as the standard definitions, regardless of context. 5758 5759 * GDB now parses C++ symbol and type names more flexibly. For 5760 example, given: 5761 5762 template<typename T> class C { }; 5763 C<char const *> c; 5764 5765 GDB will now correctly handle all of: 5766 5767 ptype C<char const *> 5768 ptype C<char const*> 5769 ptype C<const char *> 5770 ptype C<const char*> 5771 5772 * New features in the GDB remote stub, gdbserver 5773 5774 - The \\"--wrapper\\" command-line argument tells gdbserver to use a 5775 wrapper program to launch programs for debugging. 5776 5777 - On PowerPC and S/390 targets, it is now possible to use a single 5778 gdbserver executable to debug both 32-bit and 64-bit programs. 5779 (This requires gdbserver itself to be built as a 64-bit executable.) 5780 5781 - gdbserver uses the new noack protocol mode for TCP connections to 5782 reduce communications latency, if also supported and enabled in GDB. 5783 5784 - Support for the sparc64-linux-gnu target is now included in 5785 gdbserver. 5786 5787 - The amd64-linux build of gdbserver now supports debugging both 5788 32-bit and 64-bit programs. 5789 5790 - The i386-linux, amd64-linux, and i386-win32 builds of gdbserver 5791 now support hardware watchpoints, and will use them automatically 5792 as appropriate. 5793 5794 * Python scripting 5795 5796 GDB now has support for scripting using Python. Whether this is 5797 available is determined at configure time. 5798 5799 New GDB commands can now be written in Python. 5800 5801 * Ada tasking support 5802 5803 Ada tasks can now be inspected in GDB. The following commands have 5804 been introduced: 5805 5806 info tasks 5807 Print the list of Ada tasks. 5808 info task N 5809 Print detailed information about task number N. 5810 task 5811 Print the task number of the current task. 5812 task N 5813 Switch the context of debugging to task number N. 5814 5815 * Support for user-defined prefixed commands. The \\"define\\" command can 5816 add new commands to existing prefixes, e.g. \\"target\\". 5817 5818 * Multi-inferior, multi-process debugging. 5819 5820 GDB now has generalized support for multi-inferior debugging. See 5821 \\"Debugging Multiple Inferiors\\" in the manual for more information. 5822 Although availability still depends on target support, the command 5823 set is more uniform now. The GNU/Linux specific multi-forks support 5824 has been migrated to this new framework. This implied some user 5825 visible changes; see \\"New commands\\" and also \\"Removed commands\\" 5826 below. 5827 5828 * Target descriptions can now describe the target OS ABI. See the 5829 \\"Target Description Format\\" section in the user manual for more 5830 information. 5831 5832 * Target descriptions can now describe \\"compatible\\" architectures 5833 to indicate that the target can execute applications for a different 5834 architecture in addition to those for the main target architecture. 5835 See the \\"Target Description Format\\" section in the user manual for 5836 more information. 5837 5838 * Multi-architecture debugging. 5839 5840 GDB now includes general supports for debugging applications on 5841 hybrid systems that use more than one single processor architecture 5842 at the same time. Each such hybrid architecture still requires 5843 specific support to be added. The only hybrid architecture supported 5844 in this version of GDB is the Cell Broadband Engine. 5845 5846 * GDB now supports integrated debugging of Cell/B.E. applications that 5847 use both the PPU and SPU architectures. To enable support for hybrid 5848 Cell/B.E. debugging, you need to configure GDB to support both the 5849 powerpc-linux or powerpc64-linux and the spu-elf targets, using the 5850 --enable-targets configure option. 5851 5852 * Non-stop mode debugging. 5853 5854 For some targets, GDB now supports an optional mode of operation in 5855 which you can examine stopped threads while other threads continue 5856 to execute freely. This is referred to as non-stop mode, with the 5857 old mode referred to as all-stop mode. See the \\"Non-Stop Mode\\" 5858 section in the user manual for more information. 5859 5860 To be able to support remote non-stop debugging, a remote stub needs 5861 to implement the non-stop mode remote protocol extensions, as 5862 described in the \\"Remote Non-Stop\\" section of the user manual. The 5863 GDB remote stub, gdbserver, has been adjusted to support these 5864 extensions on linux targets. 5865 5866 * New commands (for set/show, see \\"New options\\" below) 5867 5868 catch syscall [NAME(S) | NUMBER(S)] 5869 Catch system calls. Arguments, which should be names of system 5870 calls or their numbers, mean catch only those syscalls. Without 5871 arguments, every syscall will be caught. When the inferior issues 5872 any of the specified syscalls, GDB will stop and announce the system 5873 call, both when it is called and when its call returns. This 5874 feature is currently available with a native GDB running on the 5875 Linux Kernel, under the following architectures: x86, x86_64, 5876 PowerPC and PowerPC64. 5877 5878 find [/size-char] [/max-count] start-address, end-address|+search-space-size, 5879 val1 [, val2, ...] 5880 Search memory for a sequence of bytes. 5881 5882 maint set python print-stack 5883 maint show python print-stack 5884 Show a stack trace when an error is encountered in a Python script. 5885 5886 python [CODE] 5887 Invoke CODE by passing it to the Python interpreter. 5888 5889 macro define 5890 macro list 5891 macro undef 5892 These allow macros to be defined, undefined, and listed 5893 interactively. 5894 5895 info os processes 5896 Show operating system information about processes. 5897 5898 info inferiors 5899 List the inferiors currently under GDB's control. 5900 5901 inferior NUM 5902 Switch focus to inferior number NUM. 5903 5904 detach inferior NUM 5905 Detach from inferior number NUM. 5906 5907 kill inferior NUM 5908 Kill inferior number NUM. 5909 5910 * New options 5911 5912 set spu stop-on-load 5913 show spu stop-on-load 5914 Control whether to stop for new SPE threads during Cell/B.E. debugging. 5915 5916 set spu auto-flush-cache 5917 show spu auto-flush-cache 5918 Control whether to automatically flush the software-managed cache 5919 during Cell/B.E. debugging. 5920 5921 set sh calling-convention 5922 show sh calling-convention 5923 Control the calling convention used when calling SH target functions. 5924 5925 set debug timestamp 5926 show debug timestamp 5927 Control display of timestamps with GDB debugging output. 5928 5929 set disassemble-next-line 5930 show disassemble-next-line 5931 Control display of disassembled source lines or instructions when 5932 the debuggee stops. 5933 5934 set remote noack-packet 5935 show remote noack-packet 5936 Set/show the use of remote protocol QStartNoAckMode packet. See above 5937 under \\"New remote packets.\\" 5938 5939 set remote query-attached-packet 5940 show remote query-attached-packet 5941 Control use of remote protocol \`qAttached' (query-attached) packet. 5942 5943 set remote read-siginfo-object 5944 show remote read-siginfo-object 5945 Control use of remote protocol \`qXfer:siginfo:read' (read-siginfo-object) 5946 packet. 5947 5948 set remote write-siginfo-object 5949 show remote write-siginfo-object 5950 Control use of remote protocol \`qXfer:siginfo:write' (write-siginfo-object) 5951 packet. 5952 5953 set remote reverse-continue 5954 show remote reverse-continue 5955 Control use of remote protocol 'bc' (reverse-continue) packet. 5956 5957 set remote reverse-step 5958 show remote reverse-step 5959 Control use of remote protocol 'bs' (reverse-step) packet. 5960 5961 set displaced-stepping 5962 show displaced-stepping 5963 Control displaced stepping mode. Displaced stepping is a way to 5964 single-step over breakpoints without removing them from the debuggee. 5965 Also known as \\"out-of-line single-stepping\\". 5966 5967 set debug displaced 5968 show debug displaced 5969 Control display of debugging info for displaced stepping. 5970 5971 maint set internal-error 5972 maint show internal-error 5973 Control what GDB does when an internal error is detected. 5974 5975 maint set internal-warning 5976 maint show internal-warning 5977 Control what GDB does when an internal warning is detected. 5978 5979 set exec-wrapper 5980 show exec-wrapper 5981 unset exec-wrapper 5982 Use a wrapper program to launch programs for debugging. 5983 5984 set multiple-symbols (all|ask|cancel) 5985 show multiple-symbols 5986 The value of this variable can be changed to adjust the debugger behavior 5987 when an expression or a breakpoint location contains an ambiguous symbol 5988 name (an overloaded function name, for instance). 5989 5990 set breakpoint always-inserted 5991 show breakpoint always-inserted 5992 Keep breakpoints always inserted in the target, as opposed to inserting 5993 them when resuming the target, and removing them when the target stops. 5994 This option can improve debugger performance on slow remote targets. 5995 5996 set arm fallback-mode (arm|thumb|auto) 5997 show arm fallback-mode 5998 set arm force-mode (arm|thumb|auto) 5999 show arm force-mode 6000 These commands control how ARM GDB determines whether instructions 6001 are ARM or Thumb. The default for both settings is auto, which uses 6002 the current CPSR value for instructions without symbols; previous 6003 versions of GDB behaved as if \\"set arm fallback-mode arm\\". 6004 6005 set arm unwind-secure-frames 6006 Enable unwinding from Non-secure to Secure mode on Cortex-M with 6007 Security extension. 6008 This can trigger security exceptions when unwinding exception stacks. 6009 6010 set disable-randomization 6011 show disable-randomization 6012 Standalone programs run with the virtual address space randomization enabled 6013 by default on some platforms. This option keeps the addresses stable across 6014 multiple debugging sessions. 6015 6016 set non-stop 6017 show non-stop 6018 Control whether other threads are stopped or not when some thread hits 6019 a breakpoint. 6020 6021 set target-async 6022 show target-async 6023 Requests that asynchronous execution is enabled in the target, if available. 6024 In this case, it's possible to resume target in the background, and interact 6025 with GDB while the target is running. \\"show target-async\\" displays the 6026 current state of asynchronous execution of the target. 6027 6028 set target-wide-charset 6029 show target-wide-charset 6030 The target-wide-charset is the name of the character set that GDB 6031 uses when printing characters whose type is wchar_t. 6032 6033 set tcp auto-retry (on|off) 6034 show tcp auto-retry 6035 set tcp connect-timeout 6036 show tcp connect-timeout 6037 These commands allow GDB to retry failed TCP connections to a remote stub 6038 with a specified timeout period; this is useful if the stub is launched 6039 in parallel with GDB but may not be ready to accept connections immediately. 6040 6041 set libthread-db-search-path 6042 show libthread-db-search-path 6043 Control list of directories which GDB will search for appropriate 6044 libthread_db. 6045 6046 set schedule-multiple (on|off) 6047 show schedule-multiple 6048 Allow GDB to resume all threads of all processes or only threads of 6049 the current process. 6050 6051 set stack-cache 6052 show stack-cache 6053 Use more aggressive caching for accesses to the stack. This improves 6054 performance of remote debugging (particularly backtraces) without 6055 affecting correctness. 6056 6057 set interactive-mode (on|off|auto) 6058 show interactive-mode 6059 Control whether GDB runs in interactive mode (on) or not (off). 6060 When in interactive mode, GDB waits for the user to answer all 6061 queries. Otherwise, GDB does not wait and assumes the default 6062 answer. When set to auto (the default), GDB determines which 6063 mode to use based on the stdin settings. 6064 6065 * Removed commands 6066 6067 info forks 6068 For program forks, this is replaced by the new more generic \`info 6069 inferiors' command. To list checkpoints, you can still use the 6070 \`info checkpoints' command, which was an alias for the \`info forks' 6071 command. 6072 6073 fork NUM 6074 Replaced by the new \`inferior' command. To switch between 6075 checkpoints, you can still use the \`restart' command, which was an 6076 alias for the \`fork' command. 6077 6078 process PID 6079 This is removed, since some targets don't have a notion of 6080 processes. To switch between processes, you can still use the 6081 \`inferior' command using GDB's own inferior number. 6082 6083 delete fork NUM 6084 For program forks, this is replaced by the new more generic \`kill 6085 inferior' command. To delete a checkpoint, you can still use the 6086 \`delete checkpoint' command, which was an alias for the \`delete 6087 fork' command. 6088 6089 detach fork NUM 6090 For program forks, this is replaced by the new more generic \`detach 6091 inferior' command. To detach a checkpoint, you can still use the 6092 \`detach checkpoint' command, which was an alias for the \`detach 6093 fork' command. 6094 6095 * New native configurations 6096 6097 x86/x86_64 Darwin i[34567]86-*-darwin* 6098 6099 x86_64 MinGW x86_64-*-mingw* 6100 6101 * New targets 6102 6103 Lattice Mico32 lm32-* 6104 x86 DICOS i[34567]86-*-dicos* 6105 x86_64 DICOS x86_64-*-dicos* 6106 S+core 3 score-*-* 6107 6108 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports x86 Windows CE 6109 (mingw32ce) debugging. 6110 6111 * Removed commands 6112 6113 catch load 6114 catch unload 6115 These commands were actually not implemented on any target. 6116 6117 *** Changes in GDB 6.8 6118 6119 * New native configurations 6120 6121 NetBSD/hppa hppa*-*netbsd* 6122 Xtensa GNU/Linux xtensa*-*-linux* 6123 6124 * New targets 6125 6126 NetBSD/hppa hppa*-*-netbsd* 6127 Xtensa GNU/Linux xtensa*-*-linux* 6128 6129 * Change in command line behavior -- corefiles vs. process ids. 6130 6131 When the '-p NUMBER' or '--pid NUMBER' options are used, and 6132 attaching to process NUMBER fails, GDB no longer attempts to open a 6133 core file named NUMBER. Attaching to a program using the -c option 6134 is no longer supported. Instead, use the '-p' or '--pid' options. 6135 6136 * GDB can now be built as a native debugger for debugging Windows x86 6137 (mingw32) Portable Executable (PE) programs. 6138 6139 * Pending breakpoints no longer change their number when their address 6140 is resolved. 6141 6142 * GDB now supports breakpoints with multiple locations, 6143 including breakpoints on C++ constructors, inside C++ templates, 6144 and in inlined functions. 6145 6146 * GDB's ability to debug optimized code has been improved. GDB more 6147 accurately identifies function bodies and lexical blocks that occupy 6148 more than one contiguous range of addresses. 6149 6150 * Target descriptions can now describe registers for PowerPC. 6151 6152 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports the AltiVec and SPE 6153 registers on PowerPC targets. 6154 6155 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports thread debugging on GNU/Linux 6156 targets even when the libthread_db library is not available. 6157 6158 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports the new file transfer 6159 commands (remote put, remote get, and remote delete). 6160 6161 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports run and attach in 6162 extended-remote mode. 6163 6164 * hppa*64*-*-hpux11* target broken 6165 The debugger is unable to start a program and fails with the following 6166 error: \\"Error trying to get information about dynamic linker\\". 6167 The gdb-6.7 release is also affected. 6168 6169 * GDB now supports the --enable-targets= configure option to allow 6170 building a single GDB executable that supports multiple remote 6171 target architectures. 6172 6173 * GDB now supports debugging C and C++ programs which use the 6174 Decimal Floating Point extension. In addition, the PowerPC target 6175 now has a set of pseudo-registers to inspect decimal float values 6176 stored in two consecutive float registers. 6177 6178 * The -break-insert MI command can optionally create pending 6179 breakpoints now. 6180 6181 * Improved support for debugging Ada 6182 Many improvements to the Ada language support have been made.

(http://scan.coverity.com). 6235 6236 * When looking up multiply-defined global symbols, GDB will now prefer the 6237 symbol definition in the current shared library if it was built using the 6238 -Bsymbolic linker option. 6239 6240 * When the Text User Interface (TUI) is not configured, GDB will now 6241 recognize the -tui command-line option and print a message that the TUI 6242 is not supported. 6243 6244 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now has lower overhead for high 6245 frequency signals (e.g. SIGALRM) via the QPassSignals packet. 6246 6247 * GDB for MIPS targets now autodetects whether a remote target provides 6248 32-bit or 64-bit register values. 6249 6250 * Support for C++ member pointers has been improved. 6251 6252 * GDB now understands XML target descriptions, which specify the 6253 target's overall architecture. GDB can read a description from 6254 a local file or over the remote serial protocol. 6255 6256 * Vectors of single-byte data use a new integer type which is not 6257 automatically displayed as character or string data. 6258 6259 * The /s format now works with the print command. It displays 6260 arrays of single-byte integers and pointers to single-byte integers 6261 as strings. 6262 6263 * Target descriptions can now describe target-specific registers, 6264 for architectures which have implemented the support (currently 6265 only ARM, M68K, and MIPS). 6266 6267 * GDB and the GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now support the XScale 6268 iWMMXt coprocessor. 6269 6270 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, has been updated to support 6271 ARM Windows CE (mingw32ce) debugging, and GDB Windows CE support 6272 has been rewritten to use the standard GDB remote protocol. 6273 6274 * GDB can now step into C++ functions which are called through thunks. 6275 6276 * GDB for the Cell/B.E. SPU now supports overlay debugging. 6277 6278 * The GDB remote protocol \\"qOffsets\\" packet can now honor ELF segment 6279 layout. It also supports a TextSeg= and DataSeg= response when only 6280 segment base addresses (rather than offsets) are available. 6281 6282 * The /i format now outputs any trailing branch delay slot instructions 6283 immediately following the last instruction within the count specified. 6284 6285 * The GDB remote protocol \\"T\\" stop reply packet now supports a 6286 \\"library\\" response. Combined with the new \\"qXfer:libraries:read\\" 6287 packet, this response allows GDB to debug shared libraries on targets 6288 where the operating system manages the list of loaded libraries (e.g. 6289 Windows and SymbianOS). 6290 6291 * The GDB remote stub, gdbserver, now supports dynamic link libraries 6292 (DLLs) on Windows and Windows CE targets. 6293 6294 * GDB now supports a faster verification that a .debug file matches its binary 6295 according to its build-id signature, if the signature is present. 6296 6297 * New commands 6298 6299 set remoteflow 6300 show remoteflow 6301 Enable or disable hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) on the serial port 6302 when debugging using remote targets. 6303 6304 set mem inaccessible-by-default 6305 show mem inaccessible-by-default 6306 If the target supplies a memory map, for instance via the remote 6307 protocol's \\"qXfer:memory-map:read\\" packet, setting this variable 6308 prevents GDB from accessing memory outside the memory map. This 6309 is useful for targets with memory mapped registers or which react 6310 badly to accesses of unmapped address space. 6311 6312 set breakpoint auto-hw 6313 show breakpoint auto-hw 6314 If the target supplies a memory map, for instance via the remote 6315 protocol's \\"qXfer:memory-map:read\\" packet, setting this variable 6316 lets GDB use hardware breakpoints automatically for memory regions 6317 where it can not use software breakpoints. This covers both the 6318 \\"break\\" command and internal breakpoints used for other commands 6319 including \\"next\\" and \\"finish\\". 6320 6321 catch exception 6322 catch exception unhandled 6323 Stop the program execution when Ada exceptions are raised. 6324 6325 catch assert 6326 Stop the program execution when an Ada assertion failed. 6327 6328 set sysroot 6329 show sysroot 6330 Set an alternate system root for target files. This is a more 6331 general version of \\"set solib-absolute-prefix\\", which is now 6332 an alias to \\"set sysroot\\". 6333 6334 info spu 6335 Provide extended SPU facility status information.

À 21 ans, elle incarnait la perfection aux yeux de ses parents, des notables rigides et traditionnels. Ils avaient choisi de peindre sa vie comme on orne minutieusement une toile classique, où chaque coup de pinceau est réfléchi et chaque couleur sélectionnée avec la plus grande précaution. Leur œuvre la plus récente était l'arrangement matrimonial avec Alain, un jeune homme au port altier et à la mâchoire carrée. Un parti idéal selon les standards paternels, mais un parfait inconnu aux yeux de Clarisse. Elle avait été fiancée à lui dès ses 18 ans, et tous les détails furent méticuleusement organisés pour que le mariage se déroule sans accroc. Le jour tant vanté par ses géniteurs se leva enfin, solaire et chargé de promesses. Mais la véritable Clarisse, celle qui s'était complaisamment pliée à toutes leurs exigences sans jamais émettre la moindre résistance, choisit ce jour pour faire éclater sa révolte. Elle n'avait jamais aimé Alain, elle n'avait jamais voulu de cette vie toute tracée. Alors qu'elle était parée d'une robe blanche étincelant d'espoir et de pureté, elle prit la décision la plus impulsive et la plus libératrice de sa vie. Sans avertir quiconque, Clarisse s'échappa par une porte dérobée et parcourut les rues pavées de la ville, guidée par un seul désir : anéantir le tableau que ses parents avaient si méticuleusement peint. Au détour d'une ruelle, elle croisa le chemin d'Yvonne, une femme à la gouaille bien trempée et à l'allure débraillée, âgée de 61 ans. Yvonne incarnait tout ce que ses parents méprisaient : une existence sans finesse, une vie jouée cartes sur table, une personne qui avait mordu dans la pomme de la vie jusqu'à en révéler le cœur amer. Elle était insolente, grossière et sans le moindre sou en poche. Clarisse, dans un élan d'audace qui l'étonna elle-même, proposa à Yvonne une somme d’argent pour se marier avec elle, sans plus de cérémonies, devant le premier officier d'état civil qu'elles trouveraient. Yvonne éclata d'un rire rauque et accepta le marché, flairant l’aubaine. L'union fut consommée dans la plus simple des apparences, loin de la majesté du mariage qui aurait dû avoir lieu. Lorsque ceux qui l'avaient jusqu'alors tenue sous leur coupe découvrirent l'escapade et le choix du cœur – ou plutôt de la rébellion – de Clarisse, une tempête émotionnelle s'abattit sur la famille. En un éclair de colère et une profonde déception, ils lui coupèrent subitement les vivres. Déshéritée et ostracisée, Clarisse vit son monde se désagréger. Le poids de ses choix semblait l'écraser, et pourtant, elle sentit en elle une résilience naissante. Yvonne, avec son franc-parler et son indomptable indépendance, commença étrangement à l’intriguer, à la fasciner même. Au fil des jours passés dans l’humilité d'un petit appartement que la précarité rendait chaleureux, les commentaires grossiers d'Yvonne se muèrent peu à peu en des mots d'une surprenante tendresse. Clarisse découvrit une attention, une bienveillance qui ne demandait rien en retour, une affection brute et sans artifice. L'amour, ce sentiment qu'elle croyait comprendre à travers les contes et les attentes de ses parents, commença à germer dans son cœur, lentement, imperceptiblement. Un amour authentique, qui ne venait pas d'une fable écrite par d'autres, mais qui naissait des cendres d'une rébellion nécessaire. Yvonne enseigna à Clarisse la force de la vulnérabilité, la beauté des imperfections et la liberté qu'offrait une vie choisie, non pas imposée.

Список \`e\` содержит элементы [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, 6]. 2. Срез \`b = e[1:3]\` будет содержать [2, 2]. 3. Срез \`c = e[-3:-2]\` будет содержать [4]. 4. Переменная \`d\` будет равна результату конкатенации списка \`b\` и списка \`c\`, умноженному на 2, то есть [2, 2, 4, 4]. 5. Переменная \`q\` будет равна копии переменной \`d\`, т.е. [2, 2, 4, 4]. 6. Значение третьего элемента \`q\` изменяется на 5, так что \`q\` становится [2, 2, 5, 4]. 7. Значение второго элемента \`d\` изменяется на 10, так что \`d\` становится [2, 10, 4, 1]. 8. Значение четвертого элемента \`d\` изменяется на 1, так что \`d\` становится [2, 10, 4, 1]. 9. В результате \`print(q[2] - d[0] + d[1])\` мы вычисляем 5 - 2 + 10, что дает нам результат 13.

Поскольку каждый вызов функции вызывает два дополнительных вызова (кроме базовых случаев n <= 1), время выполнения алгоритма увеличивается экспоненциально с увеличением n. Это связано с тем, что дерево рекурсивных вызовов становится очень большим из-за множества ветвей. Таким образом, алгоритм вычисления чисел Фибоначчи через рекурсию является примером алгоритма с экспоненциальной сложностью."},{"prompt":"Оцените временную сложность алгоритма (ответ поясните). a = [...] # введен и заполнен целыми числами n = len(a) m = n for i in range(m): while n > 0: print(a[n]) n = n - 1","completion":"Давайте проанализируем данный код и оценим его временную сложность: 1. Заполение списка \`a\` происходит вне цикла и не зависит от размера списка. Это займет константное время O(1). 2. Вычисляем длину списка \`a\` и сохраняем ее в переменную \`n\`. Это тоже занимает константное время O(1). 3. Инициализация переменной \`m\` также займет константное время O(1). 4. Внешний цикл \`for i in range(m)\` будет выполняться \`m\` раз, где \`m\` равно значению \`n\`. Таким образом, временная сложность внешнего цикла O(n). 5. Внутренний цикл \`while n > 0\` будет выполняться \`n\` раз на каждой итерации внешнего цикла. На первой итерации внешнего цикла он будет выполняться \`n\` раз, на второй - \`n-1\` раз, и так далее. В итоге внутренний цикл выполнится n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 раз, что в сумме равно n*(n+1)/2. Поэтому временная сложность внутреннего цикла O(n^2). 6. Вывод элемента \`a[n]\` занимает константное время O(1). Итак, общая временная сложность данного алгоритма будет O(n^2), так как внешний цикл имеет O(n) и внутренний цикл имеет O(n^2), что будет определять скорость выполнения алгоритма при увеличении входных данных."},{"prompt":"extract all the mp4 links in this html using plain javascript.

the corresponding Jinja2 template code for a web page related to managing scores in a fencing competition. To clearly separate the concerns and provide guidance, let's review your back-end and front-end code: **Backend (Flask and Python):** The Python code you provided is from a Flask route definition. Here are several observations and suggestions: 1. The \`gestion_score\` function is responsible for preparing data related to the competition's pool phase, which is then passed to a Jinja2 template. It includes fetching information like the list of fencers and their clubs, the assigned track, the referee, and scores for matches. 2. You've put HTML code with an anchor tag inside your Python function, which isn't syntactically correct. If this is part of your template, it should be moved to the template part of the code. 3. When dealing with lists of dictionaries in Flask (\`liste_absents\`), it's essential to make sure they are appropriately handled in your route and use the correct methods to manipulate them. Your current process of constructing \`liste_absents_dico\` has a mistake: instead of \`tireur.append(tireur)\`, it should be \`liste_absents_dico.append(tireur)\`. 4. The route defined as \`@app.route(\\"/gestion_score/<int:id_comp>/<int:id_type_match>/\\")\` does not seem to accept \`POST\` requests, but later you have forms that might use \`POST\` to call this endpoint. Make sure to handle the correct request methods (\`GET\`, \`POST\`) in your route definitions. **Frontend (Jinja2 and HTML):** Your HTML code with Jinja2 template syntax will render the web page for managing participants within a competition. Observations here include: 1. Static file references and route URLs are correctly utilized with Jinja2's \`url_for\` method. 2. You've placed \`script\` tags in your HTML that include some configuration variables from the backend. Check if the values \`{{ nb_participants_blois }}\`, \`{{ nb_participants_other }}\`, and \`{{ participants_arb|length }}\` are correctly provided by the back-end. 3. You are extending a base template and providing the primary content in the \`content\` block, which is the expected use of template inheritance with Jinja2. 4. Your HTML structure shows various sections for managing participants, with \`add\` and \`delete\` capabilities. Review the submission forms to ensure they align with your Flask route handling and verify functionality such as adding or removing participants. 5. To create an active workflow for the user, you've provided a progress bar showing steps in competition management. Each step points to different routes, suggesting a multi-step process. 6. Finally, ensure that your Javascript scripts (\`condCompetValide.js\`, \`gestionParticipant.js\`, and \`editField.js\`) are working as expected and interacting correctly with the DOM elements on your page. While the code segments seem disconnected from each other, as long as each part is correctly integrated into their respective places within a Flask project, your application should function. Remember to test each part of your app and debug any issues separately, depending on whether they belong to the backend logic or the frontend display and interactivity."},{"prompt":"werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'gestion_score' with values ['id_comp']. Did you forget to specify values ['id_type_match']?","completion":"The error message you're seeing is telling you that the URL for the \`gestion_score\` endpoint could not be built because the expected route parameter \`id_type_match\` is missing. When defining the route in Flask, you have: \`\`\`python @app.route(\\"/gestion_score/<int:id_comp>/<int:id_type_match>/\\") def gestion_score(id_comp, id_type_match=1, liste_absents=[]): # Function body... \`\`\` The route expects two parameters: \`id_comp\` and \`id_type_match\`. However, when you're trying to generate a URL for this endpoint, you're only providing the \`id_comp\` value and not \`id_type_match\`. To fix this issue, make sure you provide all the required parameters when using \`url_for\` to build a URL for the \`gestion_score\` endpoint. In the HTML template, the correct usage of \`url_for\` will be: \`\`\`html <a href=\\"{{ url_for('gestion_score', id_comp=competition.idComp, id_type_match=1) }}\\">Gestion score</a> \`\`\` Notice that I've added \`id_type_match=1\` to the \`url_for\` function call, which will now correctly satisfy all the necessary parameters for building the URL. If you want \`id_type_match\` to be optional, you'd have to define another route in Flask without that parameter and handle it accordingly: \`\`\`python @app.route(\\"/gestion_score/<int:id_comp>/\\", defaults={'id_type_match': 1}) @app.route(\\"/gestion_score/<int:id_comp>/<int:id_type_match>/\\") def gestion_score(id_comp, id_type_match): # Function body... \`\`\` Keep in mind that with this

\`update_scores\` route in your Flask application to check for the existence of the match and handle it accordingly. I'll outline a strategy for this using the \`Match\` model you've provided. In this strategy, if the match is not found when trying to update the scores, you'll create a new match and save it to the database: \`\`\`python @app.route('/update_scores', methods=['POST']) def update_scores(): # Existing code to extract data from the request # ... # Check if a match already exists match = get_match(licence, openent_licence, id_poule, id_comp) if match: # Update match scores if match already exists # ... else: # Create a new match if it does not exist new_match = Match( idTypeMatch=id_type_match, numeroLicenceE1=licence, numeroLicenceE2=openent_licence, # Assuming idPoule, dateMatch, heureMatch have appropriate values idPoule=id_poule, dateMatch=date.today(), # or the correct date heureMatch=datetime.now().time(), # or the correct time # Set initial scores, assuming score for licence is given touchesDonneesTireur1=score, touchesRecuesTireur2=score, touchesRecuesTireur1=0, touchesDonneesTireur2=0, ) db.session.add(new_match) # Save idPiste and idArbitre if necessary # Assuming you have these values: # new_match.idPiste = id_piste # new_match.idArbitre = id_arbitre db.session.commit() return jsonify({'success': 'New match created and score saved successfully'}) # ... \`\`\` Note that this is a basic example, and you'll need to ensure that this code correctly fits within your application's existing logic and properly integrates with your database and business rules. Additionally, you should check the validity of the match creation before saving it. This includes verifying participant eligibility, ensuring no scheduling conflicts, and any other conditions pertinent to the integrity of the competition. Properly handling errors and edge cases (such as keeping match history intact and updating relevant standings) is also crucial to avoid corrupting the competition data. Make sure you have the necessary imports at the beginning of your Flask application file: \`\`\`python from datetime import date, datetime from flask import jsonify, request from .app import db from .models import Match, TypeMatch \`\`\` You may also need to retrieve \`id_piste\` and \`id_arbitre\`, along with the \`dateMatch\` and \`heureMatch\`, from the request data or other relevant parts of your application.

appears to be part of a larger Flask application that manages fencing competitions, including participants, scores, and competition phases like pools and elimination rounds. To have different phases for a competition, you need to represent each phase distinctly in your database and application logic. First, let's address the initial question about managing different competition phases. Based on the models you provided, here's an example of how you might extend the database schema to support multiple phases: 1. Define a new \`Phase\` model that will serve as an enumeration of the different competition phases (e.g., Pool, Round of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals). \`\`\`python class Phase(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'PHASE' idPhase = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True) nomPhase = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False) def __init__(self, nom_phase): self.nomPhase = nom_phase \`\`\` 2. Add a table that links a competition to its phases, with additional information like start time, end time, and completion status. For example, a \`CompetitionPhase\` model: \`\`\`python class CompetitionPhase(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'COMPETITION_PHASE' idCompPhase = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True) idComp = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('COMPETITION.idComp'), nullable=False) idPhase = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('PHASE.idPhase'), nullable=False) startTime = db.Column(db.DateTime) endTime = db.Column(db.DateTime) isCompleted = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False) competition = db.relationship('Competition', backref='competition_phases') phase = db.relationship('Phase', backref='competition_phases') def __init__(self, id_comp, id_phase, start_time, end_time, is_completed): self.idComp = id_comp self.idPhase = id_phase self.startTime = start_time self.endTime = end_time self.isCompleted = is_completed \`\`\` With these models in place, you can then add logic in your application to create phases for a competition, advance the competition through its phases, and mark each phase as completed. You'd also need to adjust your application's views, controllers, and templates to handle phases appropriately. When updating scores or advancing the competition, you could check the current phase and ensure the right logic is applied for that particular phase (e.g., assigning matches to pools vs. elimination brackets, determining advancement criteria, etc.). Remember that this is a high-level example and not a comprehensive solution. To implement this, you'd have to integrate the new models and logic with the existing code, create migration files for the database schema changes, ensure foreign keys and relationships are correctly defined, and adjust the rest of your application accordingly. Once these changes are made, you could query the \`CompetitionPhase\` table based on the \`idComp\` to determine the current phase of a competition and render the appropriate view or perform the necessary logic for that phase."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"search-container"},G={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},L={key:1};function O(o,e,l,m,n,r){const p=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",N,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",G,[(i(!0),a(y,null,v(r.displayedPoems,(s,f)=>(i(),k(p,{key:f,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",R,' No results found for "'+c(n.searchQuery)+'".
