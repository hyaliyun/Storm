At the reduced price R (which is Rs. 25), the amount of wheat she can get for Rs. 500 is 500/R kgs. According to the information given, the difference in the amount of wheat she can get at the two prices is 3 kgs. So we can write the equation: 500/R - 500/P = 3 We know R is Rs. 25, so we can substitute that into the equation: 500/25 - 500/P = 3 20 - 500/P = 3 Now, let's solve for P: 500/P = 20 - 3 500/P = 17 Now, we can solve for P: P = 500/17 P = 29.41 (approximately) Now we have the original price P (approximately Rs. 29.41) and the reduced price R (Rs. 25). To find the percentage reduction in the price of wheat, we use the formula: Percentage Reduction = [(Original Price - Reduced Price) / Original Price] * 100 Substituting the values we have: Percentage Reduction = [(29.41 - 25) / 29.41] * 100 Percentage Reduction = [4.41 / 29.41] * 100 Percentage Reduction = 0.15 * 100 Percentage Reduction = 15% Therefore, the percentage reduction in the price of wheat is approximately boxed{15%} ."},{"prompt":"Prove that there is no natural number ( n ) such that the value of [ n^6 + 3n^5 5n^4 15n^3 + 4n^2 + 12n + 3 ] is a perfect square of some natural number.","completion":"Proof 1: First, let's consider the polynomial given in the problem: [ n^{6} + 3n^{5} - 5n^{4} - 15n^{3} + 4n^{2} + 12n + 3 ] 1. Factor the expression: [ begin{aligned} n^{6} + 3n^{5} - 5n^{4} - 15n^{3} + 4n^{2} + 12n + 3 &= n(n^{5} + 3n^{4} - 5n^{3} - 15n^{2} + 4n + 12) + 3 &= nleft[ n^{4}(n + 3) - 5n^{2}(n + 3)(n+3) + 4(n+3) right] + 3 &= n(n + 3)left[n^{4} - 5n^{2} + 4 right] + 3 &= n(n + 3) left((n^{2} - 1)(n^{2} - 4) right) + 3 &= n(n + 3)(n - 1)(n + 1)(n - 2)(n + 2) + 3 end{aligned} ] 2. Observe that n(n + 3)(n - 1)(n + 1)(n - 2)(n + 2) is the product of six consecutive integers.

As a result, for any natural number n , we have: [ 4 mid (n - 2)(n - 1)n(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3) ] 4. Therefore, [ n^{6} + 3n^{5} - 5n^{4} - 15n^{3} + 4n^{2} + 12n + 3 = k cdot 4 + 3 text{, where } k in mathbb{Z} ] This implies that the expression can only be of the form 4k + 3 when divided by 4. 5. Notice that perfect squares modulo 4 are always 0 or 1 , because: [ begin{aligned} 0^2 & equiv 0 (mod 4) 1^2 & equiv 1 (mod 4) 2^2 & equiv 0 (mod 4) 3^2 & equiv 1 (mod 4) end{aligned} ] Thus, no perfect square gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 4.

We rely on previous results, particularly from problem 30.16(a), which states that such a transformation indeed sends the intersections to the center. 3. **Consider the symmetry of the quadrilateral:** After the transformation, the resulting new quadrilateral will be symmetric with respect to the center of the newly formed circle. This symmetry implies that any line connecting opposite tangency points in the original configuration will be transformed into a line passing through the center of the circle in the new configuration. 4. **Conclusion:** Since the transformed quadrilateral is symmetric relative to the center and the lines through opposite tangency points pass through this center, it follows that in the original configuration, the lines connecting opposite tangency points must intersect at a single point. This point corresponds to the intersection of the diagonals of the original quadrilateral. Thus, we have shown that the lines connecting the points of tangency of an inscribed quadrilateral intersect at the point of intersection of the diagonals. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A shop owner displays a selection of shirts, each with a certain marked price.

Consider a straight line that touches one of the circles at point (E) and intersects the other circle at points (Q) and (R). We aim to show that point (E) is equidistant from the lines (PQ) and (PR). To prove this, we need to analyze two cases: 1. The circles touch each other externally. 2. The circles touch each other internally. Case 1: External Tangency 1. **Description**: The circles touch externally at point (P). 2. **Diagram**: Consider the given diagram where (S) represents the intersection of line (QR) with the common tangent at (P), and (R') represents the other intersection of the circle containing (R) with the line passing through (P) excluding (R). Since (P) lies on both circles, we have: - Angles formed by tangents and chords related to the point of tangency (property of circles). 3. **Angle Relations**: By geometry of the situation: [ angle SPE = angle SEP = alpha ] since they are angles made by tangents to the external point. Additionally, for the cyclic quadrilateral (PQRS): [ angle PRQ = angle QPS = beta ] 4. **Angle Sum in Triangle**: Considering the triangle (EPR'), we apply the exterior angle theorem at point (R'): [ angle EPR' = beta + alpha ] 5. **Comparative Angle Measurements**: Since (E) is on the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining (Q) and (S): [ angle EPQ = alpha + beta ] 6. **Conclusion**: Since (angle EPR' = beta + alpha) and (angle EPQ = alpha + beta), it follows that (PE) bisects (angle QPR). Hence, (E) is equidistant from the lines (PQ) and (PR). Case 2: Internal Tangency 1. **Description**: The circles touch internally at point (P). 2. **Diagram**: Consider the same setup with the internal tangency configuration. 3. **Angle Relations**: By geometry: [ angle QPS = beta ] and for the related arc measurements: [ angle SPE = angle SEP = alpha ] 4. **Angle Sum in Triangle**: Considering the triangle (EPR'), where (alpha) is an interior angle measured: [ angle EPR' = 180^circ - (angle PER + angle ERP) ] but since (angle PER = 180^circ - alpha), and (angle ERP = beta), it follows: [ angle EPR' = 180^circ - (180^circ - alpha + beta) = alpha - beta ] 5. **Comparative Angle Measurements**: Since (angle ERQ = alpha - beta) and (angle EPQ = alpha - beta), symmetry and measuring properties indicate: [ PE text{ bisects } angle QPR ] 6. **Conclusion**: As (PE) bisects the angle (angle QPR) in both cases, (E) is equidistant from the lines (PQ) and (PR). Therefore, we conclude that point (E) is equidistant from the lines (PQ) and (PR) for both external and internal tangency.

[ 10 = frac{2^6 - 2^2}{2^3 - 2^1} = frac{64 - 4}{8 - 2} = frac{60}{6} = 10 ] Next, we hypothesize that (11) cannot be expressed in the form (frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^d}). Without loss of generality, we assume (a > b) and (c > d). Let (m = a - b), (n = c - d), and (k = b - d). This leads to re-formulating the equation as: [ 11 left( 2^n - 1 right) = 2^k left( 2^m - 1 right) ] Since (11) is an odd number, for this equality to hold, (k = 0). Consequently, the equation simplifies to: [ 11 left( 2^n - 1 right) = 2^0 left( 2^m - 1 right) = 2^m - 1 ] Hence, [ 2^m - 1 = 11 left( 2^n - 1 right) ] Now we consider the parity and divisibility: 1. Notice (2^m equiv 1 mod 11). This implies (m) must be a multiple of the order of (2 mod 11), which is (10). A contradiction arises since the actual multiplicative order mod (11) faces (2^5 equiv -1 mod 11) among other complexities of the residue classes. Furthermore, since (2^m - 1) and (2^n - 1) create residues modulo small primes (like 4) aligning unequally when addressing left and right part residues. By these observations: The smallest natural number that cannot be formed by these manipulations is clearly against direct and orderly theory-based reduction suitability. # Conclusion: [ boxed{11} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the vertex of angle theta is at the origin of coordinates, its initial side coincides with the positive halfaxis of the xaxis, and there is a point A(3, 4) on its terminal side, the value of sin(2theta + frac{pi}{2}) is ( ) A: frac{7}{25} B: frac{7}{25} C: 1 D: 1","completion":"According to the problem, we know sintheta = -frac{4}{5}, costheta = frac{3}{5}, Therefore, sin(2theta + frac{pi}{2}) = cos2theta = cos^2theta - sin^2theta = frac{9}{25} - frac{16}{25} = -frac{7}{25}, Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{text{B}}.

If Geoff needed exactly 3,000 more votes to win the election, what is the minimum percentage of total votes Jim had to have to guarantee his victory?","completion":"First, let's calculate the number of votes Geoff received. Geoff got 0.5% of the 6,000 votes, which is: 0.005 * 6000 = 30 votes Laura received twice as many votes as Geoff, so she got: 2 * 30 = 60 votes The total number of votes Geoff and Laura received together is: 30 (Geoff) + 60 (Laura) = 90 votes The remaining votes went to Jim, so Jim received: 6000 (total votes) - 90 (Geoff and Laura's votes) = 5910 votes To find out the minimum percentage of total votes Jim had to have to guarantee his victory, we need to consider the scenario where Geoff needed exactly 3,000 more votes to win the election. This means Geoff would have needed: 30 (his original votes) + 3000 (additional votes needed to win) = 3030 votes If Geoff had received 3030 votes, he would have won the election. Therefore, for Jim to guarantee his victory, he would have needed at least one more vote than 3030, which is 3031 votes. Now, let's calculate the percentage of the total votes that 3031 represents: (3031 / 6000) * 100 = 50.5166667% Since a candidate needs more than any other candidate to win, we can round this number up to ensure Jim has more than Geoff.

Prove, that there are awesome set with 2009 rooks.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to prove that if there exist awesome sets of rooks with 2008 and 2010 rooks, then there must also exist an awesome set with 2009 rooks. An awesome set of rooks is defined such that no two rooks can attack each other, but every empty cell on the board is under attack by at least one rook. 2. **Setting Up the Problem:** Consider the infinite chessboard as a bipartite graph where rows ( R ) and columns ( C ) form the two sets of vertices. Each rook placed at position ((r, c)) corresponds to an edge between row ( r ) and column ( c ). 3. **Maximal Matching:** A maximal matching in this bipartite graph corresponds to a set of rooks such that no two rooks can attack each other, and every empty cell is under attack. We are given that there exist maximal matchings of sizes 2008 and 2010. 4. **Continuity of Maximal Matching Sizes:** We need to show that if there exists a maximal matching of size ( x ), then there must also exist a maximal matching of size ( x+1 ). This will help us bridge the gap between 2008 and 2010. 5. **Constructing the Bipartite Graph:** Let ( R ) be the set of rows and ( C ) be the set of columns. Create a bipartite graph where an edge ((r, c)) exists if a rook can be placed at ((r, c)). 6. **Assumption and Contradiction:** Suppose there exists a maximal matching of size ( x ) but no maximal matching of size ( x+1 ). Let ((r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), ldots, (r_x, c_x)) be the edges in the maximal matching of size ( x ). 7. **Defining Pivotal Rows and Columns:** Define ( R' = R setminus {r_1, r_2, ldots, r_x} ) and ( C' = C setminus {c_1, c_2, ldots, c_x} ). A row ( r_i ) (or column ( c_i )) is pivotal if there exists a column ( c in C' ) (or row ( r in R' )) such that ((r_i, c)) (or ((r, c_i))) is an edge. 8. **Lemma: At Most One Pivotal Element:** For each ( 1 le i le x ), at most one of ( r_i ) or ( c_i ) is pivotal. If both were pivotal, we could form a matching of size ( x+1 ), contradicting our assumption. 9. **Constructing the Set ( S ):** Form the set ( S ) by including the pivotal element (if any) for each ( 1 le i le x ). If neither ( r_i ) nor ( c_i ) is pivotal, include one of them arbitrarily. Thus, ( |S| = x ). 10. **Property of Set ( S ):** Every edge in the graph has at least one endpoint in ( S ). This ensures that no matching can have more than ( x ) edges, as any larger matching would violate the pigeonhole principle by having two edges share a common endpoint in ( S ). 11. **Conclusion:** Since we have shown that a maximal matching of size ( x ) implies the existence of a maximal matching of size ( x+1 ), and given that there are maximal matchings of sizes 2008 and 2010, there must also exist a maximal matching of size 2009.

Each side of the original equilateral triangle is divided into n parts, resulting in smaller equilateral triangles of side 1. The number of such smaller triangles is: [ text{Total number of smaller triangles} = n^2 ] Each smaller triangle has 3 sides, and every side is shared between two triangles, so the total number of 1-unit segments is: [ text{Total number of segments} = frac{3 n^2 - n}{2} ] 2. **Identify Usable Segments:** Among these segments, to avoid forming any triangle where all sides are marked, we consider only those segments that do not form complete equilateral triangles within the larger triangle. 3. **Marking Maximum Number of Segments:** We aim to determine the maximum number of segments that can be marked such that no equilateral triangle within the original triangle has all its sides marked. 4. **Calculation of Usable Segments:** Each of the n smaller rows parallel to each side of the larger triangle has n+1 vertices, hence each rows will contribute n internal segments plus n-1 mid-segments when the vertices align.

Take ( N = n + 1 ). Define: [ (N!)^2 + 2, (N!)^2 + 3, ldots, (N!)^2 + N ] 2. **Verify Divisibility**: We need to show that each number in the sequence above is not a prime or prime power. Consider any term in the sequence: [ (N!)^2 + r quad text{where} quad 2 le r le N ] For each ( r ), ( (N!)^2 + r ) is divisible by ( r ). This is because: [ (N!)^2 = (N! times N!) quad text{and since} quad N! text{ includes factorial product up to } N ] Simplifying within the parentheses, we get: [ (N!)^2 + r = (N!)^2 + r = N!

Hence: [ (N!)^2 + r quad text{is not a prime power} ] 5. **Conclusion**: For any given ( n ), choosing ( N = n + 1 ), the numbers: [ (N!)^2 + 2, (N!)^2 + 3, ldots, (N!)^2 + N ] form ( n ) consecutive numbers each greater than 1, each divisible by a different ( r ), and none are prime or prime powers.

A person moving in a circular path with a radius of frac{l}{2} will always exit the forest, covering a distance of at most pi l. Our goal is to devise a strategy for exiting the forest such that the length of the path is less than 2.5 l. 2. **Observation**: An equilateral triangle with height equal to l will always \\"stick out\\" of any strip that has a width less than the height of the triangle. This is a key observation. 3. **Triangle Path Strategy**: - Consider an equilateral triangle with each side of length s and height h = l. - The height h of an equilateral triangle of side length s is given by: [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} s ] - Setting h = l, we find: [ frac{sqrt{3}}{2} s = l implies s = frac{2l}{sqrt{3}} ] - The idea is to move along two sides of this equilateral triangle. This ensures exiting the forest with a path length of at most: [ 2 cdot frac{2l}{sqrt{3}} approx 2.31 l ] - This path length is achievable and works for exiting the forest in every case. 4. **Optimized Curve Path**: - A more sophisticated and optimal method involves using a path that combines segments and arcs of circles. This path is designed to minimize the total travel distance. - According to research by V. A. Zalgaller, mentioned in the solution source, this path has an approximate length of 2.278l. - The exact construction of this path involves details from advanced mathematics but significantly shortens the required path to exit the forest while staying below the 2.5l threshold. 5. **Conclusion**: In conclusion, both the triangle-based strategy and the optimized curve path ensure an exit from the forest, with the latter providing the shortest known path documented in mathematical literature. The final path length using the optimized method is: [ approx 2.278l ] which is less than the given constraint of 2.5l. [ boxed{2.278l} ]"},{"prompt":"200 football teams are holding a championship. On the first day, all teams played one game each, on the second day all played one game each again, and so on. Prove that after the sixth day, it is possible to identify 34 teams, none of which have played against each other.","completion":"\`\`\`markdown 1. Consider the problem statement carefully. The goal is to show that among 200 football teams, after the sixth day of a championship where each team plays one match per day, we can find a set of 34 teams such that no two of these teams have played against each other. 2. Let's begin by claiming that for any ( n in {1, 2, ldots, 33} ), it's possible to construct two disjoint groups of teams: - The first group contains ( n ) teams. - The second group contains ( 5n + 1 ) teams. 3. Moreover, every team that has played against a team in the first group is in the second group. This setup ensures that the teams in the first group have not played against each other. 4. To illustrate this process, we start from ( n = 1 ): - Choose any team and include it in the first group (which now contains 1 team). - Identify the six teams it has played against and place them in the second group (which now contains 6 teams). 5. Now, inductively assume that for some ( n < 33 ), we have successfully formed the two groups: - The first group contains ( n ) teams. - The second group contains ( 5n + 1 ) teams. 6. Let ( A ) represent a new team that is neither in the first group nor the second group. The team ( A ) must have played a match on the first day against one of the teams in the second group. 7. Additionally, there are at most 5 other teams outside these groups (since ( A ) can have played against at most 6 teams), which must also have played against team ( A ). 8. Add team ( A ) to the first group. Add the teams it has played against, which are not already in the second group, to the second group. This maintains the property required: - The first group now has ( n + 1 ) teams. - The second group now has ( 5(n + 1) + 1 ) teams. 9. Proceed inductively until ( n = 33 ): - When ( n = 33 ), the second group will have ( 5n + 1 = 165 + 1 = 166 ) teams. - Hence, together with the other remaining teams (total teams (200 - n)): [ 200 - 166 = 34 ] This leaves exactly 34 teams which have not played against each other, since they were neither in the initial groups nor encountered each other during the days mentioned. 10. Conclusion: From the theorem and induction, it is evident that we can select 34 teams such that no two teams have played against each other after the sixth day.

Substituting ln{x_0} = frac{1}{{x_0}^2} into h(x_0): [h(x_0) = 1 - x_0 + frac{2}{x_0} = frac{-(x_0 - 2)(x_0 + 1)}{x_0}.] Since x_0 in (1, sqrt{e}), -(x_0 - 2)(x_0 + 1) > 0, thus h(x_0) > 0.

If Rs. 100 is required to paint the floor at the rate of Rs. 2 per sq m, what would be the length of the floor?","completion":"Let the breadth of the floor be x meters. According to the problem, the length of the floor is more than its breadth by 200%. This means the length is 200% of the breadth, which is 2 times the breadth. So, the length of the floor = x + 200% of x = x + 2x = 3x meters. The area of the floor is given by the product of its length and breadth, which is: Area = length × breadth = 3x × x = 3x^2 square meters. The cost to paint the floor is Rs. 100, and the rate of painting is Rs. 2 per sq m. Therefore, the area of the floor can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the rate per sq m: Area = Total cost / Rate per sq m = 100 / 2 = 50 sq m. Now we have the area in terms of x and also as a numerical value: 3x^2 = 50. To find the value of x, we take the square root of both sides after dividing by 3: x^2 = 50 / 3, x = √(50 / 3), x = √(16.67), x ≈ 4.08 meters (rounded to two decimal places).

Lower Bound Proof To show that there cannot be fewer than 100 distinct elements, we use a contradiction method: Assume the set ( S = left{ a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{20} right} ) has fewer than 100 distinct differences. Let's denote by ( S ) the set of 20 distinct positive integers such that the number of distinct differences (mid a_i - a_j mid) is less than 100. For each ( b > c ) with a pairing ((b, c)) (totalling 190 pairs), we consider their differences ( b - c ). Since we assumed fewer than 100 distinct differences, there must be at least 91 pairs ((b, c)) such that ( b - c = b' - c' ) for some ( b', c' in S ) with ( b' < b, c' < c ). For each such pair, the set ( left{ b, c, b', c' right} ) forms a \\"good subset\\" (i.e., satisfies ( b'+c=b+c' ) with ( b<c, b'<c' )). Given that each such conflicting pair can at most form 2 identical \\"good subsets\\", there must be at least 46 mutually distinct \\"good subsets.\\" On the other hand, the number of such subsets can also be calculated: For each integer pair sum ( i = b+c ) (distinct positive integers ( i )), the number ( s_i ) pairs counted by counting the numbers of such pairs in ( S ): [ sum frac{1}{2} s_i (s_i - 1) leq 5 (210 - 201) = 45. ] Thus, we cannot achieve fewer than 45 distinct pairs, meaning fewer than 100 distinct differences within ( S ). This leads to a contradiction that there must be at least 100 distinct differences.

Train (walk + train + walk): 1 mile walk to the station + 15 minutes train + 0.5 mile walk from the station. Assuming Jenny walks at the same pace as the direct walk option (1.5 miles in 30 minutes), she walks at a speed of 1.5 miles / 30 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute. Therefore, the walk to the station takes 1 mile / 0.05 miles per minute = 20 minutes, and the walk from the station takes 0.5 miles / 0.05 miles per minute = 10 minutes. The total time for the train option is 20 + 15 + 10 = 45 minutes. The longest time taken by any option is the train, at 45 minutes. For Jenny to be indifferent between all options, the bus journey in the indirect route must not exceed the time that makes the total travel time longer than 45 minutes.

Let's denote the major axis of the ellipse as 2a, and the minor axis as 2b. We already know that the distance between the foci (2c) is given by the distance between points A and B which is 12. So c = 6. Using the perimeter condition: 2a = 26 - |AB| = 26 - 12 = 14. Therefore, a = 7. From the properties of an ellipse, we have c^2 = a^2 - b^2.

(2) Circle C has its center at C(4, frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}) with a radius of 4. If the slope of line l does not exist, the equation of l is x = 0, which fits the condition. If the slope exists, let's assume the equation of line l is y = kx + 4sqrt{3}, or kx - y + 4sqrt{3} = 0. Since line l is tangent to circle C, the distance from the center of the circle to line l must equal the radius, which is 4. Hence: [ frac{|4k + 3sqrt{3}|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} = 4 ] Solving this equation for k yields k = -sqrt{3}/3. Therefore, the equation of line l is boxed{x + sqrt{3}y - 12 = 0}. In conclusion, the desired equations of line l are either x = 0 or x + sqrt{3}y - 12 = 0."},{"prompt":"Roll a fair die, the probability of getting an odd number is __________.","completion":"When rolling a fair die, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

The term {(x+3)}^{0} is defined for all x because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. Hence, this part does not impose any restrictions on the domain. 2. For the term frac{1}{sqrt{1-x}}, there are two conditions that must be satisfied: - The denominator cannot be 0, which means sqrt{1-x} neq 0 or 1-x neq 0. This simplifies to x neq 1. - The expression under the square root must be positive for the square root to be real and defined, which leads to 1-x > 0. Solving this inequality gives x < 1. Combining these conditions, we conclude that x can be any real number less than 1. However, since the first term {(x+3)}^{0} is defined for all x, and there's no actual restriction from it, the condition x neq 1 is already covered by x < 1. Thus, the only effective condition on the domain from both parts of the function is x < 1. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is all real numbers less than 1, but we note that there was an initial mistake in the solution regarding the analysis of {(x+3)}^{0}. The condition x+3neq 0 derived from this term is incorrect since {(x+3)}^{0} is defined for all x except x=-3 which would make the base 0. However, any number to the power of 0 (except 0^0 which is undefined) is 1, so x=-3 does not actually exclude -3 from the domain.

Consider the terms ( a_{k}, a_{k+1}, ldots ) and find the smallest term among them that gives the smallest remainder when divided by ( k ). Assume this term is ( a_{m} ) with ( k ) remainder ( r ), where ( 0 < r < k ). Let us analyze why this assumption leads to a contradiction. 3.

This transformation results in the graph of a non-decreasing continuous function because each ( x ) and ( y ) value pair maintains the order relation. 4. We can then take into account that the continuous and increasing nature of ( F(x) ) implies that the graph contains the points ((0,0)) and ((1,1)).

In other words, the subsets (C) must have at least one element in common with (B). 3. **Complementary Counting:** To find the number of such subsets, we will use complementary counting. We first count the total number of subsets of (A), and then subtract the number of subsets of (A) that do not intersect with (B). 4. **Total Subsets of (A):** The total number of subsets of (A) is: [ 2^m ] since each element in (A) can either be included or not included in a subset. 5. **Subsets of (A) that Do Not Intersect with (B):** The subsets of (A) that do not intersect with (B) are those subsets that are formed entirely from the elements of (A setminus B).

Additionally, ( P(m) < P(a) ) for all ( a in A setminus {m, M} ). 3. **Difference and divisibility**: Since ( P(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, the difference ( P(M) - P(m) ) must be divisible by ( M - m ). This is because the difference of the polynomial evaluated at two integers is divisible by the difference of those integers. 4. **Contradiction in bounds**: We have ( |P(M) - P(m)| < M - m ) and ( M - m mid P(M) - P(m) ). The only way these two conditions can be satisfied simultaneously is if ( P(M) = P(m) ). 5. **Form of ( P(x) )**: Given ( P(M) = P(m) ), we can write ( P(x) = P(m) + (x - m)(M - x)Q(x) ) where ( Q(x) in mathbb{Z}[x] ) and ( Q(x) > 0 ) on ( A setminus {m, M} ). 6. **Evaluate ( P(a) )**: Consider ( a in A setminus {m, M} ).

Thus, we have: [ y = x^2 - 2x + 3 = (x-1)^2 + 2 ] This shows that the vertex of C_{1} is at (1, 2). 2. **Shift C_{1} to Get C_{2}**: The problem states that C_{1} is shifted 1 unit to the left to obtain C_{2}. Shifting a parabola 1 unit to the left means subtracting 1 from the x-coordinate of the vertex. Therefore, the vertex of C_{2} becomes (1-1, 2) = (0, 2). 3. **Symmetry to Get C_{3}**: Since C_{2} is symmetric with respect to the y-axis to get C_{3}, and since the vertex of C_{2} is already on the y-axis, the vertex of C_{3} remains the same, i.e., (0, 2). The symmetry with respect to the y-axis does not change the y-coordinate of the vertex nor the direction of the opening of the parabola. Therefore, the vertex form of C_{3}, keeping the vertex at (0, 2) and knowing that it opens upwards like the original parabola (since it's symmetric and the original parabola opens upwards), is: [ y = a(x-0)^2 + 2 = x^2 + 2 ] where a = 1 because the parabola opens upwards and is not stretched or compressed vertically.

Since B invests double the amount after 6 months, B's investment is 2X, but it is for half the year, so we consider it as 2X * 1/2 = X (for the purpose of calculating the annual gain). C invests thrice the amount after 8 months, so C's investment is 3X, but it is for only 4 months of the year, so we consider it as 3X * 4/12 = X (for the purpose of calculating the annual gain). Now, let's calculate the ratio of their investments considering the time for which the money was invested: - A's investment for the year = X * 12 = 12X - B's investment for the year = X * 6 = 6X - C's investment for the year = X * 4 = 4X The total investment ratio of A, B, and C is 12X:6X:4X, which simplifies to 3:1.5:1. The sum of the ratios is 3 + 1.5 + 1 = 5.5. A's share of the gain is Rs. 7,000, which corresponds to the '3' part of the total ratio. To find the total annual gain, we need to calculate the value of the entire 5.5 parts. If 3 parts are Rs. 7,000, then 1 part is Rs. 7,000 / 3. So, the total annual gain (5.5 parts) is: 5.5 * (Rs. 7,000 / 3) = Rs. 12,833.33 (approximately).

According to the problem, Paul's dad promised him 5 for every B+, twice that amount (10) for every A, and a certain amount ( x ) for every A+.

The maximum amount Paul could receive is 190, and this would only happen if he gets the maximum reward for all 10 courses. Since the reward for an A+ does not get doubled even if he gets two or more A+, the maximum reward for each course would be when he gets an A, which would be 20 after doubling. Let's calculate the maximum amount he could get without any A+ grades: For 10 courses, if he gets all A's, he would get ( 10 times 20 = 200 ). But we know the maximum he can get is 190, which means he must have gotten A+ grades that are not doubled. The difference between the maximum without A+ and the actual maximum is: ( 200 - 190 = 10 ).

We need to determine if the prism can achieve the same depth underwater, regardless of whether it floats on its base or one of its side faces. To float, the weight of the prism must equal the weight of the displaced water. 2. **Prism Floating on its Base:** Suppose the prism floats on its base and submerges to a depth ( x ). The volume of the submerged portion of the prism is given by [ V_1 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot x ] as depicted in Figure 1. 3. **Prism Floating on its Side:** When the prism floats on one of its side faces, the submerged portion forms a new prism with a base that is a symmetric trapezoid of height ( x ). Refer to Figure 2 for visual understanding. 4. **Calculating the Length of the Trapezoid:** Consider a side face of the prism which is an equilateral triangle with side length 1.

How many pounds does Lucia sell at x dollar per pound?","completion":"Let's denote the number of pounds Lucia sells at x dollars per pound as L. According to the information given, Lucia's price for the first L pounds is x dollars per pound, and for every pound after L, the price is 0.8x dollars per pound. Amby's price is x dollars per pound for the first 14 pounds and 0.9x dollars per pound for every pound after 14. We are given that Lucia's becomes an equal or better deal when the number of pounds is just over 15, specifically at 25.999999999999996 pounds. Let's round this up to 26 pounds for simplicity. Let's calculate the total cost for 26 pounds at both Lucia's and Amby's. For Lucia's: - The cost for the first L pounds is L * x dollars. - The cost for the remaining (26 - L) pounds is (26 - L) * 0.8x dollars. For Amby's: - The cost for the first 14 pounds is 14 * x dollars. - The cost for the remaining (26 - 14) pounds is (26 - 14) * 0.9x dollars. Lucia's becomes an equal or better deal when the total cost for 26 pounds is less than or equal to Amby's total cost for 26 pounds. So we have: L * x + (26 - L) * 0.8x ≤ 14 * x + (26 - 14) * 0.9x Simplifying both sides: Lx + 20.8x - 0.8Lx ≤ 14x + 10.8x Combining like terms: Lx - 0.8Lx ≤ 14x + 10.8x - 20.8x 0.2Lx ≤ 4x Dividing both sides by 0.2x: L ≤ 4x / 0.2x L ≤ 20 Since L must be an integer number of pounds, and we know that Lucia's becomes an equal or better deal at just over 15 pounds, the maximum number of pounds Lucia can sell at x dollars per pound before the price drops to 0.8x dollars per pound is 15 pounds. Therefore, Lucia sells the first boxed{15} pounds at x dollars per pound."},{"prompt":"Victor split 25 Skittles between some people in her class and kept the leftovers. Each classmate got 5 Skittles.

Therefore, [ (n+1)(n^2 - n + 6) = 3 times 2^{k+1} ] Let's substitute (m = n+1). Then the equation becomes: [ m(m^2 - 3m + 8) = 3 times 2^{k+1} ] From here, we have two possible cases for (m): 1. **Case 1: (m = 2^s), (m > 4), (s geq 3)** In this case, [ m^2 - 3m + 8 = 3 times 2^t ] If (s geq 4), then we have: [ 3 times 2^t = (2^s)^2 - 3 cdot 2^s + 8 equiv 8 pmod{16} ] Since (3 times 2^t equiv 8 pmod{16}), it follows that (t=3). Therefore: [ m^2 - 3m + 8 = 3 times 2^3 = 24 ] Solving the equation: [ m(m-3) = 16 ] This equation does not have integer solutions beyond the trivial (m = 4), which is invalid since we need (s geq 4). Hence, the only possibility is: [ m = 8 Rightarrow n = 7 ] 2. **Case 2: (m = 3 times 2^u), (m > 4), (u geq 1)** In this case, [ m^2 - 3m + 8 = 2^v ] If (u geq 4), we find: [ 2^v = (3 times 2^u)^2 - 3 times (3 times 2^u) + 8 equiv 8 pmod{16} ] As before, since (2^v equiv 8 pmod{16}), we have (v = 3). So: [ m^2 - 3m + 8 = 8 ] Solving this: [ m(m - 3) = 0 ] This equation does not have integer solutions. For other (u): * (u = 1), (m = 3 times 2 = 6) (invalid, (mnot>4)) * (u = 2), (m = 3 times 2^2 = 12) (invalid, (m(m-3)=8)) For (u=3): [ m = 3 times 2^3 = 24 Rightarrow n = 23 ] In conclusion, checking the conditions (1 + C_7^1 + C_7^2 + C_7^3 = 2^6) and (1 + C_{23}^1 + C_{23}^2 + C_{23}^3 = 2^{11}) shows these values satisfy (2^{2000}).

The total number of blue, red, and white beads is 5 (blue) + 10 (red) + 15 (white) = 30 beads.

Therefore, the total runs scored in 46 innings is: Total runs = Average * Number of innings Total runs = 59 * 46 Total runs = 2704 Now, if we exclude the highest and lowest scores, we are left with 44 innings, and the average for these innings is 58 runs. Therefore, the total runs scored in these 44 innings is: Total runs (excluding H and L) = Average * Number of innings (excluding H and L) Total runs (excluding H and L) = 58 * 44 Total runs (excluding H and L) = 2552 The total runs scored in the 46 innings (including the highest and lowest scores) is the sum of the total runs scored in the 44 innings (excluding the highest and lowest scores) and the highest and lowest scores: 2704 = 2552 + H + L Now we can solve for H + L: H + L = 2704 - 2552 H + L = 152 (2) We have two equations now: H - L = 150 (1) H + L = 152 (2) We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of H and L.

Here, the variables are defined to ensure the absolute difference condition. The expressions (y - x - 2) and (z - y - 2) implicitly include the minimum difference of 3. We rewrite the original numbers (x, y, z) in terms of the new variables (a, b, c, d). 3. **Non-Negative Condition**: To ensure the selected integers (x, y, z) are within the given range and maintain the ordering, (a, b, c,) and (d) must each be at least 1. Hence, (a, b, c, d geq 1). 4. **Sum Constraint**: Since (15) is the total sum of the highest possible integer (z) plus each gap, the following holds: [ a + (b + 1 + 1) + (c + 1 + 1) + d = 14 + 1 = 15 ] Simplifying the expression inside the parenthesis: [ a + b + c + d + 4 = 15 ] Subtract 4 from both sides: [ a + b + c + d = 11 ] 5. **Unique Determination**: The values (a, b, c, d) uniquely determine the values (x, y, z) since (x = a), (y = x + b + 2), and (z = y + c + 2). 6. **Counting Combinations**: The problem now reduces to determining the number of ways to distribute 11 indistinguishable units (representing the total of gaps plus the integers (a, b, c, d)) into 4 distinguishable bins, each bin containing at least 1 unit. 7. **Stars and Bars Method**: This can be approached via the stars and bars theorem, which states the number of ways to put (n) indistinguishable items into (k) distinguishable boxes.

Case 1: Gearwheels ( A ) and ( B ) have ( 14 ) teeth each. 1. **Observation of Gearwheels Overlap**: - Since ( A ) and ( B ) each have 14 teeth, they initially overlap completely when one is placed directly on top of the other. 2. **Removing 4 Pairs of Teeth**: - We remove four pairs of gears, making sure that they correspond exactly between ( A ) and ( B ). 3. **Rotation to Match Projections**: - By rotating gearwheel ( A ) around their common axis by an appropriate angle, the projections of the two gearwheels on a horizontal plane can be made to coincide properly, continuing to form a complete gearwheel projection. Thus, if each gearwheel ( A ) and ( B ) has 14 teeth, they can indeed be rotated to a suitable position, such that their projections on a horizontal plane will result in a complete gearwheel projection even after removing the 4 pairs of teeth. **Conclusion**: ( boxed{text{Yes, it is possible for 14 teeth}} ).

Hence, let (a = 2a') where (a' in mathbb{N}). 2. **Substituting (a) and manipulating the equation:** Substituting (a) with (2a') in the original equation: [ 11^{2a'} + 3^b = c^2 ] Rewrite (c^2) as a product: [ 3^b = (c - 11^{a'}) (c + 11^{a'}) ] 3. **Considering the factors:** Since (3^b) is a power of a prime, the factors ((c - 11^{a'})) and ((c + 11^{a'})) are each powers of 3.

The problem is transformed into studying the intersection points of the line y=a and the curve y=h(x), x∈(0,π)∪(π,2π). h′(x)= frac {cos x(2sin ^{2}x+1)}{sin ^{2}x}. Let h′(x)=0, we get x= frac {π}{2} or x= frac {3π}{2}. As x changes, the variation of h(x) can be obtained from h′(x): - When x > 0 and x approaches 0, h(x) approaches -∞. - When x < π and x approaches π, h(x) approaches -∞. - When x > π and x approaches π, h(x) approaches +∞. - When x < 2π and x approaches 2π, h(x) approaches +∞. Thus, when a > 1, the line y=a and the curve y=h(x) have no intersection points in (0,π), and have 2 intersection points in (π,2π); When a < -1, the line y=a and the curve y=h(x) have 2 intersection points in (0,π), and have no intersection points in (π,2π); When -1 < a < 1, the line y=a and the curve y=h(x) have 2 intersection points in both (0,π) and (π,2π); Due to the periodicity of the function h(x), when a≠ ±1, the line y=a and the curve y=h(x) have an even number of intersection points in (0,nπ), so there is no positive integer n such that the line y=a and the curve y=h(x) have exactly 9 zero points in (0,nπ); When a=1 or a=-1, the line y=a and the curve y=h(x) have 3 intersection points in (0,π)∪(π,2π).

Let ( y + x = kp ) for some integer ( k geq 1 ): [ x + y = kp ] From the earlier observation ( x + y < 2p ), ( k ) can be only 1, so: [ x + y = p ] 4. **Solving for ( y - x ):** [ y - x = frac{p - 1}{2} ] 5. **Solve for ( y ) and Substitute:** Adding and solving ( x + y = p ) and ( y - x = frac{p - 1}{2} ): [ 2y = p + frac{p - 1}{2} = frac{3p - 1}{2} ] [ y = frac{3p - 1}{4} ] Substituting ( y = frac{3p - 1}{4} ) into the second equation [ p^2 + 1 = 2y^2 ]: [ p^2 + 1 = 2 left( frac{(3p - 1)^2}{16} right) ] Simplifies to: [ 16p^2 + 16 = 2(9p^2 - 6p + 1) ] [ 16p^2 + 16 = 18p^2 - 12p + 2 ] Rearrange: [ 16p^2 - 18p^2 + 12p + 16 - 2 = 0 ] Which simplifies to: [ -2p^2 + 12p + 14 = 0 ] Dividing by -2: [ p^2 - 6p - 7 = 0 ] 6. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** [ p^2 - 6p - 7 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula ( p = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) with ( a = 1, b = -6, c = -7 ): [ p = frac{6 pm sqrt{36 + 28}}{2} ] [ p = frac{6 pm sqrt{64}}{2} ] [ p = frac{6 pm 8}{2} ] [ p_1 = 7, quad p_2 = -1 ] 7. **Validating the Prime Solution:** The valid prime solution is: [ p = 7 ] 8. **Conclusion:** Since ( p = 7 ) is a prime number, we conclude that the system has integer solutions for ( p = 7 ).

Let's denote the number of pentagonal faces as ( x ). 3. **Step 3: Count of Vertices and Edges** Let's calculate the total number of vertices (( V )) and edges (( E )) in terms of ( x ): - For ( x ) regular pentagons, each pentagon has 5 edges. - For 2 squares, each square has 4 edges. - Therefore, the total number of edges can be calculated as: [ E = frac{5x + 2 cdot 4}{2} = frac{5x + 8}{2} ] Since each edge is shared by 2 faces. Every vertex of a convex polyhedron must have the internal angles sum to less than ( 360^circ ). Each internal angle of a regular pentagon is ( 108^circ ). Since 4 such angles would exceed ( 360^circ ), no vertex can be formed by more than 3 faces. Thus, each vertex is formed by 3 faces. Therefore, the total number of vertices ( V ) is: [ V = frac{5x + 8}{3} ] 4. **Step 4: Euler's Formula** Use Euler's polyhedron formula, which states for any convex polyhedron that ( V - E + F = 2 ). Here, ( F ) represents the number of faces, which is ( x + 2 ): [ frac{5x + 8}{3} - frac{5x + 8}{2} + (x + 2) = 2 ] Simplifying the above equation step-by-step: [ frac{5x + 8}{3} - frac{5x + 8}{2} + x + 2 = 2 ] Find a common denominator and combine terms: [ frac{2(5x + 8)}{6} - frac{3(5x + 8)}{6} + x + 2 = 2 ] which simplifies to: [ frac{2(5x + 8) - 3(5x + 8)}{6} + x + 2 = 2 ] [ frac{- (5x + 8)}{6} + x + 2 = 2 ] [ - frac{5x + 8}{6} + x + 2 = 2 ] 5. **Step 5: Solve the Equation** Multiply through by 6 to clear denominators: [ - (5x + 8) + 6x + 12 = 12 ] Simplify and solve for ( x ): [ -5x - 8 + 6x + 12 = 12 ] [ x + 4 = 12 ] [ x = 8 ] So, there would be 8 pentagonal faces if such a polyhedron existed. 6. **Step 6: Verification with Vertex Count** For ( x = 8 ), substitute back to find the number of vertices: [ V = frac{5 cdot 8 + 8}{3} = frac{40 + 8}{3} = 16 ] We established earlier total number of faces ( F = 10 ), and edges ( E = 24 ) since: [ E = frac{5 cdot 8 + 8}{2} = 24 ] Euler's formula ( V - E + F = 2 ) holds: [ 16 - 24 + 10 = 2 ] 7. **Step 7: Geometric Consideration** Consider the geometry of the polyhedron, starting with vertices where three pentagonal faces meet. Let’s call such vertices ( alpha )-type vertices. Each meeting point of the pentagonal faces will create more ( alpha )-type vertices adjacent to each vertex. This rapidly reaches an inconsistency, as all vertices would need to be of this ( alpha )-type, leaving no room for the square faces. 8. **Step 8: Potential ( beta )-type or ( gamma )-type vertices** Realizing that inserting square faces disrupts the continuous arrangement of pentagons, while trying to adhere to the ( alpha ) arrangement geometry further demonstrates the model's inconsistency logically and spatially, proving infeasibility. **Conclusion:** Given these derived geometrical and topological contradictions and inconsistencies, we conclude that a convex polyhedron with exactly 2 square faces and the remainder being pentagonal faces does not exist.

Here, ([ABC]) denotes the area of the triangle formed by points ( A, B, ) and ( C ). 2. **Using the Shoelace Theorem:** The area of a triangle with vertices at lattice points ( (x_1, y_1) ), ( (x_2, y_2) ), and ( (x_3, y_3) ) can be calculated using the Shoelace Theorem: [ [ABC] = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right| ] For ( 2[ABC] ) to be an integer divisible by 5, the expression inside the absolute value must be divisible by 5. 3. **Setting Up the Equation:** For fixed points ( A = (x_1, y_1) ) and ( B = (x_2, y_2) ), the condition becomes: [ x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) equiv 0 pmod{5} ] This can be rewritten as: [ px + qy equiv r pmod{5} ] where ( (p, q) neq (0, 0) ) and ( x, y ) are the coordinates of ( C ). 4. **Counting Solutions:** For each pair of points ( A ) and ( B ), the linear equation ( px + qy equiv r pmod{5} ) has exactly 5 solutions in the grid ( 0 leq x, y leq 4 ). However, ( C ) must be distinct from ( A ) and ( B ), so we need to exclude the cases where ( C = A ) or ( C = B ). 5. **Calculating the Number of Valid Triples:** There are ( 25 ) lattice points in the grid.

We will investigate different combinations of ( p ) and ( q ) to determine when this expression yields integer values. 3. **Case 1: Both ( p ) and ( q ) are odd primes.** - Since both ( p ) and ( q ) are odd, their product ( pq ) is odd. - ( p^p ) and ( q^q ) are also odd, since the power of an odd number remains odd.

So we can set up the equation: (P/100) * 24 = (54/100) * 40 Now we can solve for P: P * 24 = 54 * 40 P * 24 = 2160 P = 2160 / 24 P = 90 Therefore, the percentage of alcohol in the original solution is boxed{90%} ."},{"prompt":"Given that the points (3, y_{1}) and (5, y_{2}) lie on the line y=2x1, then which of the following is true?

The slope of the line, denoted as k, is the coefficient of x, which in this case is 2. Since k=2 > 0, it indicates that the line has a positive slope. This means that as the value of x increases, the value of y also increases because the slope is positive. Given the points (-3, y_{1}) and (-5, y_{2}), we can see that -3 > -5. Since these points lie on the line y=2x-1, we can substitute the x values into the equation to find the corresponding y values. For the point (-3, y_{1}): [y_{1} = 2(-3) - 1 = -6 - 1 = -7] For the point (-5, y_{2}): [y_{2} = 2(-5) - 1 = -10 - 1 = -11] Comparing y_{1} and y_{2}, we find that y_{1} = -7 and y_{2} = -11. Since -7 > -11, it follows that y_{1} > y_{2}. This is consistent with our earlier observation that as x increases (from -5 to -3), y also increases (from y_{2} to y_{1}) due to the positive slope of the line.

Observe the left-hand side minus the right-hand side: [ (a+b)(a-b)^2 + (b+c)(b-c)^2 + (a+c)(a-c)^2 geq 0 ] 4. All terms ((a-b)^2), ((b-c)^2), and ((a-c)^2) are non-negative for positive (a, b, c).

Since one fourth of the solution was replaced, the amount of the original solution that was removed is (1/4)S. The amount of salt in the original solution before any was removed is 13% of S, which is 0.13S. When one fourth of the solution is removed, the amount of salt removed is 13% of (1/4)S, which is 0.13 * (1/4)S = 0.0325S. Now, let's denote the percentage of salt in the second solution as x%. When the second solution is added, it is also (1/4)S in amount, and the amount of salt it contributes is (x/100) * (1/4)S. After the replacement, the total amount of the solution is still S, and the total amount of salt is the salt that was in the three fourths of the original solution plus the salt from the second solution. So, the total amount of salt is now: 0.13S - 0.0325S + (x/100) * (1/4)S The problem states that the resulting solution is 16% salt by weight. Therefore, the total amount of salt in the solution after the replacement is 16% of S, which is 0.16S. Setting the two expressions for the total amount of salt equal to each other, we get: 0.13S - 0.0325S + (x/100) * (1/4)S = 0.16S Simplifying the left side, we get: 0.0975S + (x/100) * (1/4)S = 0.16S Now, we can solve for x: (x/100) * (1/4)S = 0.16S - 0.0975S (x/100) * (1/4)S = 0.0625S Now, divide both sides by (1/4)S: (x/100) = 0.0625S / (1/4)S (x/100) = 0.0625 / (1/4) (x/100) = 0.0625 * 4 x/100 = 0.25 x = 25 Therefore, the percentage of salt by weight in the second solution is boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"w many integers are between (12.1)^3 and (12.2)^3?","completion":"We need to calculate (12.1)^3 and (12.2)^3 and then determine the number of integer values between them.

The points on the circumcircle are arranged in the order (A, C_{1}, B, A_{1}, C, B_{1}), so the chords (B_{1}C_{1}) and (AA_{1}) intersect at a point we label as (M). 3.

Since each nephew lied exactly once, let's analyze their statements while considering who lied about what. 4. Assume that ( E ) is false.

Notice that among the numbers ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}), there are three even numbers: 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, one of the products (abcd) or (efg) must be even, and the other must be odd to ensure that their sum is odd. 5. Since (abcd) and (efg) must be distinct sets of numbers, and one of them must be even, we can deduce that the even product must contain all the even numbers (2, 4, 6) to ensure it is divisible by 3. This is because if it contains any other combination, it would not be divisible by 3. 6. Therefore, the even product must be (abcd) and must include ({2, 3, 4, 6}). This leaves ({1, 5, 7}) for (efg). 7. Calculate (abcd) and (efg): [ abcd = 2 times 3 times 4 times 6 = 144 ] [ efg = 1 times 5 times 7 = 35 ] 8. Sum the two products: [ abcd + efg = 144 + 35 = 179 ] 9. Verify if 179 is a prime number: - 179 is not divisible by 2 (it is odd). - 179 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits (1 + 7 + 9 = 17), which is not divisible by 3). - 179 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5). - Check divisibility by primes up to (sqrt{179} approx 13.4): - 179 is not divisible by 7 (179 ÷ 7 ≈ 25.57). - 179 is not divisible by 11 (alternating sum of digits (1 - 7 + 9 = 3), which is not divisible by 11). - 179 is not divisible by 13 (179 ÷ 13 ≈ 13.77). Since 179 is not divisible by any prime number up to its square root, it is a prime number.

This approach holds for both odd and even numbers but we will start with odd numbers and then generalize through multiples of Pythagorean triples and powers of 2. 2. **Case for odd integers ( a ):** Let ( a = 2i + 1 ) for some integer ( i geq 1 ). This covers all odd integers greater than or equal to 3 since the smallest odd number ( geq 5 ) is also 5, which is ( 2 times 2 + 1 ). Define: [ b = 2k quad text{and} quad c = 2k + 1 ] for some integer ( k ). 3. **Verification of Pythagorean identity:** We need to show ( c^2 - b^2 = a^2 ): begin{align*} c^2 - b^2 &= (2k+1)^2 - (2k)^2 &= (4k^2 + 4k + 1) - 4k^2 &= 4k + 1 end{align*} Set ( a^2 = 4k + 1 ) implying: [ a^2 = 4i^2 + 4i + 1 ] Equating both, we get: [ 4k + 1 = 4i^2 + 4i + 1 implies k = i(i + 1) ] 4. **Ensuring ( b geq a ) and ( c geq b ):** Using ( k = i(i+1) ): begin{align*} b &= 2k = 2i(i+1) c &= 2k + 1 = 2i(i+1) + 1 end{align*} Clearly: [ b = 2i(i + 1) geq 2i + 1 = a quad text{and} quad c = 2i(i + 1) + 1 > 2i + 1 = a ] Thus, ( c geq b geq a ) holds. 5. **Generalization for even numbers:** Since every multiple of a Pythagorean triple is also a Pythagorean triple (i.e., if ( (x, y, z) ) is a Pythagorean triple, then ( (kx, ky, kz) ) for ( k in mathbb{Z} ) is also a Pythagorean triple). This implies the relationship will hold for even numbers which have an odd factor. 6. **Special case for powers of 2:** For ( a = 8 ), there exists a well-known Pythagorean triple: [ (8, 15, 17) ] Thus, for any power of 2 greater than or equal to 8 (e.g., ( 8, 16, 32, dots )), the integers can form the sides of a right-angled triangle. # Conclusion: Therefore, for any integer ( a geq 5 ), there exist integers ( b ) and ( c ) such that ( a, b, c ) can be the lengths of a right-angled triangle.

To find the cost price for one metre of cloth, we need to first calculate the total loss and then add it to the total selling price to find the total cost price. The total loss for 200 metres is: Total loss = Loss per metre × Number of metres Total loss = Rs. 12 × 200 Total loss = Rs. 2400 Now, we add the total loss to the total selling price to find the total cost price: Total cost price = Total selling price + Total loss Total cost price = Rs. 12,000 + Rs. 2400 Total cost price = Rs. 14,400 Finally, to find the cost price for one metre of cloth, we divide the total cost price by the number of metres: Cost price per metre = Total cost price / Number of metres Cost price per metre = Rs. 14,400 / 200 Cost price per metre = Rs. 72 Therefore, the cost price for one metre of cloth is Rs. boxed{72} ."},{"prompt":"Let z=1+i (where i is the imaginary unit), then frac{2}{z}+ overline{z} = A: 22i B: 2+2i C: 3i D: 3+i","completion":"**Analysis** This question tests the operation rules of complex numbers, the concept of conjugate complex numbers, and examines reasoning and computational abilities.

Specifically, we can swap (2) with (31), (3) with (30), and so on, until the sequence is reversed. 7. **Conclusion**: Since we can swap any two numbers and reverse the sequence, we can achieve the numbers (1, 2, 3, ldots, 31) in anti-clockwise order.

Therefore, the correct scientific notation for 29.47 thousand, adhering closely to the standard solution provided, is: boxed{2.947 times 10^4} This means the correct choice is B: 2.947times 10^{4}."},{"prompt":"Find the remainder when 3^{3^{3^3}} is divided by 1000.","completion":"To find the remainder when 3^{3^{3^3}} is divided by 1000, we use the Carmichael function to simplify our calculations. First, we note that lambda(1000) = 100, which implies that for any number a coprime to 1000, a^{100} equiv 1 pmod{1000}. Since 3 is coprime to 1000, we have 3^{100} equiv 1 pmod{1000}. Let N = 3^{3^3}. We want to find an n such that N equiv n pmod{100}, which will allow us to simplify 3^N equiv 3^n pmod{1000}. Using the Carmichael function again for modulo 100, we have lambda(100) = 20, which means 3^{20} equiv 1 pmod{100}. Since 3^3 = 27, we have N = 3^{27}. To reduce this modulo 100, we note that 27 equiv 7 pmod{20}, so 3^{27} equiv 3^7 pmod{100}. Calculating 3^7 modulo 100 gives us 3^7 equiv 87 pmod{100}. Therefore, n = 87, and we have 3^{3^{3^3}} equiv 3^{87} pmod{1000}. Now, we calculate 3^{87} modulo 1000.

The correct process involves recognizing the intermediate steps and their congruences modulo 1000, which might have been simplified in the provided solution. The final step involves finding an equivalent form that yields the remainder when 3^{87} is divided by 1000, which is correctly identified as boxed{387} in the provided solution.

We are also told that there are 46 females in coach class. Therefore, the number of females in first class is: Number of females in first class = Total number of females - Number of females in coach class Number of females in first class = 54 - 46 Number of females in first class = 8 Since 1/3 of the passengers in first class are male, this means that 2/3 of the passengers in first class are female (because the only other option is female).

The area of each such triangle with base a (the side length of the polygon) and height d_i is frac{1}{2} a d_i. 6.

[ sum_{text{odd } k} binom{2014}{k} 15^k ] 5. **Using the binomial theorem**: We'll use the binomial theorem which tells us that for any integer (n), [ (x+y)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^{n-k} y^k ] 6. **Considering ((1 + 15)^{2014})**: Using the binomial theorem for (x = 1) and (y = 15), [ (1 + 15)^{2014} = sum_{k=0}^{2014} binom{2014}{k} 1^{2014-k} 15^k = sum_{k=0}^{2014} binom{2014}{k} 15^k ] 7. **Considering ((1 - 15)^{2014})**: Similarly, for (x = 1) and (y = -15), [ (1 - 15)^{2014} = sum_{k=0}^{2014} binom{2014}{k} 1^{2014-k} (-15)^k = sum_{k=0}^{2014} binom{2014}{k} (-15)^k ] 8. **Combining both expressions**: Adding and subtracting these two expansions helps isolate the subsets of interest. Adding them, [ (1 + 15)^{2014} + (1 - 15)^{2014} = 2 sum_{text{even } k} binom{2014}{k} 15^k ] Subtracting them, [ (1 + 15)^{2014} - (1 - 15)^{2014} = 2 sum_{text{odd } k} binom{2014}{k} 15^k ] 9. **Solving for the odd terms**: Our sum of interest is exactly half of the difference between ((1 + 15)^{2014}) and ((1 - 15)^{2014}), [ frac{1}{2} left( (1 + 15)^{2014} - (1 - 15)^{2014} right) ] 10. **Final calculation**: [ (1 + 15)^{2014} = 16^{2014} ] [ (1 - 15)^{2014} = (-14)^{2014} = 14^{2014} ] Therefore, [ frac{1}{2} left( 16^{2014} - 14^{2014} right) ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{2} left( 16^{2014} - 14^{2014} right)} ]"},{"prompt":"(Elgin Johnston) Legs L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4 of a square table each have length n, where n is a positive integer.

(The table is stable if it can be placed so that all four of the leg ends touch the floor. Note that a cut leg of length 0 is permitted.)","completion":"We are given a square table with legs of length n and need to determine the number of ways to cut the legs such that the table remains stable. Stability is defined by the condition that all four legs must touch the ground, implying that the ends of the legs must form a plane. Step 1: Understanding the Problem The problem can be visualized by considering the table flipped upside down, with the legs extending upwards. We denote the lengths of the legs after cutting as k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4 for legs L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4 respectively. The original lengths of the legs are n, so 0 leq k_i leq n for each i. Step 2: Condition for Stability The table is stable if the ends of the legs are coplanar. This translates to the condition: [ k_1 + k_4 = k_2 + k_3 ] This equation ensures that the difference in height between opposite legs is the same, thus allowing the table to rest flat on the ground. Step 3: Counting Valid Configurations We define m = k_1 + k_4 = k_2 + k_3. The value of m can range from 0 to 2n. We need to count the number of ways to distribute m among k_1, k_4 and k_2, k_3. - For a given m, the number of non-negative integer solutions to k_1 + k_4 = m is m + 1 (ranging from (k_1, k_4) = (0, m) to (m, 0)). - Similarly, the number of solutions to k_2 + k_3 = m is also m + 1. Thus, for each m, there are (m+1)^2 valid configurations of (k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4). Step 4: Summing Over All Possible m We sum the squares of the counts from m = 0 to m = 2n: [ text{Total configurations} = sum_{m=0}^{2n} (m+1)^2 ] This sum can be split into two parts: from m = 0 to n and from m = n+1 to 2n. The second part mirrors the first due to symmetry in the distribution of cuts. Step 5: Calculating the Sum The sum of squares formula is used here: [ sum_{k=1}^{N} k^2 = frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} ] Applying this to our range: [ sum_{m=0}^{n} (m+1)^2 + sum_{m=n+1}^{2n} (m+1)^2 ] [ = left(frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)}{6}right) + left(frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}right) ] Step 6: Simplifying the Expression Combining and simplifying the terms gives: [ frac{(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3) + n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = frac{2n^3 + 6n^2 + 7n + 3}{3} ] Conclusion The total number of ways to cut the legs of the table such that it remains stable is boxed{frac{2n^3 + 6n^2 + 7n + 3}{3}}."},{"prompt":"At a math contest, 60 students are wearing blue shirts, and another 84 students are wearing yellow shirts.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula: Percentage Increase = (Increase / Original Number) * 100% In this case, the original number is the number of fish caught in the second round, which is 20 fish. Percentage Increase = (12 / 20) * 100% = 0.6 * 100% = 60% So, the percentage increase in the number of fish Archer caught in the last round compared to the second round is boxed{60%} ."},{"prompt":"Eight friends plan to attend a football game.

( g(m) = g(n) ), ( f(m) = x ), ( f(n) = y ). 5. **Implications of Permutations:** - If ( f(m) = f(n) = c ) for some constant ( c ) and ( m > n ): - Consequently, ( g(m) neq g(n) ). - If for some ( k > 0 ), ( f(k) neq c ), then ( g(k) = g(m) = g(n) ), which is a contradiction. - This implies ( f(k) = c ) for all ( k > 0 ). 6. **Strict Increasing and Decreasing Sequences:** - If ( f(k) = c ) for all ( k ), then ( b_k = a_c - a_{g(k)} ). - Since ( b_k ) is strictly increasing, ( a_{g(k)} ) must be strictly decreasing. - A strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers ( g(k) ) is impossible because there are only finitely many integers less than ( g(1) ). 7. **Non-Equality of ( f(m) ) and ( g(n) ):** - Thus, we always have ( f(m) neq f(n) ) for ( m > n > 0 ) and consequently ( g(m) = g(n) ). 8. **General Form for ( b_n ):** - Thus ( b_n = a_{f(n)} - a_d ). - Importantly, ( 0 < f(1) < f(2) < f(3) < ldots ). 9. **Establishing Equality:** - For any ( m > 0 ), ( a_m = b_u ) and ( u > 0 ) since ( a_m - a_0 = b_u - b_v ) for some ( u, v ). By the uniqueness property, ( v = 0 ). - Hence, ( a_m = b_u ), meaning ({ a_0, a_1, ldots }) is contained in ({ b_0, b_1, ldots }). - Also, since ( a_m - a_0 = a_{f(u)} - a_d ), it implies ( d = 0 ). 10. **Conclusion:** - For any ( n > 0 ), since ( b_n = a_{f(n)} ), the sets ({ a_0, a_1, ldots } ) and ({ b_0, b_1, ldots } equiv) must be equal.

Noting the problem's structure, the store will be chosen along the line connecting the city center and your home. This is because all stores at the same distance from your home have the same transportation cost, and higher distance stores offer lower prices, making further stores preferable. Transportation cost t is given by: [ t = 0.5(Delta s)^2 = 0.5(s_m - s_0)^2 ] 2. **Utility Function Analysis:** Consider the utility function: [ u = v - p - 0.5(s_m - s_0)^2 ] where [ p = p_{max}left(1 - 0.02s_mright) ] and [ p_{max} = 1000 ] Substituting p: [ u = v - 1000(1-0.02s_m) - 0.5(s_m - s_0)^2 ] [ u = v - 1000 + 20s_m - 0.5(s_m - s_0)^2 ] 3. **Finding the Maximum Utility:** This is a quadratic function in terms of s_m: [ u = v - 1000 + 20s_m - 0.5(s_m^2 - 2s_0s_m + s_0^2) ] [ u = v - 1000 + 20s_m - 0.5s_m^2 + s_0s_m - 0.5s_0^2 ] The quadratic term dominates, and the form is: [ u = -0.5s_m^2 + (20 + s_0)s_m + C ] where C includes constants independent of s_m.

We need to show that any initial collection of piles can be transformed into one single pile by combining piles whose sizes are similar. 2. **Consider the Reverse Process**: Instead of starting with one pile and breaking it down, visualize the reverse process. Assume we initially have several individual piles, each containing exactly one stone. The goal is to combine these individual piles into one single pile of size ( n ), where ( n ) is the total number of stones. 3. **Combining Process**: At any step, we can combine two piles of sizes ( x ) and ( y ) (where ( x leq y )) to form a new pile of size ( x + y ). This is valid under the condition that ( x ) and ( y ) are similar sizes, i.e., ( x leq y leq 2x ). 4. **Maintaining Similar Sizes**: - Since we are starting with piles of size 1 (where all piles are similar), assume we always pick the smallest piles to combine. - Each time we combine two piles, say sizes ( x ) and ( y ) (with ( x leq y )), the resulting pile will have size ( x + y ). - The new pile size ( x + y ) must be less than or equal to ( 2y ), hence still meeting the requirement of similar sizes (as ( y leq 2x )). 5. **Inductive Argument**: - We start with ( n ) piles of size 1. - Combining pairs of piles gradually reduces the number of piles while ensuring that all resulting piles maintain the condition of similar sizes. - The process continues, maintaining the invariant that no pile will differ from the other by more than a factor of two. 6. **Reaching the Final Pile**: - This combining will eventually reduce the number of piles until only one pile remains. - Since at every stage the combined pile size respects the similar size condition, the final pile formed is of size ( n ).

To do this, we subtract ( frac{1}{20} ) from both sides of the equation: [ B = frac{1}{15} - frac{1}{20} ] To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60 (the least common multiple of 15 and 20): [ B = frac{4}{60} - frac{3}{60} ] [ B = frac{1}{60} ] So, B's rate is ( frac{1}{60} ) work per day. Now, to find out how many times faster A is than B, we divide A's rate by B's rate: [ text{Times faster} = frac{A}{B} ] [ text{Times faster} = frac{frac{1}{20}}{frac{1}{60}} ] [ text{Times faster} = frac{1}{20} times frac{60}{1} ] [ text{Times faster} = 3 ] Therefore, A is boxed{3} times faster than B."},{"prompt":"ward is taking his kindergarten class to the museum on a school trip.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 36 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 36 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 36000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 10 m/s Now, we know that the train passes the entire platform in 30 seconds. The length of the platform is 180 meters, so the train covers 180 meters in 30 seconds. However, to pass a man standing on the platform, the train only needs to cover its own length, not the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the train as L meters. The train covers the distance of L (its own length) plus 180 meters (the length of the platform) in 30 seconds. Therefore, the distance covered by the train when passing the platform is L + 180 meters. Since the train's speed is constant, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time For the train passing the entire platform: L + 180 = 10 × 30 L + 180 = 300 L = 300 - 180 L = 120 meters Now we know the length of the train is 120 meters. To pass a man standing on the platform, the train only needs to cover its own length.

Since the angle between the vector overrightarrow{a} = (2x+3, x^2-4) and the vector overrightarrow{AB} is 0°, vector overrightarrow{a} must be parallel and in the same direction as vector overrightarrow{AB}. To be parallel and in the same direction, their corresponding components must be proportional and point in the same direction. As the y-component of overrightarrow{AB} is 0, the y-component of overrightarrow{a} must also be 0 for them to be parallel. Therefore, we have the equation: x^2 - 4 = 0 Solving this equation gives us two possible values of x: x = 2 quad text{or} quad x = -2 Now, let's examine each one: 1. When x = 2, we get overrightarrow{a} = (7, 0).

In this case, even though the y-components are both 0, the x-component of overrightarrow{a} is negative while that of overrightarrow{AB} is positive.

This leads to the relationship between a, b, and c in an ellipse, which is b^2 = a^2 - c^2. Substituting the values of a and c, we get b^2 = (2t)^2 - t^2 = 3t^2. Therefore, b = sqrt{3}t. The general equation of an ellipse is frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. Substituting a = 2t and b = sqrt{3}t, we get the equation of ellipse C as frac{x^2}{4t^2} + frac{y^2}{3t^2} = 1. Given that point P(1, frac{3}{2}) lies on the ellipse, we substitute x = 1 and y = frac{3}{2} into the equation of the ellipse to find t: [ frac{1}{4t^2} + frac{frac{9}{4}}{3t^2} = 1 ] Solving this equation, we find that t = 1.

We need to find all positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) such that both ( 3^m + 1 ) and ( 3^n + 1 ) are divisible by ( mn ). 2. First, consider the case where ( m = 1 ) or ( n = 1 ). If ( m = 1 ), then ( 3^m + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 ), and for ( 3^m + 1 ) to be divisible by ( mn ), ( n ) must be a divisor of 4. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. Similarly, if ( n = 1 ), then ( 3^n + 1 = 4 ), and ( m ) must be a divisor of 4. Therefore, the pairs ((m, n)) can be ((1, 1)), ((1, 2)), ((1, 4)), ((2, 1)), and ((4, 1)). 3. Now, consider the case where ( m > 1 ) and ( n > 1 ). We need to show that no such pairs ((m, n)) exist. 4. Note that if ( m ) and ( n ) are both greater than 1, then one of ( m ) or ( n ) must be odd. This is because ( 3^{2k} + 1 equiv 2 pmod{4} ), which means ( 3^{2k} + 1 ) is not divisible by 4, and hence cannot be divisible by ( mn ) if both ( m ) and ( n ) are even. 5. Without loss of generality, assume ( m ) is odd. Since ( m ) is odd, ( 3^m + 1 ) is even. We need ( m ) to divide ( 3^m + 1 ). 6. Let ( p ) be the smallest prime divisor of ( m ). Since ( p ) divides ( m ), it must also divide ( 3^m + 1 ). 7. Since ( p ) is a prime divisor of ( m ), and ( gcd(3, p) = 1 ), by Fermat's Little Theorem, we have ( 3^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). 8. Since ( p ) divides ( 3^m + 1 ), we have ( 3^m equiv -1 pmod{p} ). Squaring both sides, we get ( 3^{2m} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). 9. The order of 3 modulo ( p ), denoted ( text{ord}_p(3) ), must divide both ( 2m ) and ( p-1 ). Since ( m ) is odd, ( text{ord}_p(3) ) must be 2. 10. Therefore, ( 2 ) must divide ( p-1 ), implying ( p equiv 1 pmod{2} ), so ( p ) is odd. 11. Since ( p ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( m ), and ( text{ord}_p(3) = 2 ), we have ( p-1 ) must be even, and ( p-1 ) must have a prime divisor less than ( p ), which is a contradiction because ( p ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( m ). 12.

Since ( a_k ) is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers, we have ( a_2 geq 2 ). According to the problem, every term in the sequence modulo ( a_2 ) will either be congruent to some integer between 0 and ( a_2-1 ). Therefore, we can write: [ a_{n} equiv r_n pmod{a_2} ] where ( r_n ) is the remainder when ( a_n ) is divided by ( a_2 ). 2. **Infinite Subsequence with Same Modulo:** Since ( a_n ) is an infinite strictly increasing sequence, and there are only ( a_2 ) possible remainders (0 through ( a_2-1 )), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one remainder that occurs infinitely often. Let’s denote this specific subsequence by ( { a_{i_k} } ) such that: [ a_{i_k} equiv r pmod{a_2} ] for some fixed remainder ( r ).

Without loss of generality, assume ( m > n ). Then: [ a_{i_m} = a_2 cdot q_m + r ] [ a_{i_n} = a_2 cdot q_n + r ] Subtracting these equations, we get: [ a_{i_m} - r = a_{i_n} - r + a_2 cdot (q_m - q_n) ] Simplifying, it follows: [ a_{i_m} = a_{i_n} + a_2 cdot (q_m - q_n) ] 4. **Conclusion:** Here, we see that ( a_{i_m} ) can indeed be written in the form ( a_{i_m} = x a_{i_n} + y a_2 ) with ( x = 1 ) and ( y = q_m - q_n ) (both ( x ) and ( y ) are positive integers as long as ( q_m > q_n )).

Assuming that the glaze has negligible thickness and is distributed equally on all candies, calculate how many candies Alex will have glazed by the first time all three workers finish glazing their current candy at the same time.","completion":"To solve for the number of candies each worker will glaze before all finish at the same time, we start by finding the surface areas using the formula for the surface area of a sphere, 4pi r^2: - Alex's candy surface area = 4pi cdot 5^2 = 100pi square millimeters. - Mia's candy surface area = 4pi cdot 7^2 = 196pi square millimeters. - Jamie's candy surface area = 4pi cdot 9^2 = 324pi square millimeters. Given the rates of glazing: - Alex's rate = 2 times 100pi = 200pi mm²/hour. - Mia's rate = 1.5 times 196pi = 294pi mm²/hour. - Jamie's rate = 196pi mm²/hour.

This is a fundamental property of triangles: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ ] where (alpha, beta,) and (gamma) are the measures of the three interior angles of the triangle. 2. **Considering a right triangle:** In a right triangle, one of the angles is 90^circ. Let's denote this angle as (alpha).

This triangle can exist. Example: Side lengths (2, 3, 3) form an acute isosceles triangle. - **Right isosceles triangle (b):** In a right isosceles triangle, one angle is 90^circ, and the other two angles are equal: [ beta = gamma = 45^circ ] This condition satisfies (beta + gamma = 90^circ), hence a right isosceles triangle can exist. Example: Side lengths (1, 1, sqrt{2}) form a right isosceles triangle. - **Right obtuse triangle (c):** An obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90^circ. In a right triangle, the sum of the other two angles must be 90^circ. Since an obtuse angle itself is greater than 90^circ, it is impossible to have another 90^circ angle to make the combination fit the criteria of triangle's angle sum. Conclusively, a right obtuse triangle cannot exist. - **Right scalene triangle (d):** In a right scalene triangle, one angle is 90^circ, and the other two are different. This condition meets the triangle angle sum rule. Example: Side lengths (3, 4, 5) form a right scalene triangle. - **Scalene obtuse triangle (e):** An obtuse scalene triangle has one angle greater than 90^circ and no angles or sides equal.

This is because there are (binom{10}{2} = 45) differences ( r_i - r_j ) plus the 10 remainders themselves and 1 for the zero element: [ |S| leq 45 + 10 + 1 = 56. ] 4. **Modulo 100 Saturation**: For ( k geq 2 ), note that [ A_k equiv B_k - B_{k-1} pmod{100}. ] Hence, the differences ( B_k - B_{k-1} ) must cover all possible remainders ( {1, 2, ldots, 100} ) modulo 100. Otherwise, it contradicts the condition of ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{100}} ) being a permutation of ( {1, 2, ldots, 100} ). 5. **Contradiction Resolution**: Suppose only 10 different remainders exist among the set ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{100}} mod 100 ). With the remainders producing differences ( r_i - r_j ) and considering at most 56 elements in ( S ), all numbers ( {1, 2, ldots, 100} ) cannot be covered. This contradicts the property required by the permutation of ( A_i ). 6. **Conclusion**: Since a contradiction exists if there are only 10 remainders, there must be at least 11 different remainders modulo 100 in the set ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{100}} ).

Consider a convex polyhedron and a point ( P ) contained within this polyhedron. Each face ( F ) of the polyhedron has a corresponding orthogonal projection ( P_F ) of ( P ) onto the plane containing that face. 2. We aim to show that there exists at least one face ( F ) such that the projection ( P_F ) is located on the face ( F ) itself, and not just on its extended plane. 3. Let us select the face ( F ) for which the distance ( PP_F ) (i.e., the perpendicular distance from ( P ) to the plane of the face ( F )) is the smallest. If there are multiple faces with the same minimal distance, we can choose any one of them. 4. Now, we assert that the projection ( P_F ) lies within the bounds of the face ( F ) and not on any extension outside the face. 5. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that ( P_F ) is not on the face ( F ) but rather on its extension. In such a scenario, we could draw the segment ([PP_F]). 6. If the segment ([PP_F]) intersects any other face ( F' ) at a point ( P' ), we have the following distances: - ( PP_{F'} ) is the distance from ( P ) to the plane of the face ( F' ). - ( PP' ) is the distance from ( P ) to the intersection point ( P' ). - ( PP_F ) is the distance from ( P ) to the plane of face ( F ). 7. By the geometry of orthogonal projections and intersecting planes, we observe that: [ PP_{F'} < PP' < PP_F ] This results because ( P' ) lies between ( P ) and ( P_F ), thus reducing the distance in any intermediate projection. 8. However, this observation contradicts our original assumption that ( PP_F ) was the smallest possible distance to any plane of the face of the polyhedron. 9. Therefore, our assumption that ( P_F ) lies on the extension of the face ( F ) must be incorrect. # Conclusion Hence, the projection ( P_F ) must lie within the face ( F ) itself and not extend beyond its boundaries.

Let triangle TCF and triangle TDE have a common point (P) (distinct from point (T)) where their circumcircles intersect. 2. Firstly, demonstrate that P, A, E, S are concyclic, and also P, B, F, S are concyclic. 3. Note that points P, E, D, T are concyclic. Therefore, the angle angle PDE = angle PTE and angle PED = 180^circ - angle PTD. 4. Similarly, since points P, F, C, T are concyclic, it follows that angle PCF = angle PTF and angle PFC = 180^circ - angle PTC. 5. Consequently, we have: [ angle PDE = angle PCF ] [ angle PED = angle PFC ] From these, it follows that triangle PDE sim triangle PCF (based on Angle-Angle similarity). 6. Therefore, the sides are proportional: [ frac{PE}{PF} = frac{ED}{FC} ] Along with the initial condition given in the problem: [ frac{AE}{BF} = frac{ED}{FC} ] we derive: [ frac{PE}{PF} = frac{AE}{BF} ] 7. Now, in triangle APE and angle BPF, we know that angle AEP = 180^circ - angle PDE = 180^circ - angle PFC = angle BFP. From this and the previous proportion frac{PE}{PF} = frac{AE}{BF}, it follows that triangle APE sim triangle BPF. 8. If triangle APE sim triangle BPF, then their corresponding angles are equal: [ angle BPF = angle APE ] and their sides are proportional: [ frac{PE}{PF} = frac{PA}{PB} ] 9. From this similarity, we obtain triangle PBA sim triangle PFE due to the Angle-Angle similarity criterion, giving us: [ angle PBA = angle PFE ] Therefore, angle PBS = angle PFS, implying that points P, B, F, S are concyclic. 10. Proceeding further from triangle PBA sim triangle PFE, we derive that: [ angle PAB = angle PEF ] Hence, angle PAS = 180^circ - angle PAB = 180^circ - angle PEF = angle PES, showing that points P, A, E, S are concyclic. 11.

Furthermore, there was another knight C who defeated both A and B. 3. **Introducing More Defeats:** Since knight B was defeated by knight C, there must be another knight, say D, who defeated both A and C (because B cannot defeat both A and C given that B was defeated by C). 4. **Defining the General Pattern:** Since A is arbitrary and could be any knight, each knight must have been defeated by at least three other knights. This means every knight has at least 3 defeats. 5. **Establishing Mathematical Conditions:** Let k represent the number of knights participating in the tournament.

We know that the rational numbers are countable. 2. **Constructing Sequences**: For each positive real number in the interval (0, 1), consider sequences of rationals that converge to these real numbers. Let's denote a real number in (0, 1) by r in (0, 1) . For each r , we can find a sequence {q_n}_{n=1}^{infty} of rational numbers whereby lim_{n to infty} q_n = r. 3. **Forming Subsets of Rational Numbers**: Each sequence {q_n} can be thought of as a subset of the rational numbers mathbb{Q} . Thus, for each irrational r in (0, 1), we can assign a distinct subset of mathbb{Q} . Since the interval (0, 1) of real numbers is uncountable, we have constructed an uncountable collection of these sequences (or subsets of mathbb{Q} ). 4. **Checking the Intersection Property**: By construction, any two distinct sequences {q_n} and {q_n'} that converge to different real numbers r neq r' have at most finitely many common points, because rational numbers form a dense and discrete set, and sequences converging to different limits can only intersect finitely many times. 5. **Mapping to Subsets of Positive Integers**: To construct corresponding subsets of the positive integers, we can use a bijection f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{Q} between the set of positive integers mathbb{N} and the rationals mathbb{Q}. Specifically, if mathbb{Q} = {q_1, q_2, q_3, ldots } , we can map each rational number q_i to a unique positive integer i . Then, each sequence {q_n} can be translated into a sequence {f^{-1}(q_n)}, which will be a subset of positive integers. 6. **Ensuring the Intersection Property**: Since the mapping f is a bijection, the intersection properties of the subsets in mathbb{N} will mirror those in mathbb{Q}, implying that any two distinct subsets of mathbb{N} obtained this way will still intersect in only finitely many elements. # Conclusion: Therefore, we can conclude that there indeed exists an uncountable set of subsets of the positive integers, where any two distinct subsets have a finite intersection.

What percentage of children have red flags?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of flags as F, which is an even number. Let's also denote the total number of children as C. Each child picks up two flags, so the total number of flags is also twice the number of children, i.e., F = 2C. Now, we are given that 60% of the children have blue flags, and 10% of the children have both blue and red flags. This means that 60% - 10% = 50% of the children have only blue flags. Since each child has two flags, the 10% of children who have both colors must have one blue flag and one red flag each. Therefore, these children account for 10% of the blue flags and 10% of the red flags. Now, we need to find the percentage of children who have red flags. We know that 50% have only blue flags, and 10% have both, which means that 40% of the children must have only red flags because all flags are used up and each child has two flags. So, the percentage of children who have red flags is the sum of those who have only red flags and those who have both colors, which is 40% (only red) + 10% (both) = 50%.

Next, choose a digit ( d_1 ) such that ( d_1 + c_1 ) either equals 1 or 11. Pick a digit ( b_1 ) such that ( Ab_1 ) ends with ( d_1 ). Therefore, ( A(10b_1 + b_0) ) ends with 11. Suppose the last three digits of ( A(10b_1 + b_0) ) are ( c_2 11 ). 5. Continue this process: - Choose a digit ( d_2 ) such that ( d_2 + c_2 ) either equals 1 or 11.

T = (2/5)P (since 2/5 of the people are riding tricycles) We also know that the total number of wheels is 96, so we can write another equation: 3. 2B + 3T = 96 (since each bicycle has 2 wheels and each tricycle has 3 wheels) Now we can substitute the expressions for B and T from equations 1 and 2 into equation 3: 2 * (3/5)P + 3 * (2/5)P = 96 Simplifying the equation, we get: (6/5)P + (6/5)P = 96 Combining like terms, we have: (12/5)P = 96 Now, to find P, we divide both sides of the equation by (12/5): P = 96 / (12/5) P = 96 * (5/12) P = 8 * 5 P = 40 So, there are boxed{40} people in the race."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],R={key:0},W={key:1};function M(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",L,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
