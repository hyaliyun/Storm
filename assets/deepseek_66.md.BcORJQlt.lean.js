( n ) points are colored blue and ( n ) points are colored red. We are to show that it is possible to draw ( n ) non-intersecting segments such that each segment connects a blue point to a red point, and each point is used exactly once. Let's explore this via two distinct solution approaches: # 1: Strong Induction Using Convex Hull 1. **Base Case**: For ( n=1 ), there are two points: one blue and one red. The only possible segment connects these two points. This trivially satisfies the conditions. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for ( k leq n-1 ), the statement holds true. We consider the case of ( n ). 3. **Convex Hull Analysis**: 1. Construct the convex hull of the ( 2n ) points. This convex hull will include some of these points on its boundary. 2. **Case 1: Convex Hull Contains Points of Both Colors**: - Suppose the convex hull includes points ( A ) (blue) and ( B ) (red) that are consecutive on the hull. - Remove ( A ) and ( B ) and consider the remaining ( 2(n-1) ) points. By the induction hypothesis, we can pair and connect these remaining points with non-intersecting segments such that each pair is a segment connecting a blue point and a red point. - Adding the segment ( AB ) to this configuration ensures all ( 2n ) points are used without creating any intersections, due to the properties of convex hulls. 3. **Case 2: Convex Hull Contains Points of One Color Only**: - Assume the convex hull is composed only of blue points. Rotate the plane slightly to ensure all points have unique x-coordinates without loss of generality. - The leftmost and rightmost points on the hull will be blue. Now, sweep a vertical line (d) from left to right across the plane. - As ( d ) moves: - Initially, there are more blue points to the left of ( d ) than red points. - Finally, there are more red points to the right. By the intermediate value theorem, there exists a position of ( d ) where the number of blue points equals the number of red points on each side. - Applying the induction hypothesis to each side, connect the points without intersections on either side of ( d ). Together this forms the desired non-intersecting segments. Following this inductive reasoning, we establish that any arrangement of ( 2n ) points with ( n ) blue and ( n ) red points can be paired with non-intersecting segments, completing the induction step. # 2: Minimizing Total Segment Length 1. **Definitions**: - Consider all possible ways to pair and connect the points such that each pair includes one blue point and one red point. - Let ( mathcal{T} ) be one such configuration of ( n ) segments. 2. **Minimal Length Configuration**: - Define ( p(mathcal{T}) ) as the sum of the lengths of the segments in ( mathcal{T} ). - Since the number of possible configurations is finite, there exists a configuration ( mathcal{T}_0 ) that minimizes ( p(mathcal{T}) ). 3. **Intersections in the Minimal Configuration**: - Assume, for contradiction, that ( mathcal{T}_0 ) has intersecting segments. Let these segments be ( [B_1, R_1] ) and ( [B_2, R_2] ) where ( B_i ) are blue points and ( R_i ) are red points. - Redraw these segments as ( [B_1, R_2] ) and ( [B_2, R_1] ). By the triangle inequality, the sum of the lengths of the new segments is strictly less than the sum of the original intersecting segments. - This implies ( p(mathcal{T}_0) ) was not minimal, contradicting our assumption. Thus, ( mathcal{T}_0 ) does not have intersecting segments, ensuring the existence of a non-intersecting configuration.

When they work together for the first hour, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: Avery's rate + Tom's rate = 1/2 + 1/4 = 2/4 + 1/4 = 3/4 wall per hour. In the first hour, they complete 3/4 of the wall together. This means that 1/4 of the wall is left to be completed. Now, Avery leaves, and Tom continues to work on his own. Since Tom's rate is 1/4 wall per hour, he will need to work for the amount of time it takes to complete the remaining 1/4 of the wall. To find out how long it will take Tom to complete the remaining 1/4 of the wall on his own, we divide the remaining work by Tom's rate: Time = Remaining work / Tom's rate = 1/4 wall / (1/4 wall per hour) = 1 hour.

This gives us: [ d = frac{|2k+1|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} ] 2. **Radius of the Circle (R):** The equation of the circle {C}_{2}: (x-2)^2+y^2=5 implies that its radius R is the square root of 5, or: [ R = sqrt{5} ] 3. **Chord Length Relation:** Given that the chord length |AB|=4, we can use the relation between the chord length, the radius of the circle, and the distance from the center to the line to find: [ |AB| = 2sqrt{R^2 - d^2} ] Substituting the given values and the expressions for R and d, we have: [ 4 = 2sqrt{5 - frac{(2k+1)^2}{1+k^2}} ] 4. **Solving for k:** Squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root and solving for k, we find: [ 4^2 = 4^2left(5 - frac{(2k+1)^2}{1+k^2}right) ] Simplifying this equation leads to two possible solutions for k: [ k = 0 quad text{or} quad k = -frac{4}{3} ] Therefore, the values of k for which the line l_{1} intersects the circle {C}_{2} and the chord length |AB|=4 are: [ boxed{k = 0 quad text{or} quad k = -frac{4}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let ( p_1 = 2 ), and for ( n geq 1 ), let ( p_{n+1} ) denote the smallest prime divisor of the number ( n p_1^{1!} p_2^{2!} ldots p_n^{n!} + 1 ). Prove that every prime number appears in the sequence ( p_1, p_2, ldots ).","completion":"1. First, let's define ( A_{n+1} ) as follows: [ A_{n+1} = n cdot p_1^{1!} cdot p_2^{2!} cdot ldots cdot p_n^{n!} + 1 ] 2. Begin with the assumption that every prime number appears at most once in the sequence ( p_1, p_2, ldots ). Suppose there are two indices ( i < j ) where ( p_i = p_j ). This would imply that ( p_j ) divides ( (j-1) cdot p_1^{1!} cdot p_2^{2!} cdot ldots cdot p_{j-1}^{(j-1)!} ), since ( p_j = p_i ) and ( p_j ) is part of the product's factors. However, adding one to this product ensures ( p_j ) does not divide ( A_j ), creating a contradiction to the definition of the sequence. Thus, each prime can appear at most once. 3. Next, assume there's a prime ( p ) that does not appear in the sequence. We need to demonstrate that infinitely many members of the ( A_n ) series are divisible by ( p ). 4. Let: [ L = p_1^{1!} cdot p_2^{2!} cdot ldots cdot p_{p-2}^{(p-2)!} ] Since none of these ( p_i )'s equal ( p ) (given ( p ) is not in the sequence), ( L ) is not divisible by ( p ). 5. For ( n > p-1 ), we express ( A_{n+1} ): [ A_{n+1} = n cdot L cdot p_{p-1}^{p-1!} cdot p_p^{p!} cdot ldots cdot p_n^{n!} + 1 ] 6. Note here that ( p_k ) for ( k > p-2 ) is not divisible by ( p ). Using Fermat's Little Theorem, ( p_k^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Since ( k! ) is divisible by ( (p-1) ), we deduce: [ p_k^{k!} equiv ( p_k^{p-1} )^b equiv 1^b equiv 1 pmod{p} ] 7. This simplifies our previous expression: [ A_{n+1} equiv n cdot L + 1 pmod{p} ] 8. Now, if ( n cdot L equiv -1 pmod{p} ) has a solution, let ( n_0 ) satisfy this condition. Consequently, for any ( t geq 0 ): [ A_{tp+n_0+1} equiv (tp + n_0) cdot L + 1 equiv n_0 cdot L + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] 9. For ( t ) sufficiently large to ensure ( tp + n_0 > p-1 ), we verify ( A_n ) has infinitely many terms divisible by ( p ). 10. Lastly, ensure there is a solution. Considering: [ n cdot L equiv -1 pmod{p} ] Since ( p ) is prime and ( L ) is not divisible by ( p ), ( L ) and ( p ) are relatively prime. Thus, by the properties of modular arithmetic, the sequence ( 0, L, 2L, ldots, (p-1)L ) must cover all residues modulo ( p ), ensuring one of these residues must be (-1).

The probability of hitting a target with a single shot is ( p ), and the probability of missing a target with a single shot is ( 1-p ). 2. Let ( X ) represent a successful hit with a single shot and ( Y ) represent a failure that requires a second shot. We need the exact sequence where: - Three targets are hit in the first shot itself. - Two targets require two shots each (total four shots). The probability of this specific sequence occurring follows the Binomial distribution and can be calculated as follows: [ P(text{exactly 3 hits in first shot out of 5 trials}) = binom{5}{3} p^3 (1-p)^2 ] The binomial coefficient ( binom{5}{3} ) accounts for the different ways to choose 3 successful hits out of 5 targets. Now compute the binomial coefficient and the probability: [ binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3! cdot (5-3)!} = frac{5 cdot 4}{2 cdot 1} = 10 ] Thus, the required probability is: [ P = 10 cdot p^3 cdot (1-p)^2 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{10 p^3 (1-p)^2} ] **Part (b):** To calculate the mathematical expectation of the number of targets hit when there are nine targets and the cruiser has ten rockets, we add one more fictitious target, making a total of ten targets. 1.

The expected number of hits for ten targets is: [ mathrm{E}[Y] = 10p ] Let ( I ) be a random variable such that: - ( I = 1 ) if the cruiser hits all ten targets. - ( I = 0 ) otherwise. ( I ) follows a Bernoulli distribution with probability ( p^{10} ) because the cruiser will only hit the tenth fictitious target if it successfully hits the first nine real targets using nine rockets and has one rocket left for the fictitious target. Now the expectation ( mathrm{E}[I] ) is: [ mathrm{E}[I] = 1 cdot p^{10} + 0 cdot (1 - p^{10}) = p^{10} ] Therefore, the expected number of successful real hits is: [ mathrm{E}[X] = mathrm{E}[Y] - mathrm{E}[I] = 10p - p^{10} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{10p - p^{10}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function y=x^2+2(a2)x+5 is increasing in the interval (4, +infty), find the range of possible values for a.","completion":"To ensure that the function y=x^2+2(a-2)x+5 is increasing in the interval (4, +infty), we first need to determine the axis of symmetry of the parabola defined by the function.

In our case, the function can be rewritten as: y=x^2+2(a-2)x+5, which compares to the standard form ax^2 + bx + c, where a=1 and b=2(a-2). The axis of symmetry is therefore: x = -frac{2(a-2)}{2cdot 1} = 2-a Since we want the function to be increasing beyond x=4, the axis of symmetry must be to the left of 4 on the x-axis.

So, if she worked 40 hours or less, her pay would be ( 10 times H ). But since she made 700, which is more than ( 10 times 40 = 400 ), we know she worked overtime.

We aim to prove that there exists a set ( S ) which maximizes the sum of the reciprocals of its elements. 2. **Partial Order on ( mathbb{Z}^n ):** Consider the set of all ( n )-tuples of distinct positive integers, denoted by ( mathbb{Z}^n ). We define a partial order on ( mathbb{Z}^n ) by saying that ( mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ) is below ( mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n) ) if ( a_i leq b_i ) for all ( i ). 3. **Sum of Reciprocals and Partial Order:** If ( mathbf{a} ) is below ( mathbf{b} ) in this partial order, then the sum of the reciprocals of the elements of ( mathbf{a} ) is larger than the sum of the reciprocals of the elements of ( mathbf{b} ). This is because for each ( i ), ( frac{1}{a_i} geq frac{1}{b_i} ). 4. **Existence of a Maximal Element:** Since we are dealing with a finite set of ( n )-tuples of distinct positive integers, the set is finite. In any finite partially ordered set, there exists at least one maximal element.

As lg(-x) isn't defined for negative x in real numbers, and considering the context that f(x) is an odd function defined for all x in its domain, we infer that f(x) must take into account the absolute value inside the logarithm to remain well-defined for -x > 0.

If a number ( t ) is coprime with 10000, and numbers ( p ) and ( q ) leave different remainders when divided by 10000, then ( pt ) and ( qt ) also leave different remainders when divided by 10000. b. If a number ( a ) is coprime with 10000, there exists some number ( a' ) (also coprime with 10000) such that ( aa' equiv 1 mod 10000 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume the case where we can form sums of ( n-1 ) numbers that give at least ( n-1 ) different remainders modulo 10000 (each remainder representing a distinct residue class). 3. **Base Case ( n = 1 )**: The base case is trivial. If ( n = 1 ), we only have one number, which leaves one remainder by itself - the number itself. Hence, the base case holds as there's exactly one distinct remainder. 4. **Induction Step**: Assuming the hypothesis is true for ( n-1 ), we need to prove it remains true for ( n ) numbers. - Take ( n-1 ) residues ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} ) formed by ( n-1 ) numbers. - Introduce a new number ( a ), which is coprime with 10000. Without loss of generality, consider this number can be ( a = 1 ). To generalize, if ( a neq 1 ), use the multiplicative inverse ( a' ) (such that ( aa' equiv 1 mod 10000 )), the properties remain invariant upon scaling by ( a' ). - With the new set of numbers, we can form sums ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{n-1} ) and consider the sums when including this new number ( a ). 5. **Calculation of New Residues**: - The sums ( S_i ) can be augmented by ( a ). - Since we assume ( a = 1 ), consider adding 1 to each ( b_i ). - If ( b_1, ldots, b_{n-1} ) are distinct, adding ( a ) results in new distinct residues, specifically ( b_1+1, ldots, b_{n-1}+1 mod 10000 ). 6. **Adjusting for Gaps**: If there's some ( k < n-1 ) such that ( b_{k+1} - b_k geq 2 ), then ( S_k + a ) gives a new residue ( b_k + 1 ). Thus, every time we introduce a new number, we either shift all residues up by 1 without gaps or find new gaps created by the new number, ensuring all residues are unique. By repeatedly applying this process, the collection of sums encapsulates every possible residue class by modulo 10000. # Conclusion By induction, we have shown that for any set of ( n ) numbers, we can always choose a subset such that their sum leaves any specified remainder when divided by 10000.

Let ( P(X) ) and ( Q(X) ) be monic irreducible polynomials with rational coefficients, and let (alpha) and (beta) be roots of ( P(X) ) and ( Q(X) ) respectively, such that (alpha + beta) is rational. Define ( r = alpha + beta ). Since ( r in mathbb{Q} ), we have (beta = r - alpha). 2. Since (beta = r - alpha), we have (mathbb{Q}(beta) = mathbb{Q}(r - alpha) = mathbb{Q}(alpha)). 3. The minimal polynomial of (alpha) over (mathbb{Q}) is (P(X)), as (alpha) is a root of (P(X)) and (P(X)) is irreducible. Therefore, there exists a (mathbb{Q})-algebra isomorphism (mathbb{Q}[X] / (P(X)) to mathbb{Q}(alpha)) which maps (overline{R}) to (R(alpha)) for every polynomial (R in mathbb{Q}[X]). 4. This isomorphism maps the residue class (overline{Q(r - X)}) to (Q(r - alpha) = Q(beta) = 0). Hence, the residue class (overline{Q(r - X)}) must be (0) in (mathbb{Q}[X] / (P(X))). This implies that (Q(r - X) equiv 0 mod (P(X))), or equivalently, (P(X) mid Q(r - X)). 5. Since (P(X)) divides (Q(r - X)), we have (deg P leq deg(Q(r - X)) = deg Q). Similarly, by considering the polynomial (P(r - X)), we get (deg Q leq deg P). Combining these inequalities, we obtain (deg P = deg Q). 6. Since (deg P = deg Q), and both (P(X)) and (Q(X)) are monic, the polynomial (Q(r - X)) must be of the form (sP(X)) for some scalar (s in mathbb{Q}). 7. Comparing the leading coefficients of (Q(r - X)) and (sP(X)), and noting that both (P(X)) and (Q(X)) are monic, we find that (s = pm 1). Therefore, (Q(r - X) = pm P(X)). 8. Evaluating at (X = frac{r}{2}), we get (Qleft(frac{r}{2}right) = pm Pleft(frac{r}{2}right)). Squaring both sides, we obtain (Qleft(frac{r}{2}right)^2 = Pleft(frac{r}{2}right)^2). 9.

Let's denote these people as ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ), where person ( P_i ) is missing sticker ( i ). **Step 3:** Consider any pair of friends ((P_i, P_j)).

Since ( i neq j ) for any ( i ) and ( j ), every pair ( (P_i, P_j) ) is complete if they sit at the same table. **Conclusion:** Therefore, to avoid any complete pairs, each one of the ( n ) friends must sit at a different table.

But by the design of our distribution, if both ( P_a ) and ( P_b ) were at table ( T_i ), it would imply they both lack sticker ( i ), contradicting the condition that any two people cannot both lack the same sticker if they complete each other. **Conclusion:** Thus, by assigning friends based on missing stickers to ( n ) tables, we ensure that no table contains a complete meal.

We'll consider two cases based on the value of x: 1. **Case 1: x leq 0** In this case, the expression x|x| becomes -x^2 because the absolute value of a non-positive number is its negation. Thus, the inequality becomes: -x^2 < 2 Multiplying both sides by -1 (and remembering to flip the inequality sign) gives: x^2 > -2 Since x^2 is always non-negative, and -2 is negative, this inequality is always true for any real number x. Therefore, all x leq 0 satisfy the inequality x|x| < 2. 2. **Case 2: x > 0** Here, x|x| simplifies to x^2 because the absolute value of a positive number is itself. Thus, the inequality becomes: x^2 < 2 To find the solution, we solve for x: - sqrt{2} < x < sqrt{2} However, since we're in the case where x > 0, the solution set narrows down to: 0 < x < sqrt{2} Combining both cases, the solution set for x|x| < 2 is all x such that x < sqrt{2}. Comparing this to the statement \\"x < 1\\", we see that any x < 1 will indeed satisfy x|x| < 2, but not all solutions of x|x| < 2 are less than 1 (since sqrt{2} > 1).

The height is given as 25 cm, and the longer parallel side is 20 cm. If we draw a right triangle using the height and the slanted non-parallel side, the angle of 60° is opposite the height. Using trigonometry, we can find the length of the slanted side (hypotenuse) using the sine function: sin(60°) = opposite/hypotenuse sin(60°) = 25 cm / hypotenuse The sine of 60° is √3/2, so: √3/2 = 25 cm / hypotenuse hypotenuse = 25 cm / (√3/2) hypotenuse = (25 cm * 2) / √3 hypotenuse ≈ 50 cm / 1.732 hypotenuse ≈ 28.87 cm This calculation gives us the length of the slanted side, which is not directly needed to calculate the area of the trapezium but confirms that the height is consistent with the given angle and the length of the longer parallel side.

Through our calculations, we must find their speeds and the total distance of the track. # Steps: 1. **Let Initial Variables:** - Let alpha cover the half circle in x seconds. - Let beta cover the half circle in y seconds. - Since the runners run at uniform speeds, any distance runner alpha covers is frac{x}{y} times the time beta would take to cover the same distance. 2. **Time Calculations:** - beta covers the arc widehat{SQ} in frac{17}{15} seconds. - alpha covers the same distance in frac{17}{15} cdot frac{x}{y} seconds. - alpha and beta positions are mirror images after further frac{17}{15} cdot frac{x}{y} seconds for alpha and frac{17}{15} seconds for beta. - At this point, alpha needs x seconds to complete the half circle from Q to P while beta needs y seconds to complete the half circle from P to Q. 3. **Additional Distances and Times:** - Sum of the times alpha needs to complete the arcs widehat{QS'}, widehat{S'T}, and widehat{TP} is: [ frac{17}{15} cdot frac{x}{y} + frac{17}{15} + frac{208}{15} ] 4. **Relation of x and y:** - Equating the total times: [ x = frac{17}{15} cdot frac{x}{y} + frac{17}{15} + frac{208}{15} ] - For beta: [ y = x + frac{17}{15} cdot frac{x}{y} + frac{17}{15} ] 5. **Solve for x and y:** - Subtracting these equations: [ y - x = x - frac{208}{15} ] [ 15y = 30x - 208 ] Solving, substitute 15y into the first equation: [ x = frac{17x}{30x - 208} + 15 ] [ 30x^2 - 675x + 3120 = 0 ] 6. **Solving the quadratic equation:** - Simplify by dividing by 15: [ 2x^2 - 45x + 208 = 0 ] - Solve: [ x_1 = 16, quad x_2 = 6.5 quad (text{discard as it gives negative value}) ] - Thus, x = 16 sec, and y = frac{272}{15} = 18 frac{2}{15} sec. 7. **Determine beta's speed:** - beta covers 16 meters in frac{32}{15} seconds: [ v_{beta} = frac{16 cdot 15}{32} = frac{15}{2} = 7.5 text{ m/sec} ] 8. **Determine alpha's speed:** - alpha's speed using beta's speed: [ v_{alpha} = v_{beta} cdot frac{y}{x} = frac{15}{2} cdot frac{272}{16 cdot 15} = 8.5 text{ m/sec} ] 9. **Calculate total distance of the track:** - Half track s can be calculated: [ s = 16 cdot frac{272}{32} ] - The full track length is: [ 2s = 2 cdot 16 cdot frac{272}{32} = 272 text{ meters} ] # Conclusion: The speeds and distance of the track are: [ v_{alpha} = 8.5 text{ m/sec} ] [ v_{beta} = 7.5 text{ m/sec} ] [ text{Track length} = 272 text{ meters} ] boxed{272 text{ meters}}"},{"prompt":"a set consisting of n elements, 2^{n1} subsets are chosen, each of which has a common element with every other subset taken three at a time. Prove that all these subsets have a common element.","completion":"To prove that all subsets chosen have a common element given that any three of them share a common element, we proceed as follows: 1. **Setting the Stage:** Let ( A ) be a set with ( n ) elements. There are ( 2^n ) different subsets of ( A ), including the empty set and ( A ) itself. 2. **Selected Subsets:** According to the problem, there are ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets chosen from ( A ). These subsets satisfy the condition that every three of them have a common element. 3. **Complementation Principle:** For every subset ( B ), denote its complement by ( bar{B} ). Since we have ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets chosen from the ( 2^n ) possibilities, it implies that exactly half of all possible subsets are chosen. This is important because it tells us about the parity and distribution of these subsets. 4. **Pairs of Subsets:** From the ( 2^{n-1} ) chosen subsets, observe that for each subset ( B ), either ( B ) or its complement ( bar{B} ) is chosen, but not both. This is because if both ( B ) and ( bar{B} ) were chosen, they might not intersect in a way that satisfies the problem conditions. 5. **Intersection Property:** Given subsets ( B ) and ( C ) are chosen, the intersection ( D = B cap C ) must also be one of the chosen subsets. Why? - If ( bar{D} ) (the complement of ( D )) were also chosen, then ( B cap C cap bar{D} = B cap C cap (A setminus D) = B cap C setminus D ) would be empty, which contradicts the condition that every three chosen subsets have a common element. 6. **Inductive Step:** By induction, we can extend this intersection property to any number ( k ) of subsets: - Base Case: For ( k = 1 ), the subset itself is trivially chosen. - Inductive Step: Assume that for ( k ) subsets ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k ), the intersection ( B_1 cap B_2 cap ldots cap B_k ) is also chosen. Then for ( k+1 ) subsets, consider ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k, B_{k+1} ). Their intersection ( B_1 cap B_2 cap ldots cap B_k cap B_{k+1} ) is chosen by the given property. 7. **Conclusion:** The intersection of all ( 2^{n-1} ) chosen subsets must also be a subset of ( A ). Given that these subsets intersect pairwise and triply, their overall intersection is non-empty. Hence, there exists at least one element common to all ( 2^{n-1} ) chosen subsets. Thus, we have proved that all ( 2^{n-1} ) chosen subsets must share at least one common element. [blacksquare]"},{"prompt":"Given that y is a direct proportion function of 2x+3, and when x=1, y=5.

Conclusion: If we initially have more than 2 odd numbers, Sara can always reduce them to an even count that eventually reduces to zero. Hence, Paul can only force a win if there are exactly 1 or 2 odd numbers starting. 5. **Probabilistic Calculation**: - Given (2021) integers sampled uniformly at random from ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 2021}): - The probability of having exactly (k) odd numbers translates to ((frac{1}{2})^{2021}).

This results in three circles, each with radius r, which touch the sides of an equilateral triangle with side length a and touch each other.

The side length of the base of the regular triangular pyramid OO_1O_2O_3 is equal to 2r, and the slant height of the pyramid is r + R.

What is the sum of all values of f(n) that are prime numbers?","completion":"To solve for the sum of all values of f(n) = n^4 - 360n^2 + 400 that are prime numbers, we follow these steps: 1. **Express f(n) in terms of another function g(x)**: We notice that f(x) can be represented as g(x^2) where g(x) = x^2 - 360x + 400. This gives us f(x) = g(x^2) = (x^2)^2 - 360(x^2) + 400. 2. **Find the roots of g(x)**: The roots of g(x) are found using the quadratic formula: begin{align*} x_{1,2} &= frac{360 pm sqrt{360^2 - 4 cdot 400}}{2} &= 180 pm 80sqrt{5} end{align*} This allows us to express g(x) as (x - 180 - 80sqrt{5})(x - 180 + 80sqrt{5}). 3. **Factor f(x) using the roots of g(x)**: Since f(x) = g(x^2), we can write f(x) as: begin{align*} f(x) = (x^2 - 180 - 80sqrt{5})(x^2 - 180 + 80sqrt{5}) end{align*} 4. **Express constants as squares**: We aim to express 180 pm 80sqrt{5} as squares. We find a and b such that (a+bsqrt{5})^2 = 180 + 80sqrt{5}, leading to a=10 and b=4. Thus, 180 + 80sqrt{5} = (10 + 4sqrt{5})^2 and 180 - 80sqrt{5} = (10 - 4sqrt{5})^2. 5. **Complete factorization of f(x)**: With the above, we can write: begin{align*} f(x) = (x - 10 - 4sqrt{5})(x + 10 + 4sqrt{5})(x - 10 + 4sqrt{5})(x + 10 - 4sqrt{5}) end{align*} 6. **Combine factors to eliminate square roots**: We combine the factors to get rid of the square roots, resulting in: begin{align*} f(x) &= (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20) end{align*} 7. **Analyze the factorization for prime values**: For x geq 20, both terms are positive and larger than one, so f(x) is not prime. For 1 < x < 19, the second factor is positive and the first one is negative, so f(x) is not prime. The remaining cases are x=1 and x=19, where f(x) is prime. 8. **Calculate the sum of prime values**: The sum of prime values is f(1) + f(19) = 41 + 761.

Therefore, the coefficient of the 6th term is calculated as follows: [ {C}_{10}^{5}cdot 2^{5}cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^{5} = frac{10!}{5!5!}cdot 32 cdot frac{1}{32} = frac{10cdot9cdot8cdot7cdot6}{5cdot4cdot3cdot2cdot1} = 252. ] Therefore, the coefficient of the term with the largest binomial coefficient in the expansion of left(frac{1}{2}+2xright)^{10} is boxed{252}."},{"prompt":"A river is some meters deep and 75 m wide is flowing at the rate of 4 kmph. The amount of water that runs into the sea per minute is 35000 cubic meters. How deep is the river?","completion":"To find the depth of the river, we need to calculate the volume of water flowing into the sea per minute and then use the width of the river and the flow rate to find the depth. First, let's convert the flow rate from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per minute (m/min) since the volume is given in cubic meters per minute. Flow rate = 4 kmph 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 60 minutes Flow rate in m/min = 4 kmph * (1000 m/km) / (60 min/hour) Flow rate in m/min = 4000 m/hour / 60 min/hour Flow rate in m/min = 66.67 m/min Now we have the flow rate in meters per minute and the width of the river. We can calculate the cross-sectional area of the river that the water flows through per minute. Volume per minute = Cross-sectional area * Flow rate per minute Given that the volume per minute is 35000 cubic meters, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the cross-sectional area: Cross-sectional area = Volume per minute / Flow rate per minute Cross-sectional area = 35000 m³/min / 66.67 m/min Cross-sectional area ≈ 525 m² The cross-sectional area of the river is the product of its width and depth. We know the width is 75 meters, so we can solve for the depth: Cross-sectional area = Width * Depth Depth = Cross-sectional area / Width Depth = 525 m² / 75 m Depth = 7 m Therefore, the river is boxed{7} meters deep."},{"prompt":"Prove that for any natural number ( k > 1 ), there exists a power of 2 such that in its last ( k ) digits, at least half are 9.

We can express the combined work rate of A and B as the sum of their individual work rates: A + B = 1/6 We already know A's work rate: A = 1/14 Now we can solve for B's work rate by substituting A's work rate into the combined work rate equation: 1/14 + B = 1/6 To find B, we subtract A's work rate from the combined work rate: B = 1/6 - 1/14 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is the least common multiple of 6 and 14. The least common multiple of 6 and 14 is 42. So we convert the fractions to have the same denominator: B = (7/42) - (3/42) Now we can subtract the numerators: B = (7 - 3)/42 B = 4/42 We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: B = (4 ÷ 2) / (42 ÷ 2) B = 2/21 So B's work rate is 2/21 of the job per day. To find out how many days B alone would take to complete the job, we take the reciprocal of B's work rate: Days for B to complete the job = 1 / (B's work rate) Days for B to complete the job = 1 / (2/21) Days for B to complete the job = 21/2 Days for B to complete the job = 10.5 Therefore, B alone can complete the work in boxed{10.5} days."},{"prompt":"Given a quadratic equation x^{2}(2k+1)x+k^{2}+k=0.

Since: [ y = s - x ] We have: [ x^n + y^n = x^n + (s - x)^n ] Using the binomial expansion for (s - x)^n and simplifying modulo s^3, we get: [ x^n + (s - x)^n equiv x^n + left( -x + s right)^n equiv x^n + left( -1 right)^n x^n + C_n^1 s left( -x right)^{n-1} + cdots pmod{s^3} ] Since n is odd, (-1)^n = -1, and higher-order terms modulo s^3 vanish. So: [ x^n + y^n equiv C_n^1 s left( -x right)^{n-1} pmod{s^3} ] Evaluating the binomial coefficient: [ C_n^1 = n ] We then have: [ x^n + y^n equiv -n s x^{n-1} pmod{s^3} ] Given that x^n + y^n is a multiple of s^3, it follows: [ -n s x^{n-1} = k s^3 quad text{for some integer } k ] Simplifying, we determine: [ n x^{n-1} = k s^2 ] Since x and s are coprime, n must be divisible by s. Without loss of generality, assume: [ n = ms ] For some integer m. Expanding: [ -frac{1}{2} n(n-1) s x^{n-2} = C ] where C must also be a multiple of s^2. This leads to n being a multiple of s^2, contradicting the initial condition that n has no perfect square factors greater than 1. 6. **Final Conclusion**: Applying both cases, we prove that our initial assumption leads to contradictions. Thus, there are no coprime integers x and y for which x^n + y^n is a multiple of (x + y)^3.

In each number, the first digit was swapped with the last digit. What is the sum of the new numbers?","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the properties of the given numbers and the transformations applied to them. 1. **Determine Sum of Last Digits:** Since we are given three three-digit numbers where all digits from 1 to 9 are used exactly once in the sum of these three numbers, we need to determine the sum of the last digits. The possible sums for different combinations of the last digits are: [ {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} ] Summing each combination of last digits: [ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ] [ 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 ] [ 7 + 8 + 9 = 24 ] However, the sum of the last digits of the three numbers cannot be 5 or 25 since there are no combinations of distinct digits from 1 to 9 that sum to 5 or 25. Hence, the only possible sum is 15. 2. **Determine Sum of Middle Digits:** Similarly, since the digits 1 through 9 are all used once among these numbers, the sum of the last digits being 15 implies the sum of the middle digits and the first digits must also be 15 each, as they all need to be distinctive sets containing digits from 1 to 9. 3. **Reversing the Digits:** Given that reversing the digits of each of the original numbers involves the switching of first and last digits: Let's denote the three numbers by (ABC), (DEF), and (GHI). After transforming the digits, they become (CBA), (FED), and (IHG) respectively. 4. **Calculating Sum of New Numbers:** Let’s consider the contribution of each place value in the resulting sums: - The first digits (C, F, I) originally contributed as the smallest place value (units), but they now contribute as hundreds. - The last digits (A, D, G) now contribute as units instead of hundreds. - Middle digits (B, E, H) stay as tens.

We need to show (a_{n+1}) is divisible by (2^n). Using the recurrence relation: [ a_{n+1} = 2005 b_n + a_n ] By the induction hypothesis, (a_n) is divisible by (2^{n-1}).

This forms a geometric sequence where the first term (a_1) is 1, and the common ratio (r) is 2. 2. **Calculate the Total Number of Grains**: The total number of grains on a chessboard with 64 squares can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence: S_n = frac{a_1(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}. Plugging in the values, we get: [ S_{64} = frac{1 cdot (2^{64} - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^{64} - 1 ] 3. **Convert Grains to Weight**: Knowing that 1 kg of wheat contains approximately 20,000 grains, we can find the weight of the wheat in kilograms by dividing the total number of grains by 20,000. However, to find the answer in a more manageable form, we consider 1 ton of wheat, which is approximately 2 times 10^7 grains. 4. **Use Logarithms for Approximation**: To approximate the weight of the wheat needed, we use logarithms. Given lg 2 = 0.3, we can calculate: [ lg frac{2^{64} - 1}{2 times 10^7} approx lg frac{2^{64}}{2 times 10^7} = lg 2^{63} - lg 10^7 ] Simplifying further, we get: [ 63 cdot lg 2 - 7 = 63 cdot 0.3 - 7 = 11.9 ] 5. **Find the Final Answer**: The approximation above suggests that the total weight of the wheat is around 10^{11.9}, which is approximately 10^{12} kilograms.

We will demonstrate this step-by-step. 1. **Analyzing the roots of ( p(x) ):** - If ( p(x) ) has a real root (alpha ) of odd multiplicity, then ( p(x) ) changes sign at (alpha ). Therefore, because ( p(x) ) is nowhere negative, all real roots must have even multiplicity. - In complex roots cases, if ( alpha + ibeta ) is a root of ( p(x) ), then its conjugate ( alpha - ibeta ) must also be a root since the polynomial has real coefficients. 2. **Collecting real and complex roots:** - Let us consider the polynomial split into real and complex parts. For the real roots of even multiplicity, let's denote a polynomial ( q(x) ) such that ( p(x) = q(x)^2 times k(x) ), where ( q(x) ) accounts for all the real roots of even multiplicity. 3. **Dealing with complex roots:** - Let the complex roots be ( alpha_1 pm ibeta_1, alpha_2 pm ibeta_2, ldots, alpha_m pm ibeta_m ). - We can define polynomials ( a(x) ) and ( b(x) ) such that [ a(x) = prod_{i=1}^m (x - alpha_i - ibeta_i) quad text{and} quad b(x) = prod_{i=1}^m (x - alpha_i + ibeta_i). ] 4. **Expressing products in terms of real polynomials:** - Next, observe that ( a(x) ) and ( b(x) ) are conjugates. Now, using complex number representation, we can write: [ a(x) = r(x) + is(x) quad text{and} quad b(x) = r(x) - is(x) ] where ( r(x) ) and ( s(x) ) are real polynomials. 5. **Combining the polynomials:** - Hence, the product ( a(x)b(x) ) can be represented as: [ a(x)b(x) = (r(x) + is(x))(r(x) - is(x)) = r(x)^2 + s(x)^2. ] 6. **Final Representation:** - Since ( p(x) ) is nowhere negative, combining all parts, we finally get: [ p(x) = q(x)^2 times a(x)b(x) = q(x)^2 (r(x)^2 + s(x)^2). ] - Thus, ( p(x) ) is expressed as a sum of squares of real polynomials.

Let's examine the properties of sets to assess this claim. For any two sets A and B where A subseteq B, by definition, every element of A is also an element of B. The union of A and B, denoted A cup B, is the set containing all elements that are in A, or in B, or in both. Given A subseteq B, all elements of A are already included in B, thus A cup B = B. Moreover, the intersection of A and B, denoted A cap B, is the set containing all elements that are in both A and B. Since A subseteq B, it follows that A cap B = A. However, the statement A cup B = A would imply that B has no elements that are not in A, which contradicts our initial assumption unless A = B. Therefore, option boxed{text{A is incorrect}}. **B:** Consider the equation ax^2 + 2ax + 1 = 0. The claim is about the number of solutions (elements) this equation has for different values of a. When a=0, the equation simplifies to 1=0, which is false and yields no solutions, thus the set {x|ax^2 + 2ax + 1 = 0} would be an empty set, having 0 elements. This fact contradicts the claim that having only one element implies a=1 or a=0. So, boxed{text{B is incorrect}}. **C:** With the condition x < 0, we introduce a substitution t = -x > 0. Then we explore the expression t + frac{1}{t} and its behavior. By the AM-GM inequality, for t > 0, we have t + frac{1}{t} geq 2sqrt{tcdotfrac{1}{t}} = 2. Equality holds when t = frac{1}{t}, which leads to t = 1. Translating this back to the original variable, x + frac{1}{x} = -(t + frac{1}{t}) leq -2, with equality at x = -1. This demonstrates that x + frac{1}{x} indeed has a maximum value when x < 0, and this maximum value is boxed{-2}, thus boxed{text{C is correct}}. **D:** Given a > b > c and c > 0, we are to compare frac{b}{a} and frac{b+c}{a+c}.

The cost calculation is as follows: - The cost of 20 suits is 20 times 400 yuan. - Since one tie is free with each suit, the customer pays for x - 20 ties. - The cost of these ties is 80(x - 20) yuan. - Therefore, the total cost for Option 1 is: 20 times 400 + 80(x - 20) = 8000 + 80x - 1600 = 80x + 6400 yuan. For Option 2, both the suit and tie are priced at 90% of the original price. The cost calculation is: - The original cost for 20 suits and x ties is 400 times 20 + 80x yuan. - Applying the 90% discount, the total cost becomes left(400 times 20 + 80xright) times 90% = (8000 + 80x) times 0.9 = 7200 + 72x yuan.

The total cost calculation is: - The cost for 20 suits at 400 yuan each is 400 times 20 = 8000 yuan. - The cost for 10 ties at 80 yuan each with a 90% discount is 80 times 10 times 0.9 = 720 yuan. - Therefore, the total cost is 8000 + 720 = boxed{8720} yuan."},{"prompt":"A point O is chosen at random in a square piece of paper.

(Two sets are different if some weight appears a different number of times in these sets.)","completion":"First, we translate the given problem to make it clearer. We're given a set of weights, each weight an integer number of grams, with the total weight of all weights being 200 grams. A set of weights is considered \\"correct\\" if any object that weighs an integer number of grams from 1 to 200 can be balanced using some combination of weights from the set, and in only one way (an object is placed on one pan of a scale, weights on the other). We need to: a) Provide an example of a correct set of weights that doesn't consist of all weights being 1 gram each. b) Determine how many different correct sets of weights exist. # Part (a): Step-by-Step Solution: 1. The key idea is to distribute the total weight such that every object weight from 1 to 200 grams can be balanced uniquely. 2. A correct set of weights corresponds to a breakdown in binary representation. 3. The power of two strategy, {1, 2, 4, ..., 128}, works since every number from 1 to 200 can be represented as a sum of a subset of these weights. However, given the problem specifies that not all weights should be 1 gram, we need another configuration. 4. Considering another configuration without all 1-gram weights: - Use large weights and complement with smaller ones to cover gaps. Example: A valid division could be: - Two weights of 67 grams, allowing us to form weights up to 134 grams when combined with itself or other smaller weights. - The remaining 66 grams allocated to weights of 32 grams and smaller binary power weights filling interim gaps. - Example: 67, 67, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 (Note this set falls short in total weight but highlights the thought process, corrections should be made for exact 200 grams). Conclusion: A proper set fulfilling the binary coverage without all 1-gram pieces could be: - Two weights of 67 grams - Remaining weight combinations fulfilling the gap uniquely. Given constraints and ensuring uniqueness, a explicit example: - 2 weights of 67 grams - Rest as 66 weights of 1 gram each Combining two 67 grams, plus smaller weights, uniquely cover each weight from 1 to 200 grams. # Answer for Part (a): The correct set of weights could be: [ boxed{text{Two weights of 67 grams and 66 weights of 1 gram each.}} ] # Part (b): Step-by-Step Solution: 1. There must be a unique set allowing all weights from 1 to 200 grams to be measured. 2. Each configuration follows powers of binary separation allowing all intermediate unique measures. 3. Different combinations considered permutations of defined binary unique coverage weights. Given constraints: - Ensuring all combinations trace a unique measure for all 1-200 grams. Analysis: Identifying unique configurations: - We adhere to powers ensuring each prospective consideration uniquely follows binary exclusive coverages, without reseating same combinations. By unique splitting, given binary exclusive conditions there typically remain unique measure configurations. # Answer for Part (b): Hence, boxed result for total unique combinations, balancing uniquely with problem constraints: [ boxed{3 text{ unique correct sets.}} ] Proper steps detail hinge understanding hole-in exclusive binary measure permutations adhering constraint follows distinct part b configuration answering multi-set unique final output."},{"prompt":"Let a,b,c,d,e be positive real numbers.

By the definition provided, sigma(Y) = sum_{y in Y} y, we can rewrite the inner summations. 3. Consider the expression rewritten in terms of x_{k} and summations: [ = sum_{k=1}^{m} left(x_{k} left(sum_{substack{1 leq i leq n x_{k} in A_{i}}} frac{1}{sigmaleft(A_{i}right)} right)^2 right) ] 4. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: [ left(sum_{k=1}^{m} x_{k} z_{k}right)^2 leq left(sum_{k=1}^{m} x_{k}^2right) left(sum_{k=1}^{m} z_{k}^2right) ] Here, we set ( x_{k} = x_{k} ) and ( z_{k} = sum_{substack{1 leq i leq n x_{k} in A_{i}}} frac{1}{sigma(A_i)} ). 5.

Note that ( K ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), which means ( AK = BK ). 4. Also, since ( AN = 2NC ), in other words, point ( N ) divides the segment ( AC ) in the ratio ( 2:1 ). 5. The segment ( KM ) is considered the midline of ( triangle ABC ), thus it is parallel to ( AC ) and its length is half that of ( AC ). Hence: [ KM = frac{1}{2} AC = frac{3}{4} AN ] 6.

Consequently, the minimal polynomial of omega over mathbb{Q} is the nth cyclotomic polynomial, denoted as Phi_n(x). 2. **Polynomial Relationship**: - Given our conditions, we have: [ |f(omega)| = 1 implies f(omega) cdot overline{f(omega)} = 1. ] - Since omega is a root of unity, overline{omega} = omega^{-1}. Thus, [ f(omega) cdot f(omega^{-1}) = 1. ] 3. **Cyclotomic Polynomial Divisibility**: - Since Phi_n(x) is the minimal polynomial of omega, it follows that Phi_n(x) mid f(x) f(x^{-1}) - 1. This divisibility must hold when viewed as Laurent polynomials. 4. **Evaluation at Related Roots**: - Given Phi_n(x) mid f(x) f(x^{-1}) - 1, it follows that: [ left| f(omega^k) right| = 1 quad text{whenever} ; operatorname{gcd}(k, n) = 1. ] 5. **Constructing a Monic Integer-coefficient Polynomial**: - Consider the polynomial: [ prod_{operatorname{gcd}(k, n) = 1} left(t - f(omega^k) right) ] - This polynomial is monic and has coefficients in the integers. All its roots must lie on the unit circle in the complex plane. 6. **Roots of Unity**: - By a classical result (sometimes known as Kronecker’s theorem), a monic integer-coefficient polynomial whose roots lie on the unit circle must have roots that are either 0 or roots of unity. Since 0 is not a root, all roots of the polynomial must be roots of unity. - Thus, f(omega) must be a root of unity. # Conclusion: Using the properties of cyclotomic polynomials and the classical result about monic integer-coefficient polynomials, we conclude that if |f(omega)| = 1 for a root of unity omega, then f(omega) must also be a root of unity. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Suppose ( q(x) ) is a function such that ( q(x) + (2x^6 + 4x^4 + 6x^2 + 2) = (8x^4 + 27x^3 + 30x^2 + 10x + 3) ).

We want to determine the maximum value of the right-hand side in the interval [0,1] because a must be less than this maximum for the inequality to hold for some x in the interval. To find this maximum, we analyze the function f(x) = 2^{-x} - 3x over the interval [0,1]. First, let's examine the monotonicity of f(x). The function f(x) is the sum of a monotonically decreasing exponential term 2^{-x} and a linear term -3x which is also monotonically decreasing over the interval [0,1]. Since both terms decrease as x increases, f(x) is monotonically decreasing overall on [0,1]. Hence, the maximum value of f(x) occurs at the lower bound of the interval, i.e., at x=0. Substituting x=0 into f(x) gives us: f(0) = 2^{-0} - 3(0) = 1 - 0 = 1.

Step 1: Define the set S_n and its properties The set S_n consists of all integer-coordinate points (x, y) such that: [ left|xright| + left|y + frac {1}{2}right| < n. ] This inequality describes a diamond-shaped region centered at (0, -frac{1}{2}) with \\"radius\\" n. Step 2: Coloring the points in S_n Color all points in S_n using two colors (say red and black) such that: - Each row of points starts and ends with a red point. - Colors alternate between red and black within each row. This coloring scheme ensures that each row has a checkerboard pattern, except that the middle two rows are identical due to the shift by frac{1}{2} in the y-coordinate. Step 3: Assume a partition into fewer than n paths Suppose there exists a partition of S_n into m < n paths. Consider the implications of this partition: - Each path is a sequence of adjacent points (neighbors in the lattice). - Since each row starts and ends with a red point, and colors alternate, any path that traverses an entire row from one end to the other must contain consecutive red points. Step 4: Breaking paths at consecutive red points For each path, if there are consecutive red points, we can split the path at these points. This operation increases the number of paths. Since the middle two rows are identical and contain n consecutive red pairs, splitting at these points results in at least m + n paths. Step 5: Counting red and black points In a path with alternating colors, there can be at most one more red point than black points. Therefore, across all paths, the total number of red points cannot exceed the number of black points by more than the total number of paths. Step 6: Contradiction on the number of red and black points Since the coloring scheme starts and ends each row with a red point, and each row has an odd length (due to the diamond shape and the shift in y-coordinate), there are more red points than black points in S_n. Specifically, there are 2n more red points than black points. Thus, we have: [ 2n leq m + n, ] which simplifies to n leq m. This contradicts the assumption that m < n.

For a fair coin, the probability of getting tails (T) is 1/2, and for the biased coin, the probability of getting tails is 1 - (probability of heads) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. Let's denote the fair coins as F and the biased coin as B. The sequence of coins is F, F, B, F, F. We can have at least 3 tails in a row in the following ways: 1. The first three coins are tails: TTTXX 2. The middle three coins are tails: XTTFX 3. The last three coins are tails: XXTTT 4. The first four coins are tails: TTTTX 5. The last four coins are tails: XTTTT 6. All five coins are tails: TTTTT Let's calculate the probability for each case: 1. TTTXX: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/12 2. XTTFX: (1/2) * (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/12 3. XXTTT: (1/3) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/12 4. TTTTX: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/24 5. XTTTT: (1/3) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/24 6. TTTTT: (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/3) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/48 Now, we add up the probabilities of each case to get the total probability of getting at least 3 tails in a row: Total probability = 1/12 + 1/12 + 1/12 + 1/24 + 1/24 + 1/48 Total probability = 4/24 + 2/24 + 1/48 Total probability = 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/48 Total probability = 8/48 + 4/48 + 1/48 Total probability = 13/48 Therefore, the probability of getting at least 3 tails in a row when tossing two fair coins, one biased coin, and two more fair coins is boxed{13/48} ."},{"prompt":"Calculate: 3a+2b2(ab).","completion":"**Analysis:** According to the rule of removing parentheses: if there is a negative sign in front of the parentheses, the signs of all terms inside the parentheses change.

We can achieve this by considering the combinations of yield recovery in the first year and the growth in the second year that result in the yield being exactly the pre-disaster level. 1. If the yield recovers to 1.0 times the pre-disaster level in the first year (with a probability of 0.2), it needs to remain the same in the second year (with a probability of 0.4) to reach the pre-disaster level. The combined probability is 0.2 times 0.4 = 0.08. 2. If the yield recovers to 0.9 times the pre-disaster level in the first year (with a probability of 0.4), it needs to increase to 1.25 times the first year's yield in the second year (with a probability of 0.3) to reach the pre-disaster level.

The combined probability is 0.4 times 0.3 = 0.12. However, the third scenario is not feasible because increasing 0.8 times the pre-disaster level by 1.5 times does not result in the pre-disaster level. Therefore, we only consider the first two scenarios. Adding the probabilities of these two feasible scenarios gives us the total probability of the citrus yield exactly reaching the pre-disaster level after two years: 0.08 + 0.12 = 0.20.

She makes another payment of 5 towards the gas bill. So, the total paid for the gas bill is 30 + 5 = 35. The remaining amount for the gas bill is 40 - 35 = 5. Next, let's calculate the amount paid for the internet bill: She made 4 payments of 5, so she has paid 20 (since 4 * 5 = 20). The remaining amount for the internet bill is 25 - 20 = 5.

We know that 5 is for the gas bill and 5 is for the internet bill, so the remaining 20 must be for the water bill.

How much does a large monkey doll cost?","completion":"Let's denote the cost of a large monkey doll as L dollars. Since the small monkey dolls are 4 cheaper, the cost of a small monkey doll would be L - 4. If John buys only large monkey dolls, the number of large dolls he can buy is 320 / L. If he buys only small monkey dolls, the number of small dolls he can buy is 320 / (L - 4). According to the information given, John could buy 40 more small dolls than large dolls. So we can set up the following equation: 320 / (L - 4) = 320 / L + 40 Now, let's solve for L: 1. Multiply both sides of the equation by L(L - 4) to get rid of the denominators: 320L = 320(L - 4) + 40L(L - 4) 2. Distribute the 320 on the right side of the equation: 320L = 320L - 1280 + 40L^2 - 160L 3. Move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero: 40L^2 - 160L - 1280 = 0 4. Divide the entire equation by 40 to simplify: L^2 - 4L - 32 = 0 5. Factor the quadratic equation: (L - 8)(L + 4) = 0 6. Solve for L: L - 8 = 0 or L + 4 = 0 L = 8 or L = -4 Since the cost of a doll cannot be negative, we discard L = -4.

According to the given information, the cost price of 8 books is equal to the selling price of 16 books. So we can write the equation: 8C = 16S Now, we can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 8: C = 2S This means that the cost price is twice the selling price. To find the gain or loss percentage, we need to compare the selling price with the cost price. Since the selling price (S) is half of the cost price (C), this means that for every book sold, there is a loss of C - S. Loss per book = C - S = C - (C/2) = C/2 The loss percentage is calculated as: Loss Percentage = (Loss per book / Cost price per book) * 100% = (C/2 / C) * 100% = (1/2) * 100% = 50% Therefore, there is a loss of boxed{50%} on the books."},{"prompt":"f a function f(x) defined on mathbb{R} satisfies: for any x_{1} neq x_{2}, we have x_{1}f(x_{1})+x_{2}f(x_{2}) geqslant x_{1}f(x_{2})+x_{2}f(x_{1}), then f(x) is called an H function.

Inspector Craig asked the native, \\"If someone asks you whether twice two is four, and you decide to answer in your native language, will you answer 'bal'?\\" 2. The recorded note indicates that from the provided answer, Inspector Craig could determine whom he was speaking with: a zombie, a half-zombie, or a normal person. 3. We need to consider the forces at play in this problem. The native could be categorized into one of three types: - Normal person: Always tells the truth. - Zombie: Always lies. - Half-zombie: Alternates between truth and lie. 4. If the native was to answer \\"bal,\\" there are several cases: - If \\"bal\\" means \\"yes,\\" then a normal person answering truthfully would answer \\"yes.\\" - If \\"bal\\" means \\"yes,\\" a zombie who always lies would deny that 2 + 2 equals 4, but since the inspector asked about the response in their native language, even their lie should be \\"yes\\" as they would contradict the common truth by still trying to give a \\"false\\" impression. 5. Thus, the Inspector could conclude the following in any consistent manner only if the response was clearly distinguishable among the types. Since a normal person and a zombie would both respond similarly, they might not help distinguish one another. This leaves the possibility of understanding if the respondent is half-zombie, as they have a unique manner of alternating between truth and lie. 6. The critical observation is that for the inspector Craig to conclude with certainty, \\"bal\\" must be a stable distinguishing answer: - Considering half-zombies who alternate, if \\"bal\\" aligns always with the intended query consistency, the detection margin is in alignment frequency of truth and lie. 7. Thus, the only stable result is if Craig deduced the mutual responses responding uniformly between truth-speaking (normal) and always lie (zombie). The distinguishing framework resonates around consistency which only is confirmable via half-zombie uniquely identifiable switch or \\"bal\\" confirming the normative state. **Conclusion**: The native must have answered “yes” in their native tongue directly allowing inspector Craig to determine the encountered type. Thus, allowing interpretive differentiation aligning logical conformity to \`half-zombie\` detection. boxed{'да'}"},{"prompt":"Let a,b,c>0 the sides of a right triangle.

First, consider the case when (x = 2): [ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 ] This shows that the equality holds at (x = 2). 4. Now, consider (x > 2). We need to show that (a^x > b^x + c^x). Using the fact that (a^2 = b^2 + c^2), we can write: [ a^x = (a^2)^{x/2} = (b^2 + c^2)^{x/2} ] 5. Since (a) is the longest side, we have (a > b) and (a > c). For (x > 2), the function (f(t) = t^{x/2}) is convex for (t > 0). By the convexity of the function, we have: [ (b^2 + c^2)^{x/2} > b^x + c^x ] This is because the sum of the (x/2)-th powers of (b) and (c) is less than the (x/2)-th power of their sum. 6.

The cost for the chili pepper seeds is 0.90 per packet, and Harry bought 5 packets, so the total cost for the chili pepper seeds is 0.90 * 5 = 4.50. The total amount Harry spent is 18, so we can set up the following equation to represent the total cost: 2.50P (pumpkin seeds) + 6.00 (tomato seeds) + 4.50 (chili pepper seeds) = 18.00 Now, we can solve for P: 2.50P + 6.00 + 4.50 = 18.00 2.50P + 10.50 = 18.00 2.50P = 18.00 - 10.50 2.50P = 7.50 Now, divide both sides by 2.50 to find P: P = 7.50 / 2.50 P = 3 Harry bought boxed{3} packets of pumpkin seeds."},{"prompt":"Solve the equation [frac{x + 5}{x^2 + 4x + 10} = 0.]","completion":"To solve the equation (frac{x + 5}{x^2 + 4x + 10} = 0), we set the numerator equal to zero since the denominator cannot be zero. 1.

This creates two right triangles ( O_1KA ) and ( O_2LB ). 4. The distance between the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) is ( R + r ). Since ( AB ) is tangential to both circles, the lengths of the perpendiculars from the centers to ( AB ) are equal to the radii of the respective circles. Thus, ( O_1K = r ) and ( O_2L = R ). 5.

Using the combinatorial argument, the maximum number of regions R(n) formed by n curves, where each pair of curves intersects at most at m points, can be represented as: R(n) = binom{n}{0} + binom{n}{1} + binom{n}{2} + ldots + binom{n}{m} For parabolas described by y = a x^{2} + b x + c, where m = 2 (since they can intersect at most at 2 points), we have: R(50) = binom{50}{0} + binom{50}{1} + binom{50}{2} We know: binom{50}{0} = 1, quad binom{50}{1} = 50, quad binom{50}{2} = frac{50 times 49}{2} = 1225 Thus: R(50) = 1 + 50 + 1225 = 1276 2. Similarly, for 50 different parabolas given by x = a_{1} y^{2} + b_{1} y + c_{1}, the analysis is the same: R(50) = binom{50}{0} + binom{50}{1} + binom{50}{2} = 1 + 50 + 1225 = 1276 3. Now, consider the intersections between 50 parabolas of form y = a x^{2} + b x + c and 50 parabolas of form x = a_{1} y^{2} + b_{1} y + c_{1}. Each pair, one from the first set and one from the second set, can intersect at most at 4 points (since substituting one into the other results in a quartic equation, which has up to 4 real solutions). 4. The total number of intersections between the two sets would be: 50 times 50 times 4 = 10000 These intersections will further divide the regions formed by each curve set individually. If each intersection point divides a region into another region, it adds 1 to the count.

First, we perform simple random sampling to exclude 10 students, leaving us with 2000 students. Next, we are supposed to use systematic sampling to select among the remaining 2000 students. With simple random sampling, each student initially had an equal probability of being selected. The probability of being selected for any given student is therefore the number of students to be selected divided by the total number of students: text{Probability} = frac{text{Number of students selected}}{text{Total number of students}} = frac{50}{2010} = frac{5}{201}. However, once we remove 10 students randomly, we have 2000 students left and continue with systematic sampling. In systematic sampling, every k-th person is selected after a starting point is randomly chosen. In this case, to select 50 students from 2000, we pick every 40th student (frac{2000}{50} = 40). Although the starting point is randomly chosen which gives the apparent illusion of equal chances, systematic sampling does not guarantee that every student has an equal probability of being selected. This is because the probability can vary depending on the chosen starting point, especially near the beginning and end of the list of 2000 students. Hence, given that the sampling involves two steps with different methods, the probability is not the same for every student, which makes option A incorrect. Moreover, the final probability for each student to be selected is not frac{5}{201} because after excluding 10 students, the sampling method has changed. The final probability for each student to be selected is also not frac{1}{40}, because this would only be true if we were selecting 50 students out of 2000 in a simple random manner, but we have a systematic approach influencing the probability. Therefore, since the probabilities are neither all equal nor are they exactly frac{5}{201} or frac{1}{40} for each student, the correct answer is that they are not all equal as a result of the systematic sampling method used after the initial random sampling.

To eliminate one of the variables, subtract twice the second equation from the first equation: [ f(x) + 2 fleft(frac{1}{x}right) - 2 left( fleft(frac{1}{x}right) + 2 f(x) right) = 3x + 6 - 2 left( frac{3}{x} + 6 right). ] Simplify the left-hand side: [ f(x) + 2 fleft(frac{1}{x}right) - 2fleft(frac{1}{x}right) - 4f(x) = 3x + 6 - frac{6}{x} - 12. ] Combining like terms: [ -3f(x) = 3x - frac{6}{x} - 6. ] 5. Solve for ( f(x) ) by dividing both sides by (-3): [ f(x) = frac{3x - frac{6}{x} - 6}{-3} = -x + frac{2}{x} + 2. ] 6. Verify the solution by substituting ( f(x) = frac{2}{x} - x + 2 ) back into the original equations. First, compute ( fleft(frac{1}{x}right) ): [ fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = frac{2}{frac{1}{x}} - frac{1}{x} + 2 = 2x - frac{1}{x} + 2. ] 7. Substitute ( f(x) ) and ( fleft(frac{1}{x}right) ) into the first equation: [ f(x) + 2 fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = left( frac{2}{x} - x + 2 right) + 2 left( 2x - frac{1}{x} + 2 right). ] Calculate each term: [ f(x) + 2 fleft(frac{1}{x}right) = frac{2}{x} - x + 2 + 2(2x - frac{1}{x} + 2). ] Combine the terms: [ = frac{2}{x} - x + 2 + 4x - frac{2}{x} + 4 = -x + 4x + 6 = 3x + 6, ] which satisfies the original functional equation.

Then we need to check: [ a_i + a_j > a_k ] - Since (a_i, a_j in (x, x+2)) and (a_k in (x-2, x+4)), we have: [ a_i + a_j > 2x quad text{and} quad a_k < x+4 ] - Therefore, (a_i + a_j > a_k) is satisfied because (2x > x+4) for (x > 1). 4. **Conclusion:** - Since we can always find three numbers (a_i, a_j, a_k) that satisfy the triangle inequality, we can conclude that it is always possible to choose three numbers from the set ( {a_1, a_2, cdots, a_7} ) such that they are the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

Since triangle ABC is isosceles and AD is an altitude, AD bisects angle A. This makes E, the foot of the perpendicular from B to AD, lie directly on AD. 3. **Relating BE and BD**: As BE is the altitude to the median AD of isosceles triangle ABC, BE bisects BD because the altitude to the hypotenuse of a right triangle bisects the hypotenuse.

Let us analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Identifying Winning and Losing Positions:** - A **losing position** is defined as one from which any move leads to a winning position for the opponent. - By contrast, a **winning position** is one from which the player can force a move leading to a losing position for the opponent. 2. **Consideration of Moves and Positional Change:** - Any move involves taking one of the extreme balls and placing it into an empty slot between the other two balls. This changes the positional arrangement dynamically. 3. **Parity Argument:** - An important observation is the parity of the number of empty slots N and K. - If both N and K are even, then the sum of the positions is even. - If at least one of N or K is odd, then the sum of the positions is odd. 4. **Winning and Losing Strategy Analysis:** - In a **losing position**, both N and K are even. - Making a move from an even configuration breaks the balances, turning it into an odd configuration because: [ N + K quad text{being even.} quad text{Say } N + K = 2m quad text{(even)} ] On taking a ball and placing it inside this configuration, results in: [ text{two new smaller partitions (odd sum balancing disappearing)} ] 5. **Mathematical Formalism and Generalization:** - For even sums, an appropriate move will always yield one odd partition, classifying it as a **winning position** for the initiator. - Conversely, if the combined moves sum leads to odd parity, generally maneuvering directs it to a **losing** paradigm. 6. **Initial Setup and Conclusions:** By implementing these theoretical insights into the specific problem provided (illustrations aid us), establishing the winning positions simplifies. We can continue this analysis in practical terms, involving: - **Cases Analysis:** - (a) and (c): First player wins. - (b): Second player wins. - (d): First player wins if N+K is odd.

We can find the homogeneous solution by solving {f''(x) - f(x) = 0}. The characteristic equation is r^2 - 1 = 0, giving r = pm 1. So, the homogeneous solution is f_h(x) = c_1e^x + c_2e^{-x}. 2. For the particular solution, let's use the method of undetermined coefficients and assume f_p(x) = Axe^x. Taking the first and second derivatives, we get {f_p'(x) = A(x + 1)e^x} and {f_p''(x) = A(x + 2)e^x}. Plugging these back into the differential equation, we get: A(x + 2)e^x - Axe^x = xe^x Comparing the coefficients, we find A = frac{1}{2}. So, the particular solution is {f_p(x) = frac{1}{2}xe^x}. 3.

Also, since c_1 + c_2 = 1, we know that at least one of c_1 or c_2 must be positive. Therefore, {c_1e^x + c_2e^{-x} > 0}. 7. Consequently, {frac{f''(x)}{f(x)} > 0}, so the range of values cannot be option A. 8. To determine whether the range includes 1, we need to find a specific case in which {frac{f''(x)}{f(x)} = 1}.

Since the jacket is on sale with a 10% discount, the sale price of the jacket will be 90% of 80. Sale price of jacket = 80 * (1 - 0.10) = 80 * 0.90 = 72 Now, Kevin is buying 6 T-shirts, 4 sweaters, and 5 jackets. The total cost before tax for these items is: Total cost before tax = (6 * T) + (4 * 18) + (5 * 72) We also know that the sales tax is 5%, so the total cost including tax is: Total cost including tax = Total cost before tax * (1 + 0.05) According to the information given, Kevin has to pay 504 for all the items, including the sales tax.

According to the problem, the length of the floor is more than its breadth by 200%. This means the length is 200% of B plus B itself, which can be expressed as: Length (L) = B + 200% of B L = B + 2B L = 3B The area of the floor is the product of its length and breadth, so: Area = L * B Area = 3B * B Area = 3B^2 We are given that Rs. 300 is required to paint the floor at the rate of Rs. 5 per sq m. This means the area of the floor can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the rate per square meter: Area = Total cost / Rate per sq m 300 Rs / 5 Rs/sq m = 60 sq m Now we know that the area is 60 sq m and it is also equal to 3B^2. So we can set up the equation: 3B^2 = 60 To find B, we divide both sides by 3: B^2 = 60 / 3 B^2 = 20 Taking the square root of both sides to solve for B: B = √20 B = 4.472 meters (approximately) Now that we have the breadth, we can find the length using the relationship L = 3B: L = 3 * 4.472 meters L = 13.416 meters (approximately) So the length of the floor is approximately boxed{13.416} meters."},{"prompt":"Let k be a given positive integer.

Now we introduce a 1 in a clever way to facilitate the application of the AM-GM inequality (the arithmetic mean - geometric mean inequality): frac{4}{y} + frac{1}{x} = 1. Next, we express x+y in a form that will allow us to use the AM-GM inequality.

This leads to the condition (a_{4}+1)^2 = (a_{3}-1)(a_{7}+3). Substituting a_3 = 5 into this equation, we get (6+d)^2 = 4(8+4d). 4. **Solving for d**: Simplifying the equation (6+d)^2 = 4(8+4d), we find that d = 2. 5. **General Formula for {a_{n}}**: With d = 2 and a_3 = 5, the general formula for the sequence is a_{n} = a_{3} + (n-3)d = 5 + (n-3)cdot2 = 2n - 1. Therefore, the general formula for the sequence {a_{n}} is boxed{a_{n} = 2n - 1}. Part (Ⅱ): Calculating T_{2n} for the Sequence {b_{n}} 1. **Definition of {b_{n}}**: Given b_{n} = (-1)^{n}a_{n} + 1, and using the formula for a_{n} from Part (Ⅰ), we have b_{n} = (-1)^{n}(2n-1) + 1. 2. **Sum of the First 2n Terms, T_{2n}**: To find T_{2n}, we sum the first 2n terms of {b_{n}}. This sum can be broken down as follows: - For even n, b_{n} = -(2n-1) + 1 = -2n + 2. - For odd n, b_{n} = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n. - Pairing each odd term with the next even term, we get sums of 4 for each pair: (-1+1)+(3+1)+(-5+1)+(7+1)+ldots+[-(4n-3)+1]+(4n-1+1) = 4n. Therefore, the sum of the first 2n terms of the sequence {b_{n}}, T_{2n}, is boxed{4n}."},{"prompt":"A pizza shop offers eight different toppings.

The probability that exactly k enthusiasts out of 20 take less than 10 seconds is given by the binomial probability formula P(X=k) = C_{20}^{k} cdot 0.2^{k} cdot 0.8^{20-k}, where k=0,1,2,ldots,20.

Since k must be an integer (as it represents the number of people), the only value of k that satisfies this condition is k=4.

For x in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], we find the derivative of f(x) as follows: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - cos x) = 2x + sin x. Since 2x geq 0 and sin x geq 0 within the given interval, we have f'(x) geq 0 which indicates that f(x) is monotonically increasing in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right]. Therefore, the set of solutions for x in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right] that satisfy f(x_0) > fleft(frac{pi}{6}right) is given by the interval left(frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{2}right]. Taking into account the even nature of the function, and reflecting the interval across the y-axis, the range of x_0 for the original problem is obtained as: boxed{left[-frac{pi}{2}, -frac{pi}{6}right) cup left(frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{2}right]} When considering the function f(x) = x^2 - cos x, we leveraged the fact that it is even and symmetric about the y-axis, allowing us to focus on the behavior within the interval left[0, frac{pi}{2}right].

Hence, we should consider planes that intersect the ellipsoid. When a plane ( P ) cuts through an ellipsoid, the intersection will generally form an ellipse. 3. **Intersection of the Plane with the Ellipsoid:** To show this, we can substitute the equation of the plane into the equation of the ellipsoid. Doing so yields a quadratic equation representing the projection of the intersection onto one of the coordinate planes. Since the resulting intersection is bounded, it must form an ellipse. Thus, projecting back confirms that this intersection is indeed an ellipse. 4. **Maximizing the Intersection Size:** To find the largest possible circle, consider planes parallel to one another. Parallel planes will yield similar ellipses. Therefore, the maximal circle is obtained by taking a plane ( P ) that passes through the center of the ellipsoid. 5. **Characterizing the Circle:** Suppose the plane ( P ) intersects the ellipsoid and forms a circle ( K ). Plane ( P ) cannot be normal to any of the semi-axes ((a), (b), or (c)), as that would result in an ellipse with unequal semi-axes. 6. **Identifying the Plane of Intersection:** The plane ( P ) must intersect the ( bc )-plane along a line. This line represents the diameter of the circle ( K ). Since the largest possible semi-major axis length in this case would be along the ( b ) direction, the diameter of ( K ) must be at most ( 2b ). 7. **Diameter Analysis:** - Similarly, the plane ( P ) will intersect the ( ab )-plane along a line that has a length of at least ( 2b ). Hence, the diameter of ( K ) is at least ( 2b ). - Consequently, due to these constraints, ( K ) must have a radius of ( b ). 8. **Verifying the Existence of the Circle:** To confirm the existence of such a plane, consider a plane passing through the semi-major axis ( b ) of the ellipsoid. The intersection will have one of its diameters as ( 2b ). The ellipse formed in this intersection will be symmetric about this diameter, necessarily making it one of the ellipse’s two semi-major axes. 9. **Rotating the Plane:** If we rotate the plane to also include the semi-major axis ( c ) of the ellipsoid, the intersection ( K ) will gain another perpendicular diameter of length ( 2c ). Rotating this plane further through a right angle will modify the length of this perpendicular diameter from ( 2c ) up to ( 2a ). 10. **Finding the Circle:** As we rotate the plane, there must be an intermediate angle where this perpendicular diameter of the ellipse precisely equals ( 2b ). At this point, both diameters of the ellipse are equal, making it a circle. # Conclusion: Thus, the radius of the largest possible circle on the ellipsoid is ( b ).

This means that the increase in expenses has reduced his savings by the difference between the original savings and the new savings: 727.2727272727273 - 400 = Rs. 327.2727272727273 This reduction of Rs. 327.2727272727273 is the result of the P% increase in his expenses. To find the percentage increase, we need to know what his original expenses were. Since he saved 10% of his salary, he spent 90% of it. So, his original expenses were: 0.90 * S = 0.90 * 7272.727272727273 = Rs. 6545.454545454546 Now, we can calculate the percentage increase in his expenses (P%) by dividing the increase in expenses by the original expenses and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage: P% = (Increase in expenses / Original expenses) * 100 P% = (327.2727272727273 / 6545.454545454546) * 100 Let's calculate P%: P% = (327.2727272727273 / 6545.454545454546) * 100 P% ≈ (0.05) * 100 P% ≈ 5% Therefore, the man increases his monthly expenses by approximately boxed{5%} ."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, angle B = 60^circ and angle C = 45^circ.

We need to calculate the area of the region between the arc ( widehat{A B} ) and the arc ( widehat{C D} ). 2. **Understand the key formula for the area of a circular segment:** The area ( T ) of a circular segment is given by [ T = frac{1}{2} r^{2} (alpha - sin alpha) ] where ( r ) is the radius, ( alpha ) is the central angle in radians, and ( alpha ) is the measure of the central angle in radians. 3. **Determine the central angles for the square and the hexagon:** - The central angle subtended by a side of the square (between ( A ) and ( B )) is ( 90^circ = frac{pi}{2} ) radians. - The central angle subtended by a side of the regular hexagon (between ( C ) and ( D )) is ( 60^circ = frac{pi}{3} ) radians. 4. **Calculate the area of the segments:** Using the formula for the segment area, - **For the segment defined by ( widehat{A B} ):** [ T_{AB} = frac{1}{2} r^2 left( frac{pi}{2} - sin frac{pi}{2} right) ] Simplifying, [ T_{AB} = frac{1}{2} cdot 6^2 left( frac{pi}{2} - 1 right) ] [ T_{AB} = frac{1}{2} cdot 36 left( frac{pi}{2} - 1 right) ] [ T_{AB} = 18 left( frac{pi}{2} - 1 right) ] - **For the segment defined by ( widehat{C D} ):** [ T_{CD} = frac{1}{2} r^2 left( frac{pi}{3} - sin frac{pi}{3} right) ] Simplifying further, [ T_{CD} = frac{1}{2} cdot 6^2 left( frac{pi}{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ] [ T_{CD} = frac{1}{2} cdot 36 left( frac{pi}{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ] [ T_{CD} = 18 left( frac{pi}{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ] 5. **Calculate the difference in areas between the two segments:** We need to find ( T_{difference} = T_{AB} - T_{CD} ): [ T_{difference} = 18 left( frac{pi}{2} - 1 right) - 18 left( frac{pi}{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ] Simplifying further, [ T_{difference} = 18 left[ left( frac{pi}{2} - 1 right) - left( frac{pi}{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) right] ] [ = 18 left( frac{pi}{2} - frac{pi}{3} - 1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ] [ = 18 left( frac{3pi}{6} - frac{2pi}{6} - 1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ] [ = 18 left( frac{pi}{6} - 1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ] 6. **Evaluate the numerical value:** Using (pi approx 3.14159) and (sqrt{3} approx 1.732): [ T_{difference} approx 18 left( frac{3.14159}{6} - 1 + frac{1.732}{2} right) ] [ T_{difference} approx 18 left( 0.5236 - 1 + 0.866 right) ] [ T_{difference} approx 18 left( 0.5236 - 0.134 right) ] [ T_{difference} approx 18 times 0.3896 ] [ T_{difference} approx 7.013 ] 7. **Conclusion:** Since there are two such regions in the circle opposite to each other, the total area we are looking for is twice this value: [ 2 times 7.013 = 14.026 ] Thus, the area of the part of the circle between the hexagon and the square is approximately [ boxed{14.03 text{cm}^2} ]"},{"prompt":"Joan is at the grocery store.

A triangle has sides that form an arithmetic progression. 2. The angles also form an arithmetic progression. 3. The area of the triangle is (50 , text{cm}^2). 4. The radius of the circumscribed circle is (10 , text{cm}). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Identify the Arithmetic Sequence for Angles:** Since the angles form an arithmetic progression and their sum is (180^circ), we can denote them as: [ alpha, quad beta, quad gamma quad text{with} quad beta = 60^circ ] Because (beta) is the middle term of the arithmetic progression of angles: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ implies alpha + 60^circ + gamma = 180^circ implies alpha + gamma = 120^circ ] 2. **Identify the Arithmetic Sequence for Sides:** The sides can be expressed as: [ b - d, quad b, quad b + d quad text{with} quad d < b ] Here, (b) is the side opposite to the (60^circ) angle ((beta)) since it is the middle term of the arithmetic progression. 3. **Apply the Cosine Rule:** Using the cosine rule for side (b): [ b^2 = (b-d)^2 + (b+d)^2 - 2(b-d)(b+d)cos(60^circ) ] Simplifying: [ b^2 = (b-d)^2 + (b+d)^2 - 2(b-d)(b+d) cdot frac{1}{2} ] [ b^2 = b^2 - 2bd + d^2 + b^2 + 2bd + d^2 - (b^2 - d^2) ] [ b^2 = b^2 + 3d^2 ] This implies: [ d = 0 ] Hence, the triangle must be equilateral with all sides equal, i.e., all sides are (b). 4. **Calculate using Area and Radius of Circumscribed Circle:** The area for an equilateral triangle (triangle ABC) is given by: [ T = frac{b^2 sqrt{3}}{4} ] Given that (T = 50 , text{cm}^2): [ frac{b^2 sqrt{3}}{4} = 50 implies b^2 sqrt{3} = 200 implies b^2 = frac{200}{sqrt{3}} implies b = sqrt{frac{200}{sqrt{3}}} ] Simplifying: [ b approx 10.7 , text{cm} ] For the circumscribed circle's radius ((R)) where (R = 10 , text{cm}), the radius of an equilateral triangle is: [ R = frac{b}{sqrt{3}} implies 10 = frac{b}{sqrt{3}} implies b = 10sqrt{3} ] Converting: [ b approx 17.3 , text{cm} ] Since we get two different values for (b), these conditions cannot be satisfied together, resulting in a contradiction.

We will demonstrate that: [ angle AMK = angle AEB = angle ABK, ] hence, M lies on the circumcircle of the isosceles triangle KAB. Since the circle contains the isosceles triangle KAB, M is also on the Thales' circle drawn over the segment KO, where O is the center of the given circle. Steps: 1. **Analysis of Angles:** - We start by noting that (angle AMK) and (angle AEB) are equal. This is because they are corresponding angles created by the parallel lines (KC) and (EB) with the transversal line (AE). - Hence, [angle AMK = angle AEB.] 2. **Angle Relations:** - Notice that (angle AEB) subtends the arc (AB) in the circle, making it a central angle. - Also, [angle AEB = angle ABK,] since (angle ABK) is the angle between the tangent (AB) at (B) and the line segment (BK). 3. **Circumcircle of (triangle KAB):** - Given that [angle AMK = angle AEB = angle ABK,] point (M) lies on the circumcircle of (triangle KAB). - By the construction of the tangents and their properties, this circumcircle must be the Thales' circle drawn over the diameter (KO). 4. **Orthogonality:** - (KO) seen from any point on this Thales' circle (including (M)) subtends a right angle. Therefore, (angle KMO = 90^circ). 5. **Midpoint of Chord (CD):** - As (M) lies on the perpendicular bisector of (CD) because of the right angle (angle KMO), it follows that (M) is indeed the midpoint of chord (CD).

Substitute frac{p}{q} into the quadratic equation: [ a left(frac{p}{q}right)^2 + b left(frac{p}{q}right) + c = 0 ] 5.

The problem outlines several exceptions where tiling is not possible, and we will explore the 5 times 7 case in detail since it can be representative of the others. Necessary Condition: 1. Consider the 5 times 7 rectangle and attempt to assign values to the small squares within it: - Assign values -2 to black squares. - Assign values 1 to white squares. 2. Each tiling cover of three squares has a non-negative sum of assigned values because the three tiles cover either two white squares and one black square, yielding a sum of 1 times 2 + (-2) times 1 = 0, or three white squares, yielding a non-negative sum. Therefore, the total assigned value sum must be non-negative. 3. Calculate the number of black and white squares in a 5 times 7 rectangle: - There are 12 black squares: 12 times -2 = -24 points. - There are 35 - 12 = 23 white squares: 23 times 1 = 23 points. 4. Thus, the total sum for the whole arrangement is: [ -24k + 23k = -k ] - This sum needs to be non-negative, but -k is non-negative only if k leq 0, which contradicts our initial assumption that every square is covered exactly k times. Hence, a 5 times 7 rectangle cannot be tiled in this manner. Sufficient Condition: By contrast, it is possible to cover certain other rectangles with a consistent coverage level: 1. A 2 times 2 square can be covered such that each part of the square is covered exactly three times. 2. A 2 times 3 square can also be covered, and thus it is possible to cover any rectangle with consistency. 3. For even dimensions: - (2m) times (2n) can be decomposed into mn pieces of 2 times 2 squares, each covered exactly three times. 4. For dimensions with one odd side: - (2m) times (2n + 1) = (2m) times 2(n-1) oplus (2m) times 3. Both parts can be tiled appropriately. 5.

We aim to prove that the line (XP) passes through the midpoint (T) of ([MN]). 1. **Observation with the Midpoint (M):** - Since (M) is the midpoint of ([AB]), and (P) is the foot of the altitude from (A) to (BC), triangle (ABP) is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at (P). - In a right-angled triangle, the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the circumcenter. Therefore, (M) is the circumcenter of triangle (ABP). Thus, the circumradius is (MB = frac{AB}{2}). - Consequently, (MBP) is an isosceles triangle, with (MB = MP). 2. **Parallel Lines Analysis:** - Since ( (MN) parallel (BC) ), angle relationships can be deduced. - The angle (widehat{TMP}) is equal to (widehat{MPB}) because (TM = TN). 3. **Tangency Property at (M):** - By the angle property and the parallel lines, ((TM)) is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle (MBP) at (M). This follows from the tangential angle theorem which states that an angle subtended by a tangent is half the angle subtended by the corresponding chord. 4. **Power of Point (T):** - The power of point (T) with respect to circle ((MBP)) is derived from the tangency: (TM^2). - Similarly, the power of point (T) with respect to circle ((NCP)) is (TN^2). 5. **Equality of Powers:** - Given that (T) is the midpoint of ([MN]), it follows that (TM = TN). - Therefore, the powers of (T) with respect to both circumcircles are equal: (TM^2 = TN^2). 6. **Radical Axis:** - The radical axis theorem states that the locus of points that have equal power with respect to two circles is a line, known as the radical axis. - Points (P) and (X) are known intersections of the two circumcircles; they must lie on this radical axis. 7. **Conclusion:** - Since (T) lies on the radical axis, and both (X) and (P) lie on this line, the points (T), (X), and (P) are collinear. Therefore, the line (XP) passes through the midpoint (T) of ([MN]). [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"a pond there are 20 frogs and some crocodiles. The total number of animal eyes is 52.

The piece starts in the middle cell, which is marked either ( L ) or ( R ). - If the middle cell is marked ( L ), the piece moves to the left end cell in the next step. - If the middle cell is marked ( R ), the piece moves to the right end cell in the next step. - In both cases, the piece reaches an end cell in one step, so the number of operations is finite. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement is true for ( n = k ). That is, for any configuration of ( k+2 ) cells, the piece will reach an end cell in a finite number of steps. - Consider ( n = k+1 ). There are ( k+3 ) cells.

Suppose ( A_i = R ) (the other case is similar). Consider any possible valid move: suppose it takes the token to ( j ) (( j > i )). After this move, ( A_i ) gets changed to ( L ). We have ( A_j = L ). Thus, this is a good configuration. - From any good configuration, there exists a move to a bad configuration: - Let ((A, i)) be a good configuration. Suppose ( A_i = R ) (the other case is similar). Let ( j ) be the largest index such that ( A_j = R ). Since this is a good configuration, ( j > i ). Consider the move which takes the token to ( j ).

This means the graph of the function is situated in the first and third quadrants of the coordinate plane. In these quadrants, as x increases, y decreases due to the nature of inverse proportionality. Let's analyze the options given: 1. **For x_{1} < x_{2} < 0:** Both points A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}) are in the third quadrant because x_{1} and x_{2} are both negative. In this quadrant, as x increases (moves from x_{1} to x_{2}), y decreases. Therefore, we have y_{2} < y_{1} < 0. 2. **For 0 < x_{1} < x_{2}:** Both points A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}) are in the first quadrant because x_{1} and x_{2} are both positive. In this quadrant, as x increases (moves from x_{1} to x_{2}), y decreases. Therefore, we have y_{2} < y_{1}. 3. **For x_{1} < 0 < x_{2}:** Point A(x_{1}, y_{1}) is in the third quadrant (since x_{1} < 0), and point B(x_{2}, y_{2}) is in the first quadrant (since x_{2} > 0). In the third quadrant, as x moves towards zero, y decreases and becomes less negative (approaches zero from below). In the first quadrant, as x moves away from zero, y decreases from a positive value. Therefore, in this case, y_{1} < y_{2}. Given the analysis above, we can conclude that: - Option A is incorrect because it suggests y_{1} < y_{2} when x_{1} < x_{2}, which is not always true. - Option B is incorrect because it suggests y_{2} < y_{1} when x_{1} < x_{2}, which is true for x_{1}, x_{2} > 0 and x_{1}, x_{2} < 0, but not when x_{1} < 0 < x_{2}. - Option D is incorrect because it suggests y_{2} < y_{1} when x_{1} < 0 < x_{2}, which contradicts the nature of the inverse proportion function across different quadrants.

In this case, we want the output of the logarithm (before subtracting 1) to be 0, since subtracting 1 from 0 gives us -1, which is a potential y-value given in the options.

Since B is on y-axis: theta = 180^circ - 30^circ = 150^circ or a reflection of A in the y-axis: 30^circ+180^circ = 210^circ. **Case 3: CA=CB** A, B symmetry around C implies theta = 90^circ + (90^circ-30^circ)/2 = 120^circ and theta = 90^circ - (90^circ-30^circ)/2 = 60^circ. Summing potential unique theta values: 150^circ, 210^circ, 120^circ, 60^circ results in 150 + 210 + 120 + 60 = 540. Thus, the sum of all possible values of theta is 540.

Substituting the parametric equations of line l into the standard equation of circle C, we have: (tcos(α) - 1)^{2} + (tsin(α))^{2} = 5 Simplifying this expression leads to: t^{2} - 2tcos(α) - 4 = 0 Denote the parameters corresponding to points M and N as t_{1} and t_{2}, then t_{1} + t_{2} = 2cos(α).

Let's proceed step-by-step to solve this equation. Step 1: Rewrite the equation We start by rewriting the given equation: [ frac{x+y}{z} = frac{x! + y!}{z!} ] Multiplying both sides by (z z!) to clear the denominators, we get: [ (x + y) z! = z (x! + y!) ] Re-organizing, this can be written as: [ (x + y)(z - 1)! = x! + y! ] Step 2: Analyzing the cases **Case 1: (z > x) and (z > y)** If ( z > x ) and ( z > y ), then (( z - 1)! > x!) and ((z - 1)! > y!), therefore: [ x! + y! leq 2(z-1)! ] So, we get: [ (x + y)(z-1)!=x! + y! leq 2(z-1)! ] This implies: [ x + y leq 2 ] Since (x), (y), and (z) are natural numbers, the possibilities for (x + y leq 2) are: 1. (x = 1) and (y = 1) 2. (x = 2) and (y = 0) 3. (x = 0) and (y = 2) However, factorials for (0) are not considered natural numbers here. Hence the only valid pair is ((x, y) = (1, 1)).

We start with a 9x9 chessboard which is colored in a checkerboard pattern, with the upper left corner starting with a black cell. 2. **Determine cell types**: - A black cell on this board happens if both coordinates are either even or both are odd. - This separates the black cells into two classes: - Cells with both even coordinates (E,E). - Cells with both odd coordinates (O,O). 3. **Constraints on placing rooks (rooks attack any cell in the same row or column)**: - Any rook positioned on (E,E) cells can only attack other black cells in rows and columns with even indices. - Similarly, any rook positioned on (O,O) cells can only attack other black cells in rows and columns with odd indices. 4. **Define potential rook placements**: - This checkerboard configuration results in two smaller virtual boards: - **4x4 Board**: Corresponding to the (E,E) cells. - **5x5 Board**: Corresponding to the (O,O) cells. 5. **Counting non-attacking rook arrangements**: - **4x4 Board**: We need to place 4 non-attacking rooks, which can be done in (4!) ways. - **5x5 Board**: We need to place 5 non-attacking rooks, which can be done in (5!) ways. 6. **Calculate the total number of ways to place the rooks**: [ 4! times 5! = 24 times 120 = 2880 ] 7. **Verify without white cells**: - Any white cell has coordinates where one is odd and the other is even. - Maximum rooks on a 9x9 board with such white cell properties would be constrained by either rows or columns, leading to at most **4 rooks per direction**.

We need to determine if the final product can be exactly 15 times the initial product. 2. **Initial Products**: Assume the five natural numbers are ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 ). Thus, their product can be expressed as: [ P = a_1 cdot a_2 cdot a_3 cdot a_4 cdot a_5 ] 3. **Modified Numbers**: When each number is reduced by 3, the new numbers are ( a_1 - 3, a_2 - 3, a_3 - 3, a_4 - 3, a_5 - 3 ). The new product becomes: [ P' = (a_1 - 3) cdot (a_2 - 3) cdot (a_3 - 3) cdot (a_4 - 3) cdot (a_5 - 3) ] 4. **Desired Condition**: We need ( P' ) to be 15 times the initial product ( P ): [ P' = 15P ] 5. **Concrete Example**: Let’s verify this with a specific set of numbers: - Choose ( 1, 1, 1, 1, 48 ).

By repositioning the cut pieces after each cut, how much can you reduce the number of cuts?","completion":"To address the problem of slicing a wooden cube with an edge of length 40 cm into 64 smaller cubes with edges of 10 cm each by making the minimum number of cuts, consider the following steps: 1. Understand the structure: - The large cube is 40 , text{cm} times 40 , text{cm} times 40 , text{cm} - The small cubes are each 10 , text{cm} times 10 , text{cm} times 10 , text{cm} - Since 40 div 10 = 4, the large cube contains 4 times 4 times 4 = 64 smaller cubes. 2. Make cuts without shifting any pieces: - To split the large cube into smaller cubes while minimizing the number of cuts and not moving any pieces, cuts must be done along the three dimensions. - Conventional cutting plans propose 9 slices total: 3 cuts per dimension. 3. Optimize by moving pieces: - Upon making cuts, moving pieces allows each cut to impact more uncut sections: - We realize a cut along one dimension splits the initial block entirely (say along x-axis), resulting in two large blocks of 40 , text{cm} times 40 , text{cm} times 20 , text{cm}. - A subsequent cut along the perpendicular dimension (y-axis) further splits each block. 4. Proof of minimum cuts using permutations: - If each cut maximally divides the current uncut sections into two, our cutting scheme's efficacy increases. - After three such axis-aligned cuts: - One along each dimension x, y, and z. - Each cut subjects the resulting blocks to further subdivision. 5. Minimum calculation verification: - We start with 1 large block; - First cut: 1 rightarrow 2 - Second cut: 2 rightarrow 4 - Third cut: 4 rightarrow 8 - Continue the pattern, - Next dimension splits: 8 rightarrow 16 - Fifth dimension cut: 16 rightarrow 32, and finally the last cut: - Sixth cut: 32 rightarrow 64 cubes - Therefore, it demands 6 cuts: - Confirmed as each subdivision targets axis-aligned component sections. # Conclusion: Through thorough and optimal slicing while rearranging uncut sections at intervals, the total effective number of cuts is minimized to 6.
