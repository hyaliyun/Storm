A permutation is called bad if in it you can find 10 numbers (not necessarily consecutive) that are in descending order. The remaining permutations are called good. Prove that the number of good arrangements does not exceed 81^n. # Detailed Solution: 1. **Goal and Strategy**: The first step is to prove that if a permutation is good, then the sequence can be colored using nine colors such that every number of the same color appears in increasing order. **Statement**: We need to prove a good arrangement can be colored using at most 9 colors ensuring that the numbers with the same color remain in increasing order. 2. **Coloring Process**: Color the numbers from left to right using the smallest number color ensuring the numbers previously colored with the same color are less than the current number. - **Assumption**: Assume that nine colors are insufficient. - **Proof by Contradiction**: Since we cannot use the 9th color, there must exist a larger number already colored with each of the first 8 colors prior to this number needing the 9th color. 3. **Descending Order Result**: For each of the 8 previous colors, there is a larger number, which leads to finding 10 numbers that follow a descending order, contradicting the fact that the permutation is good. Thus, a good permutation can indeed be colored using 9 colors. 4. **Calculation of Good Permutations**: - Each number from 1 to n can be assigned 9 colors: 9^n ways. - Each position of 1 to n can be colored by 9 colors: 9^n ways. Therefore, there are at most (9^n) times (9^n) = (9^2)^n = 81^n ways to color the numbers and places such that they form a good permutation. **Conclusion**: Hence, the number of good permutations does not exceed 81^n. boxed{81^n}"},{"prompt":"Do there exist natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( m^2 = n^2 + 2014 )?","completion":"To determine whether there exist natural numbers m and n such that m^2 = n^2 + 2014, we approach the problem through the following detailed steps: 1. **Rewriting the Equation**: Start by rewriting the given equation: [ m^2 = n^2 + 2014 ] This can be rearranged to express it as a difference of squares: [ m^2 - n^2 = 2014 ] 2. **Factoring the Difference of Squares**: We know from algebra that the difference of squares can be factored as follows: [ m^2 - n^2 = (m - n)(m + n) = 2014 ] 3. **Analyzing the Parity**: Since 2014 is an even number, we move forward to check the parity of m and n. Both (m - n) and (m + n) must be integers of the same parity because adding or subtracting two integers of the same parity always results in an even number.

All other factor pairs will follow a similar result due to all introducing an odd factor into the mix. 4. **Verification through Modular Arithmetic**: Another approach is to verify using modular arithmetic if m^2 - n^2 = 2014 can hold. Considering the quadratic residues modulo 4: [ 0^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad 1^2 equiv 1 pmod{4} ] Therefore, m^2 and n^2 can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.

Prove that Vasya can choose 90 computers in such a way that if he uploads the virus to them simultaneously, the entire network will be infected within 10 minutes.","completion":"1. **Modeling the Problem:** Let's represent each computer as a vertex in a graph, and the connections (wires) between them as edges. According to the problem, the network is such that if a virus is uploaded to any computer, eventually the entire network will be infected. This implies that the graph is connected, as all vertices are accessible from any other vertex. 2. **Graph Theoretical Concepts:** - **Path and Cycle:** A sequence of vertices where every two consecutive vertices are connected by an edge is called a path. A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any other vertices is called a cycle. - **Tree:** A connected acyclic graph (no cycles) is called a tree. Given any connected graph, it's possible to remove edges to get a tree (spanning tree) while ensuring the graph remains connected but without cycles. 3. **Transition to a Spanning Tree:** From the connected graph of 1000 vertices, we will construct a spanning tree by successively removing edges involved in cycles. A spanning tree for a graph with 1000 vertices will have 999 edges, maintaining connectivity without cycles. 4. **Analyzing the Longest Path:** Consider the longest path in the tree we obtained. Let's denote this path as (X - A_1 - A_2 - ldots - A_k - Y), where (X) and (Y) are the endpoints of this path and (A_i) are internal vertices on this path. 5. **Case Analysis Based on Path Length k:** - **Case 1: ( k leq 19 )** If the length (k) of the path is at most 19, we infect the vertex (A_{10}) (or any vertex if there are less than 10 vertices). Given that our longest path is 19 or fewer vertices long, all vertices are within 10 steps from (A_{10}).

Infecting (A_{10}) ensures that within 10 minutes, all vertices on the path from (X) to (A_{10}) and (A_{10}) to (Y) are infected, as the tree structure ensures that vertices are no more than 10 steps away. 6. **Reduction Strategy:** In each step, we infect the middle vertex of the longest path and divide the graph into smaller segments, recursively applying the process. After 89 iterations, we will have at most 21 remaining vertices (since (89 times 11 = 979) and (1000 - 979 = 21)). We repeat the same infection strategy for these remaining vertices. 7. **Final Step:** By inductively applying the process, we ensure the virus spreads across all segments of the network within 10 minutes by carefully selecting the starting infected vertices such that every segment of the network gets infected progressively. **Conclusion:** Vasya can select 90 computers (vertices) such that if the virus is uploaded to them simultaneously, the entire Pentagon’s computer network will be infected within 10 minutes.

For ( i neq j ), we have: [ E_{i,k} = E_{i,j} cdot E_{j,k} quad text{and} quad 0 = E_{j,k} cdot E_{i,j} ] Applying ( f ) to these, we get: [ f(E_{i,k}) = f(E_{i,j} cdot E_{j,k}) = f(0) = 0 quad text{for} quad i neq k ] 3. **Diagonal Matrix ( C )**: This implies that ( C ) must be a diagonal matrix because ( f(E_{i,k}) = 0 ) for ( i neq k ). 4. **Form of ( C )**: Let ( C = text{diag}(lambda_1, lambda_2, ldots, lambda_n) ). Then, [ f(A) = text{Tr}(AC) = sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i a_{i,i} ] 5. **Equality of Diagonal Elements**: Since ( f(AB) = f(BA) ) for all ( A, B ), consider ( A = E_{i,i} ) and ( B = E_{j,j} ): [ f(E_{i,i} E_{j,j}) = f(E_{j,j} E_{i,i}) implies f(0) = f(0) ] This does not provide new information. Instead, consider ( A = E_{i,i} ) and ( B ) as any diagonal matrix: [ f(E_{i,i} B) = f(B E_{i,i}) implies lambda_i b_{i,i} = lambda_i b_{i,i} ] This holds trivially. To ensure ( lambda_i ) are the same, consider ( A = I ) (identity matrix): [ f(I) = sum_{i=1}^n lambda_i ] Since ( f ) is linear and ( f(AB) = f(BA) ), it implies ( lambda_i = lambda ) for all ( i ). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( C = lambda I ) for some ( lambda in mathbb{R} ), and [ f(A) = lambda text{Tr}(A) ] The final answer is ( boxed{ f(A) = lambda text{Tr}(A) } )"},{"prompt":"A parabola has the following optical properties: a light ray passing through the focus of the parabola and reflecting off the parabola will result in a light ray parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola; conversely, an incident light ray parallel to the axis of symmetry of the parabola will, after reflecting off the parabola, pass through the focus of the parabola. Given that the focus of the parabola y^{2}=4x is F, a light ray parallel to the xaxis is emitted from point A(5,4), reflects off point B on the parabola, and then exits through another point C on the parabola. Find the value of |BC|.","completion":"To solve this problem, we follow a step-by-step approach based on the given solution: 1. **Identify the Focus of the Parabola**: Given the equation of the parabola y^{2}=4x, we can deduce the focus F of the parabola. The standard form of a parabola's equation is y^2=4ax, where a is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Therefore, for y^{2}=4x, we have a=1, which means the focus F is at (1,0). 2. **Find Point B on the Parabola**: The light ray emitted from point A(5,4) is parallel to the x-axis, which means it has an equation of y=4. Substituting y=4 into the equation of the parabola y^{2}=4x, we find the x-coordinate of point B on the parabola: [ 4^2 = 4x implies x = 4 ] Therefore, point B is at (4,4). 3. **Determine the Slope of Line BF**: The slope of the line connecting points B(4,4) and F(1,0) is calculated as follows: [ k_{BF} = frac{4 - 0}{4 - 1} = frac{4}{3} ] 4. **Equation of Line BF**: With the slope k_{BF} = frac{4}{3} and passing through point F(1,0), the equation of line BF can be written as: [ x = frac{3}{4}y + 1 ] 5. **Solve the System of Equations**: We solve the system of equations consisting of the parabola y^{2}=4x and the line x=frac{3}{4}y+1: [ left{begin{array}{l} x=frac{3}{4}y+1 y^{2}=4x end{array}right. ] Substituting x from the first equation into the second gives us: [ y^{2} = 4left(frac{3}{4}y + 1right) implies y^{2} - 3y - 4 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find y = 4 or y = -1. Since y=4 corresponds to point B, we use y=-1 to find point C. 6. **Find Point C on the Parabola**: Substituting y=-1 into the parabola's equation y^{2}=4x, we find: [ (-1)^2 = 4x implies x = frac{1}{4} ] Therefore, point C is at left(frac{1}{4}, -1right). 7. **Calculate |BC|**: The distance between points B(4,4) and Cleft(frac{1}{4}, -1right) is calculated using the distance formula: [ |BC| = sqrt{left(4 - frac{1}{4}right)^2 + (4 + 1)^2} = sqrt{left(frac{15}{4}right)^2 + 5^2} = sqrt{frac{225}{16} + frac{400}{16}} = sqrt{frac{625}{16}} = frac{25}{4} ] Therefore, the length of |BC| is boxed{frac{25}{4}}."},{"prompt":"a convex quadrilateral ABCD we are given that angle CAD=10^circ , angle DBC=20^circ , angle BAD=40^circ , angle ABC=50^circ .

They bought two basketballs for 40 each, so they spent 2 * 40 = 80 on basketballs. They also bought 20 bottles of energy drinks for 2 each, so they spent 20 * 2 = 40 on energy drinks.

What is the maximum number of positive numbers that can be among these 100 written integers?","completion":"To address the problem, we need to investigate the condition that each number written in the circle is greater than the product of the two numbers immediately following it. Step 1: Assumption for Contradiction - Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that two consecutive numbers can both be positive. Let's denote these two consecutive positive numbers by (a) and (b). - We know (a) is greater than the product of the two numbers immediately following it, and (b) follows (a), hence (a > b cdot x) where (x) is the number following (b) in the clockwise direction. Step 2: Derive Implications - Since (a) and (b) are both positive, their product (a cdot b) is also positive. - The number preceding (a) in the counterclockwise direction must also be positive for (a) to be larger than the product of the two following numbers. - Therefore, if continuously considered, all numbers would have to be positive and ordered such that they increase according to the stipulated logic, leading to a scenario where, counterclockwise, all the numbers keep increasing without bounds. Step 3: Ensuring Consistency with Logic - However, given the finite nature of the 100 numbers and the circular structure, such continually increasing sequence is impossible. This contradiction suggests that not all pairs can consist of positive numbers. Step 4: Pair Analysis - This realization means that at least one number in every pair of consecutive numbers must be negative to satisfy the given condition. Step 5: Calculation of Maximum Positive Numbers - As the list contains 100 numbers and we've established that each pair must have at least one negative number, at least half of the numbers must be negative. - Dividing the 100 numbers into 50 pairs, each containing at least one negative number, we find that at most 50 numbers can be positive. Step 6: Construct an Example - Consider 50 pairs, each consisting of one positive and one negative number, for example, alternating between (2) and (-2). # Conclusion: Hence, the maximum number of positive numbers that can be written among the 100 numbers is: boxed{50}"},{"prompt":"f the point (3,6) is on the graph of y=g(x), and h(x)=(g(x))^2 for all x, then there is one point that must be on the graph of y=h(x).

The sine function sin(2x) has a period of frac{2pi}{2} = pi, and since sin(x) is an odd function, -sin(2x) is also odd. Therefore, this function is both odd and has a period of pi. C: y=sin 2x+cos 2x: The function is a sum of sin(2x) and cos(2x), which both have periods of pi. However, this function is neither even nor odd, as it does not satisfy the properties of f(-x)=f(x) for an even function nor f(-x)=-f(x) for an odd function. D: y=sin x+cos x: The function is a sum of sin(x) and cos(x), which both have periods of 2pi. Like option C, this function is neither even nor odd, as it does not meet the parity criteria.

The problem is to state that for any integer (a) that is coprime with (n), the following relation holds: [ a^{varphi(n)} equiv 1 (text{mod} n) ] Here, (varphi(n)) is the Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers up to (n) that are coprime with (n). 2. **Euler's Totient Function Definition and Use:** Euler's totient function, (varphi(n)), is defined as: [ varphi(n) = n left(1 - frac{1}{p_1}right)left(1 - frac{1}{p_2}right)cdotsleft(1 - frac{1}{p_k}right) ] where (p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k) are the distinct prime numbers dividing (n). 3. **Applying Fermat's Little Theorem:** Fermat's Little Theorem states that if ( p ) is a prime number and ( a ) is any integer not divisible by ( p ), then: [ a^{p-1} equiv 1 (text{mod} p) ] 4. **Generalizing to Euler’s Totient Function:** For any integer ( n ) and ( a ) such that (gcd(a,n)=1), we use a generalization of Fermat’s theorem. The generalization says: [ a^{varphi(n)} equiv 1 (text{mod} n) ] 5. **Proof Outline:** - If (n) is prime, (varphi(n) = n-1), and Fermat’s Little Theorem gives (a^{n-1} equiv 1 (text{mod} n)). - For (n) not prime, we use the multiplicative group of integers modulo (n), denoted ((mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z})^*). The order of this group is (varphi(n)). Since (a) is in ((mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z})^*) and by properties of finite groups, [ a^{varphi(n)} equiv 1 (text{mod} n) ] # Conclusion: The detailed step-by-step verification using the properties of Euler's totient function and the multiplicative group ((mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z})^*) confirms the theorem.

To find 10^{-1} pmod{997}, we compute the multiplicative inverse of 10 modulo 997. That is, we need to find x such that: 10x equiv 1 pmod{997}. Using the observation above, 100 cdot 10 equiv 3, we multiply both sides by the integer that converts 3 into 1 modulo 997. Since 3 cdot 333 = 999 equiv 2 pmod{997}, we multiply by another 3 to get: 3 cdot 3 cdot 100 cdot 10 equiv 9 pmod{997}, and we need 999 equiv 2 pmod{997}, so we multiply by 166 (since 166 cdot 6 equiv 1 pmod{997}) to find: 166 cdot 9 cdot 100 cdot 10 equiv 1 pmod{997}.

We need to show by induction on n that in a convex n-gon, it is not possible to select more than n diagonals such that any two of them share a common vertex. 2. **Base Case: n = 3** For a triangle (3-gon), it is trivially true. There are no diagonals in a triangle, and any two sides share a common vertex. Therefore, the statement holds for n = 3. 3. **Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement is true for any convex n-gon, i.e., in a convex n-gon, it is not possible to select more than n diagonals such that any two of them share a common vertex. We need to prove it for a convex (n+1)-gon. 4. Consider a convex (n+1)-gon. Suppose for contradiction that we have chosen more than n+1 sides or diagonals such that any two of them share a common vertex. 5. If from each vertex of the (n+1)-gon, at most two selected sides or diagonals emerge, then the total number of selected sides or diagonals is at most 2 times frac{(n+1)}{2} = n+1. Thus, to have more than n+1 selected sides or diagonals, there must be at least one vertex (say A) from which at least three selected sides or diagonals emerge. 6. Let the three selected sides or diagonals from vertex A be AB_{1}, AB_{2}, and AB_{3}, where AB_{2} lies between AB_{1} and AB_{3}. 7. Any diagonal or side emerging from point B_{2}, which is different from AB_{2}, cannot simultaneously intersect both AB_{1} and AB_{3}. This implies that only one selected side or diagonal can emerge from B_{2}. 8. Thus, we can remove the vertex B_{2} along with the diagonal AB_{2} and apply the induction hypothesis on the remaining n-gon. According to our induction hypothesis, in the remaining n-gon, the number of selected sides or diagonals such that any two of them share a common vertex must be fewer than or equal to n. 9. Since removing vertex B_{2} and AB_{2} leaves an n-gon with n or fewer chosen sides or diagonals, adding back AB_{2} still results in n+1 diagonals or sides, which is within our bound. 10. Therefore, we have shown that it's impossible to select more than n+1 diagonals or sides from a convex (n+1)-gon such that any two of them share a common vertex, completing our induction step.

We want to find a power of 2 that, when subtracted by ( 2^{29} ), gives us a number that has 31 as its greatest prime factor.

Notice this result simplifies to a differential equation: [ f'(x) = f(x) - x ] 8. To solve this differential equation, we use the integrating factor method: The differential equation can be written as: [ f'(x) - f(x) = -x ] The integrating factor is: [ e^{-x} ] Multiplying through by the integrating factor: [ e^{-x} f'(x) - e^{-x} f(x) = - x e^{-x} ] 9.

From the identity for the product of the roots, we get: [ xy = frac{(x + y)^2 - (x^2 + y^2)}{2} = frac{t^2 - 4}{2} ] Therefore, the expression ( xy - 4(x + y) - 2 ) becomes: [ xy - 4(x + y) - 2 = frac{t^2 - 4}{2} - 4t - 2 ] 4. Simplifying the above: [ frac{t^2 - 4}{2} - 4t - 2 = frac{t^2}{2} - 2 - 4t - 2 = frac{t^2}{2} - 4t - 4 ] 5. We need to find the minimum value of the quadratic expression ( frac{t^2}{2} - 4t - 4 ).

To reflect this in terms of ( p_1 ): - The probability ( p_2 ) (for the second player) can be considered as ( frac{35}{36} p_1 ). - Similarly, for the ( k )-th player, we have ( p_{k+1} = frac{35}{36} p_k ). 5. This implies that each subsequent player's probability of winning is reduced by a factor of ( frac{35}{36} ) compared to the previous player. From the above steps, we can observe that the probability of winning is dependent on the position of the player. Therefore, we conclude that: [ text{The game is not fair as the probability of winning is not equal for all players.} ] [ boxed{text{No}} ] Part (b) 1. Let's generalize the problem by considering ( n ) players drawing from a deck with ( n ) cards. 2.

Recognizing the series as a geometric series with the ratio ( r = left( frac{n-1}{n} right)^n ): [ p_1 = frac{1}{n} cdot frac{1}{1 - left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^n} = frac{1}{n} cdot frac{1}{1 - expleft(-frac{1}{e}right)} ] where ( left( 1 - frac{1}{n} right)^n approx frac{1}{e} ) for large values of ( n ). 4. Substituting ( e approx 2.718 ): [ p_1 approx frac{1}{n} cdot left( 1 - frac{1}{e} right)^{-1} = frac{e}{n(e-1)} ] 5.

The problem can be visualized and simplified using graph theory. 2. **Graph Representation**: Consider each hexagonal field as a vertex in a graph, and each move of the camel as an edge connecting two vertices. Thus, the hexagonal board or the scheme in Figure 21 can be represented by a graph. 3. **Graph Properties**: According to the problem, we can focus on an equivalent graph shown in Figure 22, which looks like a directed graph with 25 points. Further simplification of the problem involves another alternative representation shown in Figure 23, which consists of fields of two types: octagons and squares. 4. **Coloring of Fields**: Consider a proper coloring of the board (as derived from the board examples in Figures 19, 20, and 22): - There are 21 black fields. - There are 21 white fields. - There are 19 red fields. Fields are arranged such that no two adjacent fields share the same color. 5. **Traversal Constraints**: The camel starts at a certain field and each move must adhere to the coloring constraints: a step from one field to another must alternate colors based on the adjacency rules. This simplifies to: a valid traversal is one where the camel follows a path characterized by alternating colors of the fields. 6. **Final Move and Color Parity**: The last move of the camel needs to return it to a field of the same color as the starting field.

Note that the inequality can be rewritten in the form: [ a_{n+1} leqslant max{a_n, a_{n-1}} ] 3. Define b_n = max{a_{n-1}, a_n} for n geq 2. It follows that: [ b_{n+1} = max{a_n, a_{n+1}} leqslant max{a_n, a_{n-1}} = b_n ] 4. Thus, {b_n} is a non-increasing sequence of positive numbers (since all a_n are positive).

Now, we proceed to show that lim_{n to infty} a_n = beta. 6. Since 0 < a_n leqslant b_n for all n geq 2, if beta = 0, it is evident that: [ lim_{n to infty} a_n = beta = 0 ] 7. Suppose beta > 0.

Assume there exists an n > n_0 + 1 such that: [ a_n leqslant beta - varepsilon ] 11. By the definition of b_n and the assumption, we get: [ a_{n-1} leqslant max{a_{n-1}, a_n} = b_n < beta + frac{varepsilon}{2} ] 12.

How many integers less than 2000 can be displayed on the screen after a finite number of operations? : 1. To determine if it is possible to display the integer 2000 on the screen. Let's denote the starting number as x_0 = 1. We need to investigate if 2000 can be obtained through a sequence of operations, either leftlfloor frac{x}{2} rightrfloor or 4x + 1. 1. **Step-by-step Operations Analysis:** The second button is of form 4x + 1.

For simplification, we realize that the first operation inherently reduces larger x into smaller. 3. **Using constraints mod 4** to check feasibility: The second operation grows rapidly with approximating: [ 4^n + 1 = 2000 ] Checking modulo constraints to verify: 2000 mod 4 = 0 Checks whether a misalignment is influenced: Continuing recursive steps and finding residue growth: After processing through: The steps rely on general restriction via non alignment. 4. **Conclusion:** It's verified to outline misalignment mod constraints constant checks, If proven consistent growth till no forced breaks, confirmed can be projected.

If there were originally 220 boarders, we can set up a proportion to find the number of day students: 5/12 = 220/day students To find the number of day students, we cross-multiply and solve for the day students: 5 * day students = 12 * 220 day students = (12 * 220) / 5 day students = 2640 / 5 day students = 528 So, originally there were 528 day students.

How many more dollars does a pint of strawberries cost when not on sale compared to a pint of blueberries when not on sale?","completion":"Let's first calculate the original price of a pint of strawberries before the sale. If the supermarket made 280 from selling 70 pints of strawberries at the sale price, which was 30% less than the original price, we can set up the following equation to find the original price: Let ( x ) be the original price of a pint of strawberries before the sale. The sale price is then ( x - 0.30x = 0.70x ). The revenue from the sale price is ( 70 times 0.70x = 280 ). So, ( 49x = 280 ). Now, solve for ( x ): ( x = frac{280}{49} ). ( x = 5.71 ) (rounded to two decimal places). This means the original price of a pint of strawberries was 5.71. Now, let's calculate the original price of a pint of blueberries before the sale. If the supermarket made 200 from selling 50 pints of blueberries at the sale price, which was 20% less than the original price, we can set up the following equation to find the original price: Let ( y ) be the original price of a pint of blueberries before the sale. The sale price is then ( y - 0.20y = 0.80y ). The revenue from the sale price is ( 50 times 0.80y = 200 ). So, ( 40y = 200 ). Now, solve for ( y ): ( y = frac{200}{40} ). ( y = 5 ). This means the original price of a pint of blueberries was 5. Now, to find out how many more dollars a pint of strawberries costs when not on sale compared to a pint of blueberries when not on sale, we subtract the original price of blueberries from the original price of strawberries: ( 5.71 - 5 = 0.71 ). So, a pint of strawberries costs boxed{0.71} more when not on sale compared to a pint of blueberries when not on sale."},{"prompt":"Let left(u_{n}right) be the real sequence such that u_{0}=3 and u_{n+1}=sqrt{2+u_{n}}.

The problem reduces to showing that each point in A is precisely an endpoint of exactly two segments, hence forming pairs in P. 1. **Degree Condition**: We denote the degree (the number of segments connected to a_i) as d_i for each i. According to the problem, the sum of the degrees of all points is equal to twice the number of segments, hence: [ sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 2 times |P| = 2n ] 2. **Triple Intersection Group Analysis**: Let's analyze the triple intersections. If a point a_k is a common endpoint of two segments (p_i, p_j), then the set {a_k, p_i, p_j} forms a triangle. Here, the total number of such triangles can be counted as: [ S = sum_{i=1}^n binom{d_i}{2} ] 3. **Counting From Segments Pairs**: On the other hand, since every pair {a_i, a_j} forms a segment where a common point is considered, the number of such triangles S is also equivalent to the number of segments: [ S = n ] 4. **Degree Sum and Its Implications**: Using the above information, we see: [ n = sum_{i=1}^n binom{d_i}{2} ] Expanding and simplifying: [ n = sum_{i=1}^n frac{d_i(d_i - 1)}{2} = frac{1}{2} left( sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2 - sum_{i=1}^n d_i right) ] 5. **Simplifying Using the Known Sum**: We know from the degree sum that sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 2n. Plugging this in: [ n = frac{1}{2} left( sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2 - 2n right) ] 6. **Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**: We apply Cauchy-Schwarz (or direct calculation for equality conditions): [ left(sum_{i=1}^n d_iright)^2 leq n sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2 ] Giving: [ (2n)^2 leq n sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2 implies 4n^2 leq n sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2 implies 4n leq sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2 ] Substituting back: [ n = frac{1}{2} left(sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2 - 2n right) geq frac{1}{2} left( 4n - 2n right) = n ] 7. **Equality Condition**: The inequality becomes equality when all d_i are equal. Given the degree sum: [ d_1 = d_2 = cdots = d_n = 2 ] This means each point in A is the endpoint of exactly two segments in P.

We need to show that if the sums of the opposite sides are equal, i.e., [ AB + CD = AD + BC, ] then a circle can be inscribed in ABCD. 2. **Refer to previous problems and theorems**: According to the Tangent Secant Theorem and properties of a tangential quadrilateral (one that can have an inscribed circle), the condition for the existence of an inscribed circle in a quadrilateral is that the sums of the lengths of the opposite sides are equal. 3. **Use Geometry**: In this problem, we need to use the converse of the theorem mentioned. We need to show that equal sums of opposite sides imply the existence of a tangential circle in a convex quadrilateral. 4. **Visual Representation and Initial Setup**: Draw a circle that touches three sides of the quadrilateral, say AB, BC, CD. Let this circle touch these sides at P, Q, R respectively. 5. **Key Insight and Calculation**: According to the given conditions for the quadrilateral ABCD, if we assume that: - The circle touches AB at P, - BC at Q, - CD at R, - We need to prove it also touches DA. 6. **Mathematical Expression**: From the properties of tangential quadrilateral, we know: [ AB + CD = AD + BC, ] This equality implies that when a circle touches the sides of the quadrilateral, the segments from the vertices to the tangency points create equal sum conditions: - Let segments AP = AS = x (where P and S are tangent points on AB and AD respectively), - Let BP = BQ = y, CQ = CR = z, DR = DS = w. Therefore: [ AB = x + y, quad BC = y + z, quad CD = z + w, quad AD = w + x. ] 7. **Validation of Tangent Sums**: Sum of opposite sides: [ AB + CD = (x + y) + (z + w) = x + y + z + w, ] [ AD + BC = (w + x) + (y + z) = w + x + y + z. ] So, [ AB + CD = AD + BC. ] 8. **Constructing the Conclusion**: Even with the circle touching three sides, if three sides obey the tangent circle property, the fourth side naturally adjusts to allow the circle to be tangent by the symmetric and the previously established theorem. Therefore, a circle that touches three sides will necessitate touching the fourth side due to the equality of sum of the lengths of opposite sides.

Let's go through the detailed steps to prove this: 1. **Possible Remainders**: - When performing long division of 41 by 61, we know that the remainders can only be any integer from 1 to 60. This is because when dividing by 61, the maximum remainder can be 60 (if a remainder of 0 occurs, the decimal ends, but we are focusing on the infinite decimal case). 2. **Pigeonhole Principle**: - According to the pigeonhole principle, since there are 61 possible steps (including remainders) in the process of division, and only 60 possible remainders, at least one remainder must repeat within the first 61 steps of the division. This is because there are more steps than different remainders. 3. **Repetition of Remainders**: - If a remainder repeats during the division process, the entire sequence of steps will start repeating from that point onward, leading to a repeating sequence of digits in the decimal expansion. Concretely, if we encounter a remainder r at step k and the same remainder r at step k+m, the digits produced between these steps will repeat. 4. **Conclusion**: - Since a state (remainder) repeats, it implies that the decimal fraction representation of frac{41}{61} is periodic. Each cycle of digit production between the same remainders will create a repeating block of digits. Thus, the resulting decimal fraction when frac{41}{61} is expressed in its decimal form will indeed be periodic. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Anna has a pine tree in her yard that is 12frac{1}{4} feet tall and a birch tree that is 18frac{1}{2} feet tall.

This pattern suggests that the sum of roots (which is -k by Vieta's formulas) is one less than twice the larger root. For the equation x^{2}+kx+56=0, let's denote the roots as r and r-1 (consecutive roots), where r > r-1. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is -(k) = r + (r-1) = 2r - 1. The product of the roots is 56 = r(r-1).

Thus, k = -(2r - 1) = -(2*8 - 1) = -15.

We are interested in those numbers that are divisible by 3, 5, or both 3 and 5. 2. **Count Numbers Divisible by 3**: Numbers divisible by 3 from 1 to 90 form an arithmetic sequence: (3, 6, 9, ldots, 90). The general formula for the (n)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by: [ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) cdot d ] Here, (a_1 = 3), (d = 3), and (a_n = 90). Solving for (n), we have: [ 90 = 3 + (n-1) cdot 3 implies 90 = 3n implies n = frac{90}{3} = 30 ] Thus, there are 30 numbers divisible by 3. 3. **Count Numbers Divisible by 5**: Numbers divisible by 5 from 1 to 90 form an arithmetic sequence: (5, 10, 15, ldots, 90). Similarly as above: [ a_1 = 5, quad d = 5, quad a_n = 90 ] Solving for (n), we have: [ 90 = 5 + (n-1) cdot 5 implies 90 = 5n implies n = frac{90}{5} = 18 ] Thus, there are 18 numbers divisible by 5. 4. **Count Numbers Divisible by Both 3 and 5 (i.e., by 15)**: Numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., 15) from 1 to 90 form an arithmetic sequence: (15, 30, 45, ldots, 90).

Thus, we need to find how many numbers are not divisible by either 3 or 5: [ 90 - 42 = 48 ] Therefore, if we were to draw out all 48 of these numbers first, we would still not have a number divisible by 3 or 5. Drawing one more number would guarantee a number divisible by either 3 or 5. Conclusion: [ boxed{49} ]"},{"prompt":"A light flashes every 20 seconds.

Expanding and simplifying the equation, we find: a_1^2 + 8a_1 + 16 = a_1^2 + 6a_1 8. Solving for a_1, we get: 2a_1 = -16 a_1 = -8 9.

The overlapping range that satisfies both opinions is from greater than 55 kg to less than 60 kg. Now, we are given that the average of different probable weights of Karthik is 56.5 kg. Since the average is 56.5 kg, the range of weights that are probable (and that all agree upon) must be symmetric around this average. This means that the range of weights must extend equally above and below 56.5 kg. Since the lower limit of the overlapping range is just above 55 kg (as it must be greater than 55 kg), and the average is 56.5 kg, the upper limit must be an equal distance from 56.5 kg as the lower limit is below it. The distance from the lower limit (just above 55 kg) to the average (56.5 kg) is: 56.5 kg - 55 kg = 1.5 kg Therefore, the upper limit must be 1.5 kg above the average: 56.5 kg + 1.5 kg = 58 kg However, since the upper limit must be less than 60 kg according to his brother's opinion, and we've calculated an upper limit of 58 kg, which is less than 60 kg, the upper limit according to his father's opinion must be at least 58 kg.

Coffee beans consumption per day: Maddie's mom makes 2 cups of coffee per day, with each cup using 1.5 ounces of beans. 2 cups/day * 1.5 ounces/cup = 3 ounces/day 3. Coffee beans consumption per week: Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily consumption by 7 to find the weekly consumption. 3 ounces/day * 7 days/week = 21 ounces/week 4.

Let's explore the situation step-by-step: 1. **Case Assumption:** - Assume that the maximum value of N where the traveler's claim is true must be determined. 2. **Checking N geq 28:** - Suppose ( N geq 28 ). - Can we construct a scenario where less than 3 rabbits have both long ears and can jump far? 3. **Constructing a Counter Example for N geq 28:** - Let's consider ( N = 28 ). - Assume there are exactly 2 rabbits with both long ears and can jump far. - Then, the remaining divisions would be: - 11 have long ears but cannot jump far ((13 - 2 = 11)). - 15 can jump far but do not have long ears ((17 - 2 = 15)). - Other ( 0 ) rabbits are outside these groups ((28 - 28 = 0)). Thus, with ( N = 28 ), it is possible to have 2 rabbits with both traits. Therefore, ( N geq 28 ) violates the traveler’s claim. 4. **Checking N = 27:** - Now consider ( N = 27 ). - Assume no more than 2 rabbits have both long ears and can jump far. - Therefore, the rabbits can be grouped as follows: - 13 total rabbits with long ears where 11 cannot jump far. - 17 total rabbits can jump far where 15 do not have long ears. From the condition setup: [ 27 - (11 + 15) = 1 ] We see there is exactly 1 rabbit left, contradicting our assumption.

This ensures that the line Yi draws does not intersect with the pre-existing diagonal line drawn by Jia. 3. **Subsequent Strategy of Jia**: Noticing how Yi’s actions are limited to one of the halves of the polygon, Jia should continue his strategy by connecting two vertices from the other half (the part not chosen by Yi) with a line segment that does not intersect any pre-existing lines from Yi’s actions. Jia’s strategy can be identified to always pair vertices in a way that doesn't allow future lines from Yi to intersect or disrupt the division created by the first diagonal. 4. **Inductive Step**: Jia’s consistent behavior ensures that each time it is his turn, he operates in the more favorable side of the divided polygon while minimizing the intersection opportunities for Yi.

This substitution helps us write the equation more compactly and makes it easier to recognize patterns. The equation then transforms to: [ 5^{t^{2}} = a t^{2} + a^{2} - 6a + 6 ] 3. Notice that the expressions on both sides of the equation are symmetric with respect to ( t ) and ( -t ). This implies that the function ( f(t) = a t^{2} + a^{2} - 6a + 6 ) does not change if ( t ) is replaced with ( -t ).

D: Both have the origin as their vertex.","completion":"Given the parabolas y=2x^{2} and y=-2x^{2}, let's analyze the given options step by step: - **Axis of Symmetry**: For any parabola in the form y=ax^{2}+bx+c, the axis of symmetry is given by x=-frac{b}{2a}. For both y=2x^{2} and y=-2x^{2}, since b=0, the axis of symmetry for both is x=0, which is the y-axis. Therefore, option A is correct. - **Direction of Opening**: The direction in which a parabola opens is determined by the coefficient of x^{2}. If the coefficient is positive, the parabola opens upwards; if it's negative, the parabola opens downwards. Thus, y=2x^{2} opens upwards, and y=-2x^{2} opens downwards, confirming that they have opposite directions of opening. Hence, option C is correct. - **Vertex**: The vertex of a parabola in the form y=ax^{2}+bx+c is given by the point left(-frac{b}{2a}, c-frac{b^{2}}{4a}right). For both parabolas, since b=0 and c=0, the vertex is at (0,0), which is the origin. Therefore, option D is correct. - **Behavior on the Left Side of the y-axis**: For y=2x^{2}, as x becomes more negative (to the left of the y-axis), y increases because squaring a negative number results in a positive number, and multiplying by 2 keeps it positive. Thus, it is rising on the right side but decreasing on the left side as you move from left to right. For y=-2x^{2}, as x becomes more negative, y also becomes more negative, which means it is rising on the left side as you move from left to right.

Since Peter is 26 years old in 2 years, he is currently 26 - 2 = 24 years old. Now, we know that Drew is 4 years younger than Peter, so Drew is 24 - 4 = 20 years old. Since Drew is 5 years older than Maya, Maya is 20 - 5 = 15 years old. John is 30 years old, as given. Now we can find the ratio of John's age to Maya's age. John is 30 years old, and Maya is 15 years old, so the ratio is 30:15.

Since Quinton wants to plant 2 apple trees, each being 10 feet wide, the total width for the apple trees will be 2 x 10 feet = 20 feet. Additionally, there needs to be 12 feet between the apple trees. So, the total space needed for the apple trees will be 20 feet (for the trees) + 12 feet (space between) = 32 feet. Now, let's calculate the space needed for the peach trees. We know that the total space taken up by all the trees is 71 feet, and we've already accounted for 32 feet with the apple trees. This leaves us with 71 feet - 32 feet = 39 feet for the peach trees. Each peach tree will be 12 feet wide and needs 15 feet between each tree. To find out how many peach trees Quinton can plant, we need to consider the pattern of the width of a tree plus the space between them. For each additional peach tree added, we need to add 12 feet (for the tree) + 15 feet (space between) = 27 feet for each subsequent tree. Since we have 39 feet of space for the peach trees, let's see how many trees can fit: - The first peach tree will take up 12 feet of space (no space needed before it since it's the first one). - The remaining space after the first peach tree is 39 feet - 12 feet = 27 feet. Since each additional peach tree requires 27 feet (12 feet for the tree and 15 feet for the space between), and we have exactly 27 feet left, Quinton can plant one more peach tree.

There are 3 choices for the position of the digit 5 (second, third, or fourth). For any of these positions, we cannot place 1 or 2 on either side of 5.

On the other hand, the polynomial ( p(x) ) can also be expressed as ( x^{k} ) by the fundamental theorem of algebra, since its degree is less than ( n ). Therefore, for ( k < n ), the coefficient of ( x^{n-1} ) in ( x^{k} ) is 0, and when ( k = n-1 ), the coefficient of ( x^{n-1} ) is 1. 5.

Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. **Angles In Circle:** Since points (A) and (B) lie on the circle with diameter (AC), angles (angle BAE), (angle ABE), and (angle AEC) are (90^circ). This indicates that quadrilateral (ABCE) is a rectangle, hence (AB = EC) and (AE = BC). 2. **Rectangle Properties and Diagonal Analysis:** The diagonal (AC) is the diameter of the circumcircle, and since it touches (CD) at point (C), it means (angle ACD = 90^circ).

Therefore, this event is possible and does not meet the criteria for being an impossible event. - **Event B: Turning on the TV and watching the Asian Games.** This event depends on the broadcasting schedule and availability of the Asian Games on television. Since it is possible to watch the Asian Games on TV if they are being broadcasted, this event is also possible and does not meet the criteria for being an impossible event. - **Event C: Drawing a red ball from a bag that only contains white balls.** If a bag only contains white balls, then it is impossible to draw a red ball from it, as there are no red balls present in the bag to be drawn. This event is impossible, meeting the criteria for being an impossible event. - **Event D: A positive number is greater than a negative number.** By definition, any positive number is always greater than any negative number. This is a certain event, meaning it will always happen, and therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being an impossible event.

(1) Calculate the value of fleft(frac{pi}{6}right).

We can further rewrite it as: f(x) = sin left(2omega x - frac{pi}{6}right) + frac{1}{2} . Since the distance between two adjacent axes of symmetry for the graph of y=f(x) is frac{pi}{2}, this is equal to half the period of the function, i.e., frac{T}{2} = frac{pi}{2}, hence T=pi. We find the period using the expression frac{2pi}{2omega}, which gives us omega=1. Therefore, the function simplifies to: f(x) = sin left(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) + frac{1}{2} . (1) The value of fleft(frac{pi}{6}right) is: fleft(frac{pi}{6}right) = sin left(2 cdot frac{pi}{6} - frac{pi}{6}right) + frac{1}{2} = sin left(frac{pi}{6}right) + frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1 .

Anusha is the fastest on the flat track, followed by Banu and then Esha, whereas on uphill climb, Banu is faster than Anusha and Esha. On downhill, their speeds constantly change due to the slope. Anusha, Banu, and Esha maintain constant speeds during the entire flat track and uphill climb. When Anusha finishes the downhill sprint and reaches the goal post, Banu is 10 meters behind. When Banu reaches the finish line, Esha is 10 meters behind her. Calculate the distance Esha is behind Anusha when the latter reaches the goal post, considering different terrains and their varying speeds on each section of the race.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the information given and make some assumptions about the speeds of Anusha, Banu, and Esha on the different terrains. Since we don't have the exact speeds, we'll assume that the relative differences in their speeds on the flat track and uphill climb are consistent with their rankings (Anusha > Banu > Esha on flat, Banu > Anusha > Esha on uphill). Let's denote the distances covered by Anusha, Banu, and Esha on the downhill sprint when Anusha finishes as ( A_d ), ( B_d ), and ( E_d ) respectively. Given: - When Anusha finishes, Banu is 10 meters behind, so ( A_d = B_d + 10 ). - When Banu finishes, Esha is 10 meters behind her, so ( B_d = E_d + 10 ). From the first point, we know that Banu is 10 meters behind Anusha when Anusha finishes the race. This means that Banu has covered ( A_d - 10 ) meters of the downhill sprint at that time. From the second point, we know that when Banu finishes the race, Esha is 10 meters behind her. Since Banu had 10 meters left to finish when Anusha finished, Esha had ( A_d - 20 ) meters of the downhill sprint covered at the time Anusha finished.

Let's consider the given quadratic trinomial under the root, ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ). 2. To factorize the quadratic trinomial ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ), we need to find its roots using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] Here, (Delta = b^2 - 4ac) is the discriminant of the quadratic equation. 3.

Therefore, segment MN, which connects the midpoints of these two diagonals, is also perpendicular to both BD and AE. Since AD lies in the same plane as AE and is also perpendicular to BD, it is also perpendicular to MN. Thus, we have MN perp AD. For option ②: Segment MN is in plane ABCD, and BF is a line segment that lies in plane ABEF. Since planes ABCD and ABEF share line segment AB, they are not parallel planes. Therefore, line segments MN and BF are not skew lines because skew lines are found in parallel planes that do not intersect. Skew lines cannot share a common plane. Hence, this is incorrect.

So we can write the following equations: 1255 = G * k + R1 (where k is some integer) 1490 = G * m + 11 (where m is some other integer) Since G = 29, we can substitute it into the second equation to find m: 1490 = 29 * m + 11 To find m, we subtract 11 from 1490 and then divide by 29: (1490 - 11) / 29 = m 1479 / 29 = m m = 51 Now we know that 1490 is 51 times 29 plus a remainder of 11.

What is the smallest number of turns required to find the heaviest coin? <details><summary>Thanks</summary>Thanks to the user Vlados021 for translating the problem.</details>","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest number of turns required to find the heaviest coin among ( n ) coins using ( n ) balances, where one balance is faulty. 1. **Construction:** - Pick any two coins and compare them using two different balances. - If both balances show the same result (i.e., both indicate the same coin is heavier), then we can be confident about the result. We discard the lighter coin. - If the balances show different results, we compare the two coins using a third balance. Since only one balance is faulty, the third balance will give us the correct result. - We then discard the lighter coin based on the result from the third balance. - This process ensures that we can determine the heavier coin in each comparison with certainty. Since we need to compare ( n-1 ) pairs of coins to find the heaviest coin, and each comparison might require up to 2 turns (one for the initial comparison and one for the verification), the total number of turns required is ( 2(n-1) + 1 ). The additional 1 turn accounts for the final comparison when only two coins remain. 2. **Lower Bound:** - We need to show that at least ( 2n-1 ) turns are necessary. - Consider a directed graph ( G ) where vertices represent coins and a directed edge ( u to v ) indicates that coin ( u ) is heavier than coin ( v ) based on a balance comparison. - Each edge in the graph is colored based on which balance was used for the comparison. - To determine the heaviest coin, we need to ensure that each coin (except the heaviest) has an indegree of at least 2. This is because we need at least two reliable comparisons to confirm the relative weight of each coin. - If a coin ( u ) has an indegree of 1 or less, it means we have insufficient information to determine its weight relative to other coins, especially if the balance used for the comparison is faulty. - Therefore, to ensure that each coin (except the heaviest) has an indegree of at least 2, we need at least ( 2n-2 ) edges in the graph. - Since each comparison can add at most one edge to the graph, and we need to account for the possibility of a faulty balance, we need at least ( 2n-1 ) turns to ensure we have enough reliable comparisons to determine the heaviest coin. Thus, the smallest number of turns required to find the heaviest coin is ( 2n-1 ). The final answer is ( boxed{2n-1} )"},{"prompt":"The ratio of boys to girls in a kindergarten is 2:3.

At least one of the numbers rolled must be multiple of 4. 2. If not, one number must be a double even number (which makes a product involving another even number a multiple of 4). From the 10-sided die: - The multiples of 4 are 4 and 8. Thus, Maria has a frac{2}{10} = frac{1}{5} chance of rolling a multiple of 4. - The even but not multiple-of-4 numbers are 2, 6, 10. That's 3 possible rolls out of 10, giving another fraction frac{3}{10}. From the 6-sided die: - The multiples of 4 are 4. Thus, Karim has a frac{1}{6} chance of rolling a multiple of 4. - The even but not multiple-of-4 numbers are 2 and 6. That's 2 out of 6, resulting in a frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} probability. Next, we combine probabilities: - Either Maria rolls a multiple of 4 (frac{1}{5}), or Karim rolls a multiple of 4 but Maria does not roll a multiple of 4 (probability that Karim rolls a 4 and Maria rolls a non-multiple of 4 is frac{1}{6} times frac{4}{5} = frac{4}{30} = frac{2}{15}). - Maria rolls an even number (not multiple of 4) and Karim must also roll an even number (frac{3}{10} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{10}). The different overlapping cases require us to calculate cumulative probability: - Probability that either Maria or Karim rolls a multiple of 4: frac{1}{5} + frac{2}{15} - frac{2}{30} = frac{6}{30} + frac{4}{30} - frac{2}{30} = frac{8}{30} = frac{4}{15} (since product of rolls being each a multiple of 4 was double counted). - Additional probability that both roll even, thereby getting a multiple of 4 through their product of two evens: frac{1}{10}. Adding these probabilities gives frac{4}{15} + frac{1}{10} = frac{8}{30} + frac{3}{30} = frac{11}{30}.

Let's define the problem more clearly: Xiao Ming starts at point ( A ) and needs to walk along the small paths around a fountain in a square.

If both of the players write down 6 they both win otherwise they both loose. Do they have a strategy with wining chance more than frac{1}{36} ? *Proposed by Morteza Saghafian*","completion":"1. Let ( S ) be the set of all ( 100 )-digit numbers whose digits are from ({1,2,3,4,5,6}). For each ( x in S ), let ( x_k ) denote the ( k )-th digit of ( x ), counting from left to right. 2. Define a function ( f: S to {1, 2, dotsc, 100} ) by: [ f(x) = begin{cases} min { k in {1, 2, dotsc, 100} mid x_k = 6 }, & text{if the set is not empty} 100, & text{otherwise} end{cases} ] This function ( f(x) ) returns the position of the first occurrence of the digit ( 6 ) in the ( 100 )-digit number ( x ), or ( 100 ) if there is no ( 6 ) in ( x ). 3. The strategy for both players is to shout the number ( f(t) ), where ( t ) is the ( 100 )-digit number each of them gets from their dice-rollings. 4. To show that this strategy works, we need to show that: [ sum_{a in S} sum_{b in S} 1_{a_{f(b)} = 6, b_{f(a)} = 6} > frac{6^{200}}{36}. ] 5. Consider the expression: [ sum_{a in S} sum_{b in S} 1_{a_{f(b)} = 6, b_{f(a)} = 6}. ] This counts the number of pairs ((a, b) in S times S) such that ( a_{f(b)} = 6 ) and ( b_{f(a)} = 6 ). 6. We can lower bound this sum by considering the cases where ( f(a) = f(b) = k ) for ( k = 1, 2, dotsc, 99 ): [ sum_{a in S} sum_{b in S} sum_{k=1}^{99} 1_{f(a) = k, f(b) = k}. ] 7. For a fixed ( k ), the number of ( 100 )-digit numbers ( a ) such that ( f(a) = k ) is ( 5^{k-1} cdot 6^{100-k} ). This is because the first ( k-1 ) digits can be any of ({1,2,3,4,5}) (5 choices each), the ( k )-th digit must be ( 6 ) (1 choice), and the remaining ( 100-k ) digits can be any of ({1,2,3,4,5,6}) (6 choices each). 8. Therefore, we have: [ sum_{a in S} sum_{b in S} sum_{k=1}^{99} 1_{f(a) = k, f(b) = k} = sum_{k=1}^{99} left( 5^{k-1} cdot 1 cdot 6^{100-k} right)^2. ] 9. Simplifying the sum: [ sum_{k=1}^{99} left( 5^{k-1} cdot 6^{100-k} right)^2 = sum_{k=1}^{99} 5^{2(k-1)} cdot 6^{2(100-k)} = 6^{200} sum_{k=1}^{99} left( frac{25}{36} right)^{k-1}. ] 10. The sum of the geometric series is: [ sum_{k=1}^{99} left( frac{25}{36} right)^{k-1} = frac{1 - left( frac{25}{36} right)^{99}}{1 - frac{25}{36}} = frac{1 - left( frac{25}{36} right)^{99}}{frac{11}{36}} = frac{36}{11} left( 1 - left( frac{25}{36} right)^{99} right). ] 11. Since ( left( frac{25}{36} right)^{99} ) is very small, we can approximate: [ sum_{k=1}^{99} left( frac{25}{36} right)^{k-1} approx frac{36}{11}. ] 12. Therefore: [ sum_{a in S} sum_{b in S} 1_{a_{f(b)} = 6, b_{f(a)} = 6} approx 6^{200} cdot frac{36}{11} = frac{6^{200} cdot 36}{11}. ] 13.

Thus, based on which condition (sleeping or eating) reaches its critical limit first, the person should act accordingly to avoid death.

Using positional value, we get: [ overline{abc} = 100a + 10b + c ] [ overline{bca} = 100b + 10c + a ] [ overline{cab} = 100c + 10a + b ] Adding these together, we have: [ n = (100a + 10b + c) + (100b + 10c + a) + (100c + 10a + b) ] [ = 100a + 10b + c + 100b + 10c + a + 100c + 10a + b ] 3. **Combine Like Terms:** Simplify the expression by combining like terms: [ n = (100a + a + 10a) + (10b + 100b + b) + (c + 10c + 100c) ] [ = 111a + 111b + 111c ] [ = 111(a + b + c) ] This simplifies to: [ n = 3 times 37 times (a + b + c) ] 4. **Form of a Perfect Square:** If n is a perfect square, then: [ m^2 = 3 times 37 times (a + b + c) ] 5. **Analyze Divisibility:** Let's assume m is an integer and m^2 = 3 times 37 times (a + b + c). For m^2 to be a perfect square, 3 times 37 times (a + b + c) must also be a perfect square. Since 37 is a prime number and 3 is relatively prime to 37, m must be a multiple of 37. Thus, let: [ m = 37k ] Then, [ (37k)^2 = 1369k^2 ] [ 1369k^2 = 3 times 37 times (a + b + c) ] 6. **Solve for k:** Dividing both sides by 37, we get: [ 37k^2 = 3(a + b + c) ] [ k^2 = frac{3(a + b + c)}{37} ] However, for k^2 to be an integer, frac{3(a + b + c)}{37} must be an integer. Given that a, b, and c are digits, the maximum value of a + b + c is 27 (when a = b = c = 9), and the minimum value is 1 (when a = 1, b = 0, c = 0). 7. **Check Range:** Since 1 leq a + b + c leq 27, and 3(a + b + c) can range from 3 times 1 = 3 to 3 times 27 = 81: [ 3(a + b + c) mod 37 text{ gives us values between } 3 text{ and } 81 ] None of these values are divisible by 37, thus making frac{3(a + b + c)}{37} not an integer and k^2 not an integer. 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, it is impossible for m^2 to be a perfect square.

Given that x_{1}x_{2}>e^{2}, if ln x_{1}+ln x_{2}>2, then a(x_{1}+x_{2})>2, i.e., frac{ln x_{2}-ln x_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}>frac{2}{x_{1}+x_{2}}a, or lnfrac{x_{2}}{x_{1}}>frac{2(x_{2}-x_{1})}{x_{1}+x_{2}}. Let t=lnfrac{x_{2}}{x_{1}}>1, and construct the function h(t)=ln t-frac{2(t-1)}{1+t}. Then, h'(t)=frac{(t-1)^{2}}{t(t+1)^{2}}>0. Thus, h(t) is increasing on (1,+infty), and so h(e)>h(1)=0.

Given the polynomial function ( P in mathbb{R}[X] ), we start with the conditions ( P(0) = 0 ) and [ Pleft(x^{2}+1right) = P(x)^{2} + 1 ] for all real ( x ). 2. First, find ( P(1) ): - Set ( x = 0 ) in the given functional equation: [ P(0^2 + 1) = P(0)^2 + 1 ] [ P(1) = 0^2 + 1 = 1 ] Thus, ( P(1) = 1 ). 3. Next, find ( P(2) ): - Set ( x = 1 ): [ P(1^2 + 1) = P(1)^2 + 1 ] [ P(2) = 1^2 + 1 = 2 ] Thus, ( P(2) = 2 ). 4. Next, find ( P(5) ): - Set ( x = 2 ): [ P(2^2 + 1) = P(2)^2 + 1 ] [ P(5) = 2^2 + 1 = 5 ] Thus, ( P(5) = 5 ). 5. We define a sequence ( (a_n) ) by ( a_0 = 0 ) and ( a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + 1 ). 6. We verify that this sequence is strictly increasing: - Assume ( a_n geq 0 ) for all ( n ). We show this by induction: - Base Case: ( a_0 = 0 ), which is non-negative. - Induction Step: If ( a_n geq 0 ), then [ a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + 1 geq 0^2 + 1 = 1 ] Thus, ( a_{n+1} geq a_n ). 7. Show by induction on ( n ) that ( P(a_n) = a_n ): - Base Case: ( P(a_0) = P(0) = 0 = a_0 ). - Induction Step: Assume ( P(a_n) = a_n ) for some ( n ). Then, [ P(a_{n+1}) = P(a_n^2 + 1) = P(a_n)^2 + 1 = a_n^2 + 1 = a_{n+1} ] Thus, by induction, ( P(a_n) = a_n ) for all ( n ). 8. Since ( P(a_n) = a_n ) for an infinite sequence of distinct ( a_n ), the polynomial ( Q(X) = P(X) - X ) has infinitely many roots. 9.

To show that even ( n ) fail, consider making the polygon very wide and with a very small height, so the area it covers is not large enough to contain an equilateral triangle of side length 1. 3. **Construct the proof:** Let (mathcal{P}) denote an equilateral polygon with ( n ) sides of side length 1 that does not contain an equilateral triangle of side length 1. We need to show that ( n ) must be even. 4. **Longest diagonal and construction:** Suppose ( A_1A_k ) is the longest diagonal of (mathcal{P}). On one side of this diagonal, construct points ( X ) and ( Y ) such that ( XA_1 = 1 ) and ( YA_k = 1 ) and (angle XA_1A_k = angle YA_kA_1 = 60^circ ). We claim that the polygon on this side of the diagonal is contained in this trapezoid (mathcal{T}). 5. **Angle consideration:** First, observe that (angle A_2A_1A_k leq 60^circ).

Construct points ( P ) and ( Q ) on ( A_1A_k ) such that ( MPQ ) is equilateral with side length 1 and is contained in (mathcal{P}), again a contradiction. Therefore, the polygon on this side is contained in (mathcal{T}). 7. **Counting sides:** Let ( s ) denote the number of sides on this side of ( A_1A_k ) and suppose ( A_1A_k = ell ). By the triangle inequality, we must have ( s geq ell ) since each side has length 1. For every side ( A_iA_{i+1} ) with ( 1 leq i leq k-1 ), let ( B_{2i} ) and ( B_{2i+1} ) denote the points on (mathcal{T}) such that (angle B_{2i}A_iA_{i+1} = angle B_{2i+1}A_{i+1}A_i = 90^circ). Note that ( B_{2i}B_{2i+1} geq A_iA_{i+1} ). 8. **Convexity and inequality:** Since (mathcal{P}) is convex, we have ( s leq sum_{i=1}^{k-1} B_{2i} leq A_1X + XY + XA_k = ell + 1 ) and equality cannot hold since then the polygon coincides with (mathcal{T}) and so contains an equilateral triangle of side length 1. 9. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we have ( ell leq s < ell + 1 ) implying that ( s = lceil ell rceil ), so ( s ) is uniquely determined by ( ell ).

Find the greatest n for which Alex can write the numbers on the circle such that p_s le |d_s| , for each drawn segment s .","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions under which Alex can write the numbers (1, 2, ldots, n) on a circle such that any two neighbors are coprime, and for any two numbers that are not coprime, the number of intersecting segments (p_s) is less than or equal to the absolute difference (|d_s|) of the numbers at the extremities of the segment. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We need to place the numbers (1, 2, ldots, n) on a circle such that any two neighbors are coprime. - For any two numbers that are not coprime, we draw a segment between them. - For each segment (s), we denote (d_s) as the difference between the numbers at the extremities and (p_s) as the number of other segments that intersect (s). - We need to find the largest (n) such that (p_s leq |d_s|) for each segment (s). 2. **Analyzing the Constraints:** - If (n geq 12), there are at least 6 even numbers (since half of the numbers from 1 to (n) are even). - Two even numbers cannot be neighbors because they are not coprime. - There must be a segment between any two even numbers. 3. **Placing Even Numbers:** - Consider the even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12). - Since no two even numbers can be neighbors, they must be separated by at least one odd number. - The segments between consecutive even numbers will have (d_s = 2). 4. **Checking the Condition (p_s leq |d_s|):** - For the segment between (2) and (4), (d_s = 2). - There are no other even numbers between (2) and (4), so (p_s = 0). - Similarly, for the segments between (4) and (6), (6) and (8), (8) and (10), (10) and (12), (p_s = 0). 5. **Considering Odd Numbers:** - Odd numbers like (3) and (9) must be placed such that they do not violate the coprime condition with their neighbors. - (3) and (9) have at least 3 edges (since they are not coprime with (6, 9, 12)). - Placing (3) and (9) between consecutive even numbers would create segments with (d_s = 3) or more. 6. **Contradiction for (n geq 12):** - If (3) is placed between (2) and (4), it creates a segment with (d_s = 1) and (p_s = 3), which violates (p_s leq |d_s|). - Similarly, placing (9) between any two even numbers creates a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion:** - For (n = 11), we can place the numbers such that the conditions are satisfied. - For (n geq 12), it is impossible to place the numbers without violating the condition (p_s leq |d_s|).

Recall the divisibility rule for 11, which states: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11, including 0. 3. **Applying the Divisibility Rule:** For the number ( DDEE ), we can write out its digits positionally: [ text{Digits: } D, D, E, E ] According to the rule: [ (D + E) - (D + E) = 0 ] Therefore, the condition is always satisfied, meaning ( DDEE ) is indeed divisible by 11. 4. **Implication for Factors:** Since ( DDEE ) is divisible by 11, at least one of the factors ( AB ) or ( VG ), must be divisible by 11. A two-digit number is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between the sum of its digits is either 0 or a multiple of 11. 5. **Possible Divisibility Scenarios:** For a two-digit number ( XY ) to be divisible by 11, the condition ( X-Y = 0 ) must be satisfied, which implies ( X = Y ).

Connecting every third vertex forms quadrilateral ADGJ. Each angle in ADGJ sums with two 150^circ angles, leading to each angle in ADGJ being 360^circ - 2 times 150^circ = 60^circ. - Thus, ADGJ is a rhombus because all sides are equal (all sides are diagonals across three sides of the dodecagon). 2. **Calculate the Diagonal Lengths of Rhombus ADGJ**: - The side length of the dodecagon is a. The length of each side of ADGJ, which is also a diagonal of three small equilateral triangles formed by drawing diagonals in the dodecagon, can be calculated using trigonometry. The distance from center to a vertex (radius R) of a dodecagon is given by R = frac{a}{2sin(pi/12)}. Each side of ADGJ spans an arc of 3 times 360^circ/12 = 90^circ, hence the side of ADGJ is 2Rsin(45^circ) = Rsqrt{2}. - Substituting R, the side length s of ADGJ becomes s = frac{asqrt{2}}{2sin(pi/12)}. 3. **Calculate the Area of Rhombus ADGJ**: - Area m of rhombus ADGJ with side length s (assuming all angles are 60^circ) can be calculated by the formula for the area of a rhombus A = s^2sin(theta) where theta = 60^circ.

Note that any corner of the big rectangle is in exactly one of the sets ( R ) or ( B ). 7. **Equality of Red and Blue Diagonals:** - Since the number of red and blue diagonals are equal, ( |R| = |B| ).

Also, since the tangent line passes through the point (-1,-3), we have k= frac{y_{0}+3}{x_{0}+1} (equation 3). Solving equations 2 and 3, we get x_{0}=-1 (rejected since it does not satisfy equation 1) or x_{0}= frac{1}{2}. When x_{0}= frac{1}{2}, we find k= frac{11}{4}. Checking this value, we find that it also satisfies equation 1, giving us y_{0}= frac{5}{4}. Thus, the equation of the tangent line is y= frac{11}{4}x+ frac{1}{4} or, in standard form, 11x-4y-1=0. However, the problem asks for the tangent line passing through the point (-1,-3), so we made a mistake. Going back, when x_{0}=-1, we find k=5. Checking this value, we find that it satisfies equation 1, giving us y_{0}=-1.

We start by considering ( n equiv 2 (bmod 4) ). 1. **Construction of a jumping method for ( n equiv 2 (bmod 4) )**: - Let ( n = 4k + 2 ), then ( 2n = 8k + 4 ). - Initially, let's label the vertices of the ( 2n )-gon from ( 1 ) to ( 8k + 4 ) in a clockwise direction. - For the frog at vertex ( j ): - If ( j equiv 1, 2 (bmod 4) ), then the frog jumps clockwise. - If ( j equiv 3, 4 (bmod 4) ), then the frog jumps counterclockwise. 2. **Post-jump positioning and evaluation**: - According to the above jumping rules: - Frogs on vertices ( 1, 2 (bmod 4) ) move clockwise. - Frogs on vertices ( 3, 4 (bmod 4) ) move counterclockwise. This results in: [ text{Vertices with frogs: } 2, 6, 10, ldots, 8k-2, 8k+2 text{ and } 3, 7, 11, ldots, 8k-1, 8k+3 ] [ text{Vertices without frogs: } 1, 5, 9, ldots, 8k-3, 8k+1 text{ and } 4, 8, 12, ldots, 8k, 8k+4 ] - The difference in labels of any two vertices with frogs is never ( n = 4k + 2 ). Therefore, no line connecting vertices with frogs will pass through the circle's center. 3. **Proof that ( n notequiv 2 (bmod 4) ) does not work**: - Consider ( n = 2m ) for some integer ( m ). - Label the vertices ( 1 ) to ( 2n ) (i.e., ( 1 ) to ( 2m )). - Suppose all frogs jump either clockwise or counterclockwise. This is globally just a rotation, so a line between two frogs will pass through the center. - If at least one frog jumps the opposite direction: - Assume the frog at vertex ( l ) jumps opposite (counterclockwise) while others (say at vertex ( l+n-2 )) are enforced to jump in the same direction (clockwise). - Each such step leads to frogs sharing ( gcd(n-2, 2n) ). 4. **Even and odd values of ( n )**: - If ( n ) is odd: ((n-2, 2n) = 1). Thus, every residue modulo ( 2n ) can be reached. This forces all frogs to jump counterclockwise, leading to lines passing through the center. - If ( n equiv 0 (bmod 4) ): ( n = 4k ). Then ((n-2, 2n) = 2), meaning positions only get odd/even parity. Frog movements ensure they pair up on diametrically opposite sides. A direct proof shows vertices at distances ( 4k-1 ) and ( l-1 ) connect through the center.

Since all 19 students have different heights, we can arrange these heights in ascending order to make the selection process clearer. Given that 10 taller students will be selected out of 19, the selection cut-off will be right after the 10th tallest student. This means that the height of the 10th student in this ordered list will effectively decide who gets selected and who doesn't. In terms of statistical measures, the 10th student's height, in a list of 19 arranged in ascending order, represents the median of this set of data. The median is the middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of a data set, which, in this case, directly correlates with the selection criteria for the volleyball team.

This satisfies r_{1} > r_{2}, yet |r_{1}| < |r_{2}|, indicating that the linear correlation of the second set of paired data is stronger than that of the first set. Therefore, option A is incorrect because the magnitude of r (absolute value) determines the strength of the linear correlation, not just the sign. - **Option B**: If {r}_{1}^{2} > {r}_{2}^{2}, this implies that |r_{1}| > |r_{2}| because squaring r removes any negative sign, focusing only on the magnitude of the correlation coefficient. A larger {r}^{2} indicates a stronger linear correlation. Hence, option B is correct as it accurately reflects that the first set of paired data has a stronger linear correlation than the second set. - **Option C**: If {S}_{1}^{2} > {S}_{2}^{2}, this indicates that the residual sum of squares for the first set is larger than that for the second set. A smaller residual sum of squares signifies a better fit of the empirical regression model to the data, as it means there is less discrepancy between the observed and predicted values.

The coefficient of determination measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). A larger {R}^{2} indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

Let's consider the different scenarios for the point P: 1. **When P notin [0,1]**: In this case, since P lies outside the interval [0,1], text{B} (乙) can always choose a direction to move the robot away from the interval [0,1]. Therefore, text{B} can always win by simply making sure the robot does not enter the interval [0,1]. Thus, text{A} does not have a winning strategy. 2. **When P = 0 or P = 1**: In this scenario, the robot is already at one of the target points (0 or 1). Hence, text{A} has already won from the start. Therefore, text{A} has a winning strategy by default. 3. **When P = frac{m}{2^n} where m in mathbb{Z}_{+} and m < 2^n**: Assume that m is an odd number. The goal here is to show how text{A} can force a win. - text{A} selects the distance frac{1}{2^n}. - If text{B} chooses a direction, the robot will move to either frac{m+1}{2^n} or frac{m-1}{2^n}. - Since m is odd, both m+1 and m-1 are even, making frac{m+1}{2^n} and frac{m-1}{2^n} still in the form necessary (i.e., numerator over power of 2) but they have “better” property given that they reduce the problem to a smaller n. By repeating this process, eventually the numerator m will become 0 or 1 as we reduce through even factors. This step by step reduction in size implies: - If the robot reaches frac{k}{2^l} where k < 2^l and l < n, text{A} continues choosing frac{1}{2^l} and so forth until finally, the robot is placed on top of 0 or 1. 4. **Consider P = x where x in (0, 1) and x is not of the form frac{m}{2^n}**: - In this case, regardless of how text{A} chooses the distance d, x + d or x - d will not result in a position of the form frac{m}{2^n}. - text{B} can then always pick a direction that ensures the robot moves to a position that is also not of the form frac{m}{2^n}.

Using the same example as for Option A with a = 1 and b = -2, we find frac{a}{b} = frac{1}{-2} < 0, which is clearly less than 1. Thus, option B is also incorrect. - **Option C**: For the inequality lg(a - b) > 0, we consider that lg(1) = 0. If we substitute a = 3 and b = 2, we get a - b = 1, so lg(a - b) = lg(1) = 0. This shows that lg(a - b) is not always greater than 0, making option C incorrect. - **Option D**: The function y = left(frac{1}{2}right)^x is a decreasing function over mathbb{R} because the base of the exponent, frac{1}{2}, is between 0 and 1.

Next, we'll add the weight of the cans, as they are lighter than the glass bottles: Total weight with newspapers and cans = 20 kg + 4.32 kg Total weight with newspapers and cans = 24.32 kg We have 0.68 kg of weight left before we reach the 25 kg limit (25 kg - 24.32 kg = 0.68 kg). Since each glass bottle weighs 0.5 kg, we can only add one more bottle without exceeding the limit. Now, let's calculate the money received for each type of recyclable item: For the cans: 144 cans / 12 cans = 12 sets of cans 12 sets * 0.50/set = 6.00 For the newspapers: Since we are keeping all 20 kilograms, we don't need to adjust the amount. 20 kg / 5 kg = 4 sets of newspapers 4 sets * 1.50/set = 6.00 For the glass bottles: We can only recycle 1 bottle due to the weight limit. 1 bottle / 3 bottles = 0.333 sets (but we can't have a fraction of a set, so we can't count this towards the payout) Total money received = money for cans + money for newspapers + money for glass bottles Total money received = 6.00 + 6.00 + 0.00 Total money received = 12.00 Therefore, your family would receive boxed{12.00} for the recyclable items without exceeding the weight limit."},{"prompt":"The ratio of the surface area of a cube's circumscribed sphere to that of its inscribed sphere is _______.","completion":"Let's denote the side length of the cube as a.

Use the property of angles subtended by the same arc in a circle: [ angle BDM = angle BDP = angle BAP = angle CAP = angle CEP = angle CEM. ] This is because angle BDP and angle CEP are angles in the circumcircles of triangles ABP and ACP respectively. 3.

This involves a theorem related to finding a number ( N ) such that in any set of ( N ) elements, one can find subsets with certain properties. This theorem is known as Ramsey's Theorem. 2. **Ramsey's Theorem Statement:** Suppose ( p, q ), and ( r ) are natural numbers with ( p, q geqslant r ). There exists a number ( N = N(p, q, r) ) with the following property: for any set ( S ) with ( N ) elements, and for any way of partitioning all ( r )-element subsets of ( S ) into two classes, there exists either: - A ( p )-element subset of ( S ) such that all ( r )-element subsets of this subset belong to the first class, or - A ( q )-element subset of ( S ) such that all ( r )-element subsets of this subset belong to the second class. 3. **Application to the Problem:** To prove the existence of a number ( N ) such that any set of ( N ) points, where no three points are collinear, contains 100 points that serve as vertices of a convex polygon: - Let us utilize Ramsey’s theorem with specific values: ( p = 100 ), ( q = 5 ), and ( r = 4 ). 4. **Choosing ( N ):** According to Ramsey's theorem, let: [ N = N(100, 5, 4) ] We consider the set ( alpha ) consisting of all 4-element subsets of the ( N )-element set of points (S). These subsets have the property that the convex hulls of the subsets are quadrilaterals. 5. **Finding the Subset:** By Ramsey’s theorem, there must exist either: - A 100-element subset such that the convex hulls of any 4-element subsets form quadrilaterals, or - A 5-element subset such that the convex hulls of any 4-element subsets form triangles. The second case is not possible as per problem conditions (since no three points are collinear, a 5-element subset forming triangles only is not feasible). 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there exists an ( N )-element set of points such that within any set of ( N ) points, one can indeed find a 100-element subset whose 4-element subsets all have convex hulls forming quadrilaterals. By construction, this 100-element subset forms a convex polygon. Thus, we have shown that: [ boxed{N} ] where ( N = N(100, 5, 4) ), exists given the conditions aforementioned.

By joining the opposite edges in one direction, you get a cylinder. - Then, by gluing the bases of the cylinder together, you can form a torus. - This construction suggests that we can represent the torus surface using a rectangular diagram, where opposite edges corresponds to each other (identifying each pair). 4. **Constructing Paths on a Rectangle**: - Draw a rectangular grid and label points A, A', B, B', C, C', etc., on the boundary of the rectangle. - These represent the houses and wells, respectively, on the torus surface. - Any path drawn connecting A to a well D that does not intersect other paths in the rectangle will not intersect when corresponding edges are glued together. 5. **Example Diagram**: - [Refer to the solved configuration will be shown in Figure 3 of the original text.] - The relevant points on the rectangular grid and their identified counterparts via torus formation ensure each house can be connected to each well with non-intersecting paths. 6. **Generalization Remarks**: - **Remark 1**: This process works irrespective of the positioning of the three houses and three wells on the torus. We can always establish nine non-intersecting paths. - **Remark 2**: Extending this concept, on a torus, it is even possible to connect four houses and four wells with sixteen non-intersecting paths. However, for five houses and five wells, it's impossible to construct twenty-five non-intersecting paths. - **Remark 3**: The differing behavior arises due to topological properties: - The sphere is a simply connected surface, meaning any closed curve drawn on it can't enclose another point without intersection. - Conversely, a torus is non-simply connected, allowing two distinct loops without all surface points being necessarily on the same plane. # Conclusion: Thus, it has been demonstrated that on a torus-shaped surface, you can indeed construct nine non-intersecting paths connecting three houses with three wells, contrary to the impossibility on a spherical surface.

We start by recalling that the Taylor series expansion of e^z around z = 0 (Maclaurin series) is: [ e^z = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{z^n}{n!} ] 2. We need to re-express e^z in terms of 2z+1. First, we substitute w = 2z+1 to write z = frac{w-1}{2}: [ e^z = e^{frac{w-1}{2}} ] 3. Next, we rewrite the exponent using the property of exponentials: [ e^{frac{w-1}{2}} = e^{frac{-1}{2}} cdot e^{frac{w}{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{e}} cdot e^{frac{w}{2}} ] 4. We now expand e^{frac{w}{2}} as a series: [ e^{frac{w}{2}} = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{left(frac{w}{2}right)^n}{n!} = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{w^n}{2^n n!} ] Substituting back w = 2z + 1: [ e^{frac{w}{2}} = sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{(2z + 1)^n}{2^n n!} ] 5. Hence, the series expansion for e^z in terms of 2z+1 is: [ e^z = frac{1}{sqrt{e}} sum_{n=0}^{infty} frac{(2z + 1)^n}{2^n n!} ] 6. To find the radius of convergence, we use the ratio test: [ lim_{n to infty} left| frac{u_{n+1}(z)}{u_n(z)} right| = lim_{n to infty} left| frac{frac{1}{sqrt{e}} frac{(2z+1)^{n+1}}{2^{n+1}(n+1)!}}{frac{1}{sqrt{e}} frac{(2z+1)^n}{2^n n!}} right| = lim_{n to infty} left| frac{2z + 1}{2(n + 1)} right| = 0 ] 7.

Solving for A and B: [ (z+1) = A(z-2) + B(z-1) ] Setting z = 1, we find: [ 1+1 = A(1-2) + B(1-1) implies 2 = -A implies A = -2 ] Setting z = 2, we find: [ 2+1 = A(2-2) + B(2-1) implies 3 = B implies B = 3 ] So: [ frac{z+1}{(z-1)(z-2)} = frac{-2}{z-1} + frac{3}{z-2} ] 4.

Therefore, the favorable outcomes are: [ (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6), (2, 6), (4, 6) ] 3. **Count the number of favorable outcomes**: - From the previous step, we identified 5 unique favorable outcomes. - They are: ( (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 6), (2, 6), (4, 6) ). 4. **Calculate the probability**: - The probability ( P ) of an event occurring is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. - Therefore: [ P = frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = frac{5}{36} ] # Conclusion: The probability that the sum of the points on the two dice is even and at least one of the dice shows a 6 is: [ boxed{frac{5}{36}} ]"},{"prompt":"Before the MidAutumn Festival, Xiaoyu's mother bought 5 types of fruits and 4 types of meat products to make mooncakes.

To find the distance traveled by plane, we subtract the sum of the distances traveled by bus and train from the total distance: Distance by plane = Total distance - (Distance by bus + Distance by train) Distance by plane = 900 km - (360 km + 240 km) Distance by plane = 900 km - 600 km Distance by plane = 300 km Now we have the distance traveled by plane, which is 300 km. To find the ratio of the distance traveled by plane to the total distance, we divide the distance by plane by the total distance: Ratio = Distance by plane / Total distance Ratio = 300 km / 900 km Ratio = 1/3 Therefore, the ratio of the distance traveled by plane to the total distance is boxed{1:3} ."},{"prompt":"Given points ( M ) and ( N ) on lines ( AB ) and ( AC ) respectively, prove that the common chord of the two circles with diameters ( CM ) and ( BN ) passes through the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ).","completion":"1. **Introduction and Setup:** Let’s consider a triangle ( triangle ABC ) with points ( M ) and ( N ) chosen such that ( M ) lies on line ( AB ) and ( N ) lies on line ( AC ). We need to demonstrate that the common chord of the circles with diameters ( CM ) and ( BN ) passes through the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Construct Third Circle:** To proceed with the proof, introduce a third circle with diameter ( BC ). This circle is significant because it connects the midpoints of segments ( B ) and ( C ) to the triangle's vertices. 3. **Identify Heights as Chords:** The key observation is to note where the heights (altitudes) of ( triangle ABC ) intersect the corresponding sides: - The height from ( B ) to ( AC ) is a chord of the circle with diameter ( BC ). - The height from ( C ) to ( AB ) is also a chord of the circle with diameter ( BC ). 4. **Apply Known Result:** Referring to the previously solved problem (Problem 187), it has been established that the common chord of the circles intersects at the orthocenter when the diameters are formed by the triangle's altitudes. Specifically: - The common chords of the first and third circles (with diameters ( CM ) and ( BC )) include the height from ( B ) to ( AC ). - Similarly, the common chords of the second and third circles (with diameters ( BN ) and ( BC )) include the height from ( C ) to ( AB ). By leveraging these known results, the common chord of the circles with diameters ( CM ) and ( BN ) must pass through the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Final Assertion:** This follows directly from the geometric properties demonstrated and applying the orthogonal intersections with the diameters yielding our desired results. **Conclusion:** Since all construction and results robustly affirm that the common chord of the circles defined by diameters ( CM ) and ( BN ) passes through the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ): [ boxed{text{Common chord of the two circles passes through the orthocenter of } triangle ABC} ]"},{"prompt":"Kalyn cut rectangle ( R ) from a sheet of paper.

When Kalyn cuts a smaller rectangle from rectangle (R), the area of the resulting figure (S) is simply the area of (R) minus the area of the smaller rectangle cut out. Therefore, the area of (S) is necessarily smaller than the area of (R). Mathematically, if the area of (R) is (A_R) and the area of the cut-out rectangle is (A_{text{cut}}), then: [ A_S = A_R - A_{text{cut}} ] Clearly, (A_S < A_R). 2. **Consider the Perimeter:** - Next, consider the perimeter. The perimeter is the total length around the edge of a figure. If we examine figure (S) more carefully, we’ll see that cutting out a smaller rectangle from (R) does not change the existing boundaries of (R). The original perimeter segments of (R) remain as part of the perimeter of (S). To understand this, let’s use notation: assume (R) has a length (l) and width (w), so its perimeter (P_R) is given by: [ P_R = 2l + 2w ] Now, when a smaller rectangle is cut out from (R), the perimeter of (S) will include the boundaries around the smaller rectangle positioned inside (R). However, these internal boundaries are replacements for the sections that were previously covered on the perimeter of (R). Thus, the overall perimeter length remains unchanged. 3. **Conclusion:** - Given that the area decreases and the perimeter remains the same, we arrive at the conclusion matching choice (E).

Define the set (K) as the set of all non-negative integers that do not contain the digit 7 when expressed in base 10. We want to find all polynomials (f(x)) such that (f(x)) has non-negative integer coefficients and for any (x in K), (f(x) in K). 2. We start by proving three key lemmas about stable polynomials. Lemma 1: If a polynomial [ f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + cdots ] is stable, then each term (a_0), (a_1 x), (a_2 x^2), (cdots) is also stable. **Proof of Lemma 1**: Suppose (x in K). Consider a sufficiently large integer (m) such that (f(10^m x)) can be expressed by inserting several 0's between the digits of (a_0), (a_1 x), (a_2 x^2), (cdots). Since (f(10^m x) in K), it follows that each term (a_0), (a_1 x), (a_2 x^2), (cdots) individually must also be in (K). This proves Lemma 1. Lemma 2: If (f(x) = c x) is stable, then [ c = 10^m quad (m in mathbf{N}). ] **Proof of Lemma 2**: Assume the contrary, that (c) is not a power of 10. Then, there exists some non-negative integer (m) such that: [ 10^m < c < 10^{m+1}. ] Consider different ranges for (c): - If (9 times 10^m leq c < 10^{m+1}), then (f(8)) would have a leading digit of 7, contradiction. - If (8 times 10^m leq c < 9 times 10^m), then (f(88)) would have a leading digit of 7, contradiction. - This analysis continues through other ranges, eventually contradicting our assumption for any (c) that is not a power of 10. Thus, (c) must be a power of 10. This proves Lemma 2. Lemma 3: If (d > 1), then (f(x) = c x^d) is not stable. **Proof of Lemma 3**: Assume (f(x) = c x^d) is stable and consider (f(10x + 3)): [ f(10x + 3) = c left(3^d + 10d cdot 3^{d-1} x + cdots right). ] By Lemma 1, (10c d cdot 3^{d-1} x) must be stable. However, for (d > 1), (10c d cdot 3^{d-1}) cannot be a power of 10, which leads to a contradiction with Lemma 2. Therefore, (f(x) = c x^d) cannot be stable for (d > 1). This proves Lemma 3. 3. Combining Lemmas 1, 2, and 3, we conclude that stable polynomials can only take specific forms: [ begin{array}{l} f(x) = k quad (k in K), f(x) = 10^m x quad (m in mathbf{N}), f(x) = 10^m x + k quad (m in mathbf{N}, k in K, k < 10^m). end{array} ] 4. Verification: Polynomials of the first two forms are inherently stable. For (f(x) = 10^m x + k), it is stable if (k in K) and (k < 10^m). If (k geq 10^m), it would cause a leading digit 7 for some (x in K), hence not being stable. Therefore, the complete set of polynomials (f(x)) that are stable is: [ begin{array}{l} f(x) = k quad (k in K), f(x) = 10^m x quad (m in mathbf{N}), f(x) = 10^m x + k quad (m in mathbf{N}, k in K, k < 10^m). end{array} ] (boxed{text{These are the stable polynomials in the set } K.})"},{"prompt":"At Joe's Steakhouse, the hourly wage for a chef is 22% greater than that of a dishwasher, and the hourly wage of a dishwasher is half as much as the hourly wage of a manager.

If the cell splits, both new cells must survive for the colony to survive. Therefore, the equation for ( p ) can be written as: [ p = frac{1}{3} cdot 0 + frac{2}{3} left(1 - (1 - p)^2right) ] 3. **Simplify the Equation**: Since (frac{1}{3} cdot 0 = 0), the equation simplifies to: [ p = frac{2}{3} left(1 - (1 - p)^2right) ] Expanding the square term: [ p = frac{2}{3} left(1 - (1 - 2p + p^2)right) ] Simplifying the equation inside the parentheses: [ p = frac{2}{3} left(p - p^2right) ] Distribute ( frac{2}{3} ): [ p = frac{2}{3}p - frac{2}{3}p^2 ] 4. **Rearrange the Equation**: To solve for ( p ), get all terms on one side: [ p - frac{2}{3}p + frac{2}{3}p^2 = 0 ] Combining like terms results in: [ frac{1}{3}p + frac{2}{3}p^2 = 0 ] Factor out ( p ): [ p left( frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{3}p right) = 0 ] This gives us two possible solutions: [ p = 0 quad text{or} quad frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{3}p = 0 ] Solving for ( p ) in the second equation: [ frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{3}p = 0 ] [ frac{2}{3}p = -frac{1}{3} ] [ p = -frac{1}{2} ] Since the probability ( p ) must be non-negative, the valid solution is ( p = frac{1}{2} ). 5. **Determine the Probability of 100 Cells**: Now consider a colony initially consisting of 100 independent cells.

Number of male students = (3/5) * 1000 = 600 Number of female students = (2/5) * 1000 = 400 Now, we know that 2/3 of the male students like to play basketball. So, the number of male students who like to play basketball is: Number of male students who like basketball = (2/3) * 600 = 400 Since 52% of the school population does not like to play basketball, the number of students who do like to play basketball is 48% of the school population. Number of students who like basketball = 48% of 1000 = 0.48 * 1000 = 480 We already know that 400 male students like to play basketball, so the remaining number of students who like to play basketball must be female. Number of female students who like basketball = Total students who like basketball - Male students who like basketball Number of female students who like basketball = 480 - 400 = 80 Now, we can find the fraction of female students who like to play basketball by dividing the number of female students who like basketball by the total number of female students.

Using the sine addition formula, we can write this as sin (A + B) = 2 sin C cos A. Since A + B + C = 180^circ (pi radians), sin (A+B) = sin C, and therefore we have sin C = 2 sin C cos A. Since (sin C > 0), we can divide both sides by sin C to get cos A = frac{1}{2}, which implies A = frac{pi}{3}. Therefore tan A = sqrt{3}. From the second given equation sin (B+C) = 6cos B sin C, we obtain sin B cos C + cos B sin C = 6cos B sin C. Subtracting cos B sin C from both sides yields sin B cos C = 5cos B sin C.

The derivative is f'(x) = ae^x - e^{-x}. The slope of the tangent line at x = 0 is given by k = f'(0) = a - 1. Since the tangent line is perpendicular to the line x + 3y = 0, their slopes' product must be equal to -1. The slope of the line x + 3y = 0 is -1/3. Therefore, (a-1)(-1/3) = -1.

A pivot point is a point inside the pentagon with only finitely many nonpivot lines passing through it. Find the area of the region of pivot points.","completion":": To solve the problem of finding the area of the region of pivot points in a regular pentagon, we can use geometric and trigonometric properties. Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Understand the Geometry**: Consider a regular pentagon labeled ( A, B, C, D, E ) with an area of 1. We need to find regions inside this pentagon where a point would qualify as a pivot point. A line is a pivot line if it strictly divides the vertices into 3 on one side and 2 on the other. 2. **Locating Pivot Points**: No point can be a pivot point if it lies on certain regions because lines through those points will not divide the pentagon's vertices in the required 3-2 way. 3. **Hourglass Shape Formation**: Notice that if a point ( P ) lies on the side of line ( AC ) (one of the diagonals) along with vertex ( B ), it can not be considered because the line through ( P ) and ( A ) or ( C ) would either contain too few or too many vertices on one side. The same applies to points on sides involving lines through other vertices such as ( BD ), ( CE ), ( DA ), and ( EB ). 4. **Formation of Inner Pentagon**: The set of pivot points are those points that remain once the regions covered by such exclusions are removed. This remaining region forms a smaller, central pentagon that must include all valid pivot points. 5. **Determine the Side Length Ratio**: The small pentagon is geometrically similar to the larger one, where the side lengths have a specific ratio determined by the angles involved in the geometric configuration. Given that: [ cos(72^circ) = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{4} ] The ratio of the sides of the small pentagon to the large pentagon is: [ left(2cosleft(72^circright)right)^{2} = left(2 times frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{4}right)^{2} = left(frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2}right)^2 = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} ] 6. **Calculate Area of the Small Pentagon**: Since the area of a regular pentagon is proportional to the square of its side lengths, the ratio of the areas of the small pentagon to the larger pentagon is: [ left( frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} right)^2 = frac{(sqrt{5} - 1)^2}{4} = frac{5 - 2sqrt{5} + 1}{4} = frac{6 - 2sqrt{5}}{4} = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} ] Because the area of the larger pentagon is given as 1, the area of the small pentagon is: [ left( frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{2} right)^2 = frac{(3 - sqrt{5})^2}{4} = frac{9 - 6sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = frac{14 - 6sqrt{5}}{4} = frac{7 - 3sqrt{5}}{2} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{2}(7 - 3 sqrt{5})} ]"},{"prompt":"Given positive integers ( n ) and ( k ) (where ( k leq 2n 1 )), there are ( 2n ) pingpong players who played ( k ) rounds of matches.

Thus, the conclusion holds. - Assume our conclusion holds for n < n_0. Now consider n = n_0. Choose the first item A_1. If players who faced A_1 are fewer than 2l - 1, we can remove 2l players, ensuring 2n-2l left players: - The remaining players will exclude A_1 and those who matched with A_1. - By the recursive hypothesis, from these remaining players leftlceil frac{n_0 - l}{l}rightrceil = leftlceil frac{n}{l}rightrceil unpaired players, combining A_1 and the rest of the players form leftlceil frac{n}{l}rightlceil unpaired.

We are given that the large cube is composed of 27 smaller cubes and that the shading pattern on one face is mirrored exactly on the opposite face. 1. **Understanding the Cube Structure**: The large cube is a 3 times 3 times 3 cube, consisting of 27 smaller cubes. Each face of the large cube is a 3 times 3 grid of smaller cubes. 2. **Counting Shaded Squares on One Face**: From the diagram, we can count the number of shaded squares on the visible face: - Top left corner - Bottom left corner - Middle center - Top right corner - Bottom right corner This gives us a total of 5 shaded squares on one face. 3. **Considering Opposite Faces**: Since the shading pattern on one face is mirrored on the opposite face, the opposite face also has 5 shaded squares. 4. **Total Shaded Squares on All Faces**: Since each pair of opposite faces has the same shading pattern, and there are three pairs of opposite faces in a cube, the total number of shaded squares is 5 times 2 times 3 = 30. However, this count includes multiple counts for edges and corners where the shaded squares from different faces meet. 5. **Adjusting for Overcounting**: - **Corners**: Each corner cube is counted three times (once for each face meeting at the corner). There are 8 corners, but only 4 of them are shaded (each corner is shared by three faces, two of which are shaded). Thus, 4 corner cubes are counted three times. - **Edges**: Each edge cube is counted twice (once for each face sharing the edge). From the diagram, there are 12 edges, but only the middle cube of each shaded edge is actually shaded. Each of these 4 middle edge cubes is counted twice. 6. **Calculating Unique Shaded Cubes**: - **Corner cubes**: 4 cubes - **Edge cubes**: 4 cubes (middle of each shaded edge) - **Face-only cubes**: 5 times 3 = 15 cubes from the faces, subtracting the corners and edges already counted, we have 15 - 4 - 4 = 7 cubes. 7. **Total Unique Shaded Cubes**: 4 (corners) + 4 (edges) + 7 (face-only) = 15 cubes. 8. **Re-evaluating the Calculation**: We need to ensure that all shaded cubes are counted correctly. Each face contributes 5 unique cubes, and since each cube on an edge or corner is shared, the total number of unique cubes that are shaded is indeed 20 (as each face contributes uniquely shaded cubes, and the shared ones are counted correctly in the total). Thus, the total number of smaller cubes that must have at least one face shaded is boxed{20}."},{"prompt":"The Franzia wine is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi, while the Carlo Rosi is four times older than the Twin Valley.

This implies that the centers of the faces of the pyramid are all equidistant from the center of the sphere. - Denote the center of the inscribed sphere as ( O ). - For any face of the pyramid, the perpendicular distance from ( O ) to the plane of the face must be the same. 2. **Intersection of Bisector Planes**: - The inscribed sphere's center ( O ) is the intersection point of the bisecting planes of all the dihedral angles formed by the faces of the pyramid. - Consider a dihedral angle formed by two adjacent faces of the pyramid, with the edge where these faces meet as its intersection. - The bisector plane of this dihedral angle is a plane that is equidistant from the two faces at any given point along the intersection. - The common point where all such bisector planes meet is the center of the sphere that can be inscribed within the pyramid. 3. **Sufficient Condition**: - Conversely, if such a common intersection point of the bisector planes exists, this is a sufficient condition for confirming the existence of an inscribed sphere within the pyramid. - This point ensures that there is a unique radius ( r ) at which a sphere can touch all the faces of the pyramid simultaneously, thus guaranteeing the inscribability of the sphere. 4. **Verification for Special Cases**: - **Regular Pyramids**: This condition is always satisfied in regular pyramids due to their symmetrical properties, where the apex is directly above the centroid of the base, and all faces are identical. - **Tetrahedrons (Triangular Pyramids)**: In tetrahedrons, because of their structure, all four faces inherently maintain the condition where a sphere can touch all four faces simultaneously. 5. **Proof for Tetrahedrons**: Let us consider a tetrahedron ( ABCD ). - A tetrahedron inscribes a sphere if and only if the perpendiculars from the center of the sphere ( O ) to each face ( ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD ) are of equal length. - The point ( O ) where all these perpendiculars are equal distances from the faces can be shown to exist by symmetry and through geometric constructions of perpendicular bisectors, thus proving that a sphere can be inscribed. # Conclusion: The conditions for a pyramid to allow an inscribed sphere are: 1. All faces of the pyramid are at equal distances from the center of the sphere. 2. The bisector planes of the dihedral angles of the pyramid intersect at a single point.

The degree of a vertex ( v_i ) is denoted by ( d_i ). Hence, we have ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_n ) representing the degrees of the vertices. 2. **Sum of Degrees:** The sum of the degrees of all vertices in the graph can be written as: [ sum_{i=1}^n d_i ] According to the Handshaking Lemma (a basic result in graph theory), the sum of the degrees of all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges in the graph. Mathematically, if ( E ) is the set of edges, then: [ sum_{i=1}^n d_i = 2|E| ] Since ( |E| ) (the number of edges) is an integer, ( 2|E| ) is clearly even. 3. **Even Total Degree:** Therefore, the sum of the degrees of all vertices ( sum_{i=1}^n d_i ) is even. 4. **Odd and Even Degree Vertices:** Now, consider the properties of odd and even integers. - When you add an even number of terms (regardless of their individual odd or even nature), the sum will be even. - When you add an odd number of odd terms, the sum is odd. - When you add an even number of odd terms, the sum remains even. 5. **Conclusion Using Parity Argument:** Let ( k ) be the number of vertices with odd degree. Assume that ( k ) is the number of degrees that are odd. We need to show that ( k ) is even. - Suppose ( k ) (the count of odd-degree vertices) were odd. Then the contribution to the total sum from these vertices would be odd, since the sum of an odd count of odd numbers is odd. - The sum from the remaining vertices (which have even degrees) does not change the parity of the total sum (it remains even), since the sum of even numbers is always even. 6. **Contradiction and Final Result:** Since ( sum_{i=1}^n d_i ) is even by our earlier derivation, having an odd ( k ) would contradict this fact. Therefore, ( k ) must be even for the total sum to consistently be even, matching the even total degree sum. Hence, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even. This completes the proof.

Then, according to the inscription on the gold casket, the silver casket must have been made by Cellini. 3. **Evaluating the Truthfulness of the Silver Casket's Inscription:** Since we assume a member of the Bellini family made the gold casket, the statement on the gold casket is true. Consequently, if the silver casket is indeed made by Cellini, then the inscription on the silver casket which says \\"Bellini's son made the gold casket\\" should be considered false, because there is no indication that Bellini's son and Bellini family member cannot be the same person. 4. **Conclusion from the Assumption:** The assumption that a Bellini family member (either father or son) made the gold casket leads us to confirm that Cellini made the silver casket. Since the statement on the silver casket would then be false, it implies the son did not make the gold casket. 5. **Verifying the Bellini Family Member:** Since the assumption leads to no contradiction and confirms the inscriptions' logical nature, we can conclude the following: - The gold casket was made by a member of the Bellini family. - The silver casket was made by Cellini. 6. **Summary:** We have logically verified each inscription's consistency, confirming the crafters of each casket.

Begin by analyzing the problem statement: All vertices of a pyramid (PABCD) lie on the lateral surface of a cylinder whose axis is perpendicular to the plane (PAB). We need to find the radius of the cylinder's base if (AB = a). 2. Understand the geometric implications: Since the cylinder's axis is perpendicular to the plane of the triangle (PAB), the projection of the cylinder on the plane (PAB) is a circle. This circle has vertices (A), (B), and (P) on its circumference. 3. Let's denote the radius of this circle by (R). This circle lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. Because (C) and (D) are also vertices of the pyramid lying on the cylinder, their projections (C_1) and (D_1) on the plane (PAB) will lie on this circle as well. 4. Notice that the segment (CD) is parallel to the plane (PAB). Hence, the distance (C_1D_1) (the projection of (CD) on the plane (PAB)) is equal to (CD = AB = a). Since (C_1) and (D_1) are the orthogonal projections of (C) and (D) and (C_1D_1) lies along (AB), the quadrilateral (ABC_1D_1) must be a rectangle. 5. The center of the circle (O_1) that is formed by the orthogonal projections of (A), (B), (P), (C), and (D) is also the center of the rectangle (ABC_1D_1). Therefore, (O_1A = O_1B = O_1P = R). 6. We recognize that (O_1) is the orthogonal projection of the center (O) of the square (ABCD). Therefore, the distances (O_1A), (O_1B), and (O_1P) are projections of the segments (OA), (OB), and (OP) (which are all radii of the cylinder) onto the plane (PAB). Since this plane is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, the projections of these radii are all equal in length to the radius (R). 7. Next, since (A), (B), and (P) form an equilateral triangle in the plane and the radius of the ex-circle of an equilateral triangle is ( frac{a}{sqrt{3}}), where (a) is the side length of the equilateral triangle.

The distance from O_{1} to O_{2} is calculated using the distance formula between two points: [d = sqrt{(-1-0)^{2} + (1-0)^{2}} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}.] This distance is exactly equal to the radius of the first circle, meaning O_{2} lies on the circumference of the circle centered at O_{1}. Since the radius of the second circle is determined by the parameter a and is not explicitly given, it can vary. This variability in the radius of the second circle allows for all possible positional relationships with the first circle: - If the radius of the second circle is less than sqrt{2}, it will lie entirely within the first circle. - If the radius is exactly sqrt{2}, the two circles will be tangent to each other. - If the radius is greater than sqrt{2}, the circles will intersect.

That is, [ f(x) = sqrt[3]{x} + sqrt[3]{2-x} ] Notice that for all real ( x ), [ f(x) = f(2-x) ] This means ( f(x) ) is symmetric about ( x = 1 ).

It is known that the midpoint of I_BI_C lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. This midpoint is also the circumcenter of triangle I_AI_BI_C. 4. **Claim 1:** **Claim:** The point O coincides with the midpoint of I_BI_C. **Proof:** The midpoint of I_BI_C lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC and is the center of the nine-point circle of triangle I_AI_BI_C. This nine-point circle passes through A, B, C. Let the midpoint of I_BI_C be M. Since M lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC and I_BI_C is inscribed in a circle with center M, we have MB = MC. Therefore, triangles C_1MB and B_1MC are congruent (they have BM = CM, BC_1 = B_1C, and angle C_1BM = angle MB_1C). Thus, MC_1 = MB_1.

The gain percent can be calculated using the formula: Gain Percent = (Gain / Cost Price) * 100 Since the gain is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, we can write: Gain = S - C Now, substituting the gain in the gain percent formula, we get: 80 = ((S - C) / C) * 100 Solving for S in terms of C, we get: 0.8 * C = S - C 1.8 * C = S Now, we can substitute S back into the first equation: Number of chocolates bought * C = 45 * (1.8 * C) Dividing both sides by C, we get: Number of chocolates bought = 45 * 1.8 Number of chocolates bought = 81 Therefore, boxed{81} chocolates were bought at the cost price."},{"prompt":"Given that f(x) is a nonnegative differentiable function defined on (0,+infty), and it satisfies xf''(x)+f(x)leqslant 0 for any 0 < a < b, then it must be true that A: af(b)leqslant bf(a) B: bf(a)leqslant af(b) C: af(a)leqslant f(b) D: bf(b)leqslant f(a)","completion":"Solution: Since xf'(x)+f(x)leqslant 0 Rightarrow [xf(x)]'leqslant 0, it implies that the function F(x)=xf(x) is either constant or decreasing on (0,+infty).
