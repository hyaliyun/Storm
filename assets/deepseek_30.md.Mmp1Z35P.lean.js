We can multiply equation 1 by 2 to align the x terms: 2x + 6y = 40 (Equation 6) Now we subtract equation 5 from equation 6 to eliminate x: (2x + 6y) - (2x + y) = 40 - 30 2x + 6y - 2x - y = 10 5y = 10 y = 2 Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into equation 1 to find x: x + 3(2) = 20 x + 6 = 20 x = 20 - 6 x = 14 Finally, we can find z by substituting the value of x into equation 4: z = x - 5 z = 14 - 5 z = 9 So the solution to the system of equations is: x = 14 y = 2 z = boxed{9}"},{"prompt":"A train crosses a post in some seconds and a platform 100 m long in 25 seconds.

When the train crosses the 100 m long platform, it covers a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the platform. Given that the train is 150 m long and the platform is 100 m long, the total distance covered when crossing the platform is 150 m + 100 m = 250 m.

Now, we need to find (x) and (y) such that (x + y = 130) and (x = c), (y = d). From equations (5) and (6), we have: [ c = 130 - d ] 11. Let (x = c) and (y = d). Then: [ x = 130 - y ] 12. The difference (|x - y|) is: [ |x - y| = |(130 - y) - y| = |130 - 2y| ] 13. Since (c + d = 130), we have (c = frac{117}{2}) and (d = frac{143}{2}).

Thus: [ widehat{PAR} = widehat{BCA}. ] - Similarly, the angle widehat{PCS} equals widehat{BCA} because it is subtended by chord PC. 5. **Setting up the Equations**: Using the results from the Tangential Angle Theorem and the Angle Bisector Theorem, we write: [ widehat{PRA} = widehat{SPC}. ] 6. **Summing Internal Angles**: Considering the internal angles at points R and S: [ widehat{PRA} = 180^circ - widehat{PAR} - widehat{RPA} ] and similarly for point S: [ widehat{PRA} = 180^circ - widehat{SBP} - widehat{BPS}. ] 7. **Concluding Equality by Substitution**: Since widehat{PAR} = widehat{BCA} = widehat{PCS} and widehat{RPA} = widehat{SPC}, we have: [ widehat{PRA} = 180^circ - widehat{PAR} - widehat{RPA} = widehat{PSC}. ] 8. **Conclusion**: Since widehat{ARS} = widehat{ASR}, triangle ARS is isosceles at A.

Determine (a_{1998}).","completion":"To solve for (a_{1998}), we first recognize the form and the nature of the given sequence. The sequence (a_0, a_1, ldots) must be strictly increasing and each nonnegative integer must be uniquely expressible in the form ( a_i + 2a_j + 4a_k ) for ( i, j, k ) not necessarily distinct. Step 1: Identifying the Sequence (a_n) Given the conditions in the problem, let's explore the initial terms: - We start with (a_0 = 0). - Continuing, we need to find the subsequent terms such that each integer has a unique representation in the given form. By carefully examining how ( a_i+2a_j+4a_k ) covers all integers uniquely, we notice that the sequence (a_n) must correspond to numbers that use only the digits 0 and 1 when expressed in base 8. Step 2: Considering Base 8 Representation To express necessary integers based on these conditions, we recognize the pattern involved in base 8. The sequence should be formed by numbers like: - ( 0 ): represented as (0) - ( 1 ): represented as (1) - ( 8 ): which is (10_8) - ( 9 ): which is (11_8) - ( 64 ): which is (100_8) - and so forth.

Since the sequence is arithmetic, the average of any three consecutive terms is equal to the middle term, which means a_5 = 10. To find a_{10}+a_{11}+a_{12}, we first note that the sum of these three terms is equal to 3 times the average of the three terms, which is also equal to 3 times the middle term, a_{11}.

However, this calculation seems to have a mistake since the common difference cannot be 0 if S_6 - S_3 = 30. Let's correct the approach. The correct way to find the common difference d is by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S_n = frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d].

This implies x=2-t. - Substituting x=2-t into the function, we get f(t)=2-(2-t)+frac{1}{a+(2-t)-2}=2-t+frac{1}{a+t-2}. - Therefore, the function can be rewritten as f(x)=2-x+frac{1}{x-2+a}. 2. **Analyzing the Given Condition**: - We are given that for any 1 < x_{1} < x_{2} < 4, it holds that frac{f({x}_{1})-f({x}_{2})}{{x}_{1}-{x}_{2}}＜-1. - This can be rearranged to f(x_{1})-f(x_{2}) > -(x_{1}-x_{2}), which further simplifies to f(x_{1})+x_{1} > f(x_{2})+x_{2}. 3. **Defining a New Function**: - Let's define a new function g(x)=f(x)+x=2+frac{1}{x-2+a}. - From the condition f(x_{1})+x_{1} > f(x_{2})+x_{2} for 1 < x_{1} < x_{2} < 4, we deduce that g(x_{1}) > g(x_{2}).

Consider two independent coverings: one using only red dominoes, called the red covering, and the other using only blue dominoes, called the blue covering. Two squares are called red neighbors if and only if they are covered by the same domino in the red covering. Similarly, blue neighbors are defined. If it is possible to write a nonzero integer in each square such that this integer is the difference between the number in its red neighbor and the number in its blue neighbor, prove that ( n ) is divisible by 3.","completion":"1. Consider the graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of all squares of the 2n times 2n grid. 2. Two squares are connected by an edge if and only if they are either red neighbors or blue neighbors. 3. Clearly, a square's red neighbors and blue neighbors are distinct (i.e., a square cannot be both a red neighbor and a blue neighbor, otherwise the number written on that square would be 0, which contradicts the problem statement). 4. Hence, each vertex has degree 2, implying that the graph G is a union of disjoint cycles. Next, we need to show that each cycle length is a multiple of 3, establishing that 3 mid n. 5. Assume C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k are the cycles, and without loss of generality, let C_1 be a cycle consisting of vertices labeled S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k. 6. If S_i and S_{i+1} are red neighbors when i is odd, then S_i and S_{i+1} are blue neighbors when i is even (thanks to the definition of red and blue neighbors and the even degree of each vertex). 7. Working under modulo k notation, assume a_i is the non-zero integer written in square S_i. 8. It follows that: [ a_{2i} = a_{2i-1} - a_{2i+1} ] [ a_{2i+1} = a_{2i+2} - a_{2i} ] 9. From a_{2i+1} = a_{2i+2} - a_{2i}, substitute the expression recursively: [ a_{2i+1} = a_{2i+2} - (a_{2i-1} - a_{2i+1}) ] simplifying we get: [ a_{2i+1} = a_{2i+2} - a_{2i-1} + a_{2i+1} ] thus: [ a_{2i-1} - a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+3} = 0 ] 10. Similarly: [ a_{2i+1} - a_{2i+3} + a_{2i+5}=0 ] 11. By summing equations cyclically, we get: [ a_{2i-1} + a_{2i+5} = 0 implies a_{2i-1} = -a_{2i+5} ] 12. Using mathematical induction: For odd index j and integer m, we have: [ a_{6m+j} = (-1)^m a_j ] 13. If k equiv 2 pmod{6}: [ a_1 = a_{k+1} = pm a_3, quad a_5 = a_{k+5} = mp a_1 = -a_3 ] From (1), we know: [ a_1 - a_3 + a_5 = 0 ] thus, (a_3 = 0), which is contradictory. 14.

Thus, for all cases: [ k equiv 0 pmod{6} ] which implies that for the cycle length k, 3 must divide k. Hence, n^2 must be divisible by 3. Since n is a positive integer, it follows that 3 mid n.

Consider the sum: [ S = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n ] 3. **Count the contribution of each edge**: Each edge of the polyhedron, which is not traversed by the broken line, contributes twice (as it is shared by two faces). Thus, the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum ( S ) does not depend on such edges. 4. **Edges traversed by the broken line**: Each edge on the broken line contributes exactly once to the sum ( S ). Given that the broken line visits each of the 2003 vertices exactly once, it must traverse 2003 edges. 5. **Parity of the total sum ( S )**: Since each edge on the broken line contributes once, and there are 2003 such edges, the sum of these contributions is 2003, which is odd. Therefore, the sum ( S ) is odd. 6. **Conclude regarding odd-sided faces**: For the sum ( S ) to be odd, the number of terms ( a_i ) that are themselves odd must also be odd.

Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Reflecting Point (B) in the Angle Bisector (l):** Let (B') be the reflection of (B) in the internal angle bisector (l) of (angle A). By definition, (B') is such that (l) is the perpendicular bisector of the segment (BB'). 2. **Concyclic Points:** We need to show that the points (B, C, B', I) are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle. To do this, we will use the fact that the reflection of a point in the angle bisector of an angle preserves the angle measures. 3. **Angle Preservation:** Since (B') is the reflection of (B) in (l), the angles (angle AB'I) and (angle ABI) are equal. Similarly, (angle CB'I) and (angle CBI) are equal. This implies that (angle CB'I = angle CBI). 4. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Since (angle CBI = angle CB'I), the points (B, C, B', I) form a cyclic quadrilateral. This is because opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to (180^circ). 5. **Circumcenter of (triangle CB'I):** The circumcenter of a triangle is the point equidistant from all three vertices. For the triangle (CB'I), the circumcenter must lie on the perpendicular bisector of each side of the triangle. 6. **Perpendicular Bisector and Angle Bisector:** The perpendicular bisector of (BB') is the angle bisector (l) of (angle A). Since (B') is the reflection of (B) in (l), the circumcenter of (triangle CB'I) must lie on (l). 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the circumcenter of the triangle (CB'I) lies on the internal angle bisector (l) of (angle A).

This is because each cut divides one segment into two, and thus, ( n ) cuts create ( n+1 ) segments. 2. **Identifying number of cuts**: - According to the problem: - Red rings yield 5 pieces, which means it has ( 5 - 1 = 4 ) cuts. - Yellow rings yield 7 pieces, which means it has ( 7 - 1 = 6 ) cuts. - Green rings yield 11 pieces, which means it has ( 11 - 1 = 10 ) cuts.

Consider the triangle ( triangle ABC ) with distinct side lengths, and the points where the incircle touches the sides ( BC, CA, AB ) as ( K, L, M ), respectively. We aim to show that the segment ( DE ), where ( D ) and ( E ) are constructed in a specific manner, passes through the midpoint of ( LM ). 2. Let us construct the lines through ( B ) and ( C ) parallel to ( LM ). These lines intersect ( KL ) and ( KM ) at points ( D ) and ( E ), respectively. 3. To proceed, denote the intersection of ( BD ) with ( AC ) by ( B' ), and the intersection of ( CE ) with ( AB ) by ( C' ). 4. In ( triangle ALM ), we note that both ( triangle AB'B ) and ( triangle ACC' ) are similar to ( triangle ALM ) due to the equal angles arising from the tangency points and parallel lines. 5. Next, we use the property that the external tangent segments from a point outside a circle are equal in length. Therefore, ( BK = BM ) and similarly, comparing appropriate segments in the tangent points’ triangles, ( B'D = BD ) and ( C'E = CE ). 6. These relationships confirm that ( D ) and ( E ) are midpoints of ( BB' ) and ( CC' ), respectively. 7. Further, because ( BD parallel LM parallel CE ), we have that ( BD ) and ( CE ) will create corresponding segments on ( KM ) and ( KL ) respectively which are proportional to their respective base segments ( KL ) and ( KM ). 8. By establishing these midpoints, we have effectively divided the intersections and parallel constructs into segments that equally bisect. Hence, ( DE ) must pass through the midpoint of ( LM ) because both constructions ( D ) and ( E ) symmetrically divide the triangle's sides and its analogous segments. 9. Reinforcing this, consider circumcircle arguments where the points ( B, K, D ) and ( M ) lie on a common circle ( k_1 ), and similarly the points ( C, K, E ), and ( L ) on another circle ( k_2 ). Their intersections and alignments provide another symmetry argument around the incircle's center. 10. Finally, using properties of Menelaus’ theorem in the triangle’s specific construction bolsters the proof, showing through geometric proportional relationships among segments that ( DE ) indeed bisects ( LM ).

Therefore, the midpoint of AB has an x-coordinate of -1. Given x_1 + x_2 = 6, the x-coordinates of A and B are symmetric about the directrix. Thus, we can find that x_1 = 2 and x_2 = 4 or vice versa.

First, we need to analyze the behavior of the exponential function (a^x) when (0 < a < 1). Notice that for values of (a) in this range, the function (y = a^x) is a decreasing function.

This is because raising a number less than 1 to a power that is also less than 1 results in a larger number. 3. **Next sequence value:** [ x_3 = a^{x_2} = a^{a^a}. ] Again, since (a^a < 1), raising (a) to a power (a^a) which is less than 1 results in a value greater than (a^a), hence (a^a > a^{a^a}). 4. **General pattern deduction:** - [ x_2 = a^a < a ] - [ x_3 = a^{a^a} < x_2 = a^a < a ] 5.

[Solution] Given the function f(x)= frac{ln x-2x}{x}, its derivative is f'(x)= frac{1-ln x}{{x}^{2}}. Substitute x=1 to get the slope of the tangent line k=1. Thus, the equation of the tangent line is: y+2=x-1, or equivalently, x-y-3=0. Hence, the answer is boxed{x-y-3=0}. (3) [Analysis] This problem tests the understanding of function's odd-even symmetry, monotonicity, and domain. First, use the function's odd symmetry to obtain the function expression's condition, then simplify the original inequality, utilizing the function's monotonicity to obtain the relationship between the independent variable, and finally solve the inequality. [Solution] Given that f(x) is an odd function defined on (-1,1), f(x) is a decreasing function on its domain, and f(m-2)>f(-2m+3), we have begin{cases}begin{matrix}-1 < m-2 < 1 -1 < -2m+3 < 1 m-2 < -2m+3end{matrix}end{cases}.

(4) [Analysis] This problem tests the understanding of a function's monotonicity properties, specifically those of quadratic functions and exponential functions. Utilize the number-shape combination thinking in the analysis of this problem. From f(x) being increasing on (0,+infty), it can be deduced that y=a^{x}-a is increasing, and that 1+frac{1}{2}a-2leqslant a^{1}-a. From this, an inequality group relation regarding a can be obtained and solved.

If we denote: - ( r_2 ) as the probability of the number being correct with exactly two erroneous digits, - ( r_3 ) as the probability of the number being correct with all three digits erroneous, then we can use the following binomial coefficients and probabilities: [ C_{3}^{2} p^{2}(1-p) quad text{and} quad C_{3}^{3} p^{3} ] where ( C_{3}^{2} ) and ( C_{3}^{3} ) are binomial coefficients representing combinations. 3. **Calculations:** The total probability that an erroneous number turns out to be correct is given by: [ C_{3}^{2} p^{2}(1-p) r_{2} + C_{3}^{3} p^{3} r_{3} ] 4. **Details and Example for Two Errors:** If two digits are erroneous, for any given first erroneous digit, the second erroneous digit must be chosen correctly from 9 possible values (since there are 10 digits total).

After all the students have passed, how many lockers remain closed?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup:** - A school has 100 lockers numbered from 1 to 100. - Initially, all lockers are closed. 2. **Sequential Operations:** - The first student opens all the lockers. So, lockers numbered 1 through 100 are opened. - The second student then closes all lockers with even numbers (multiples of 2). This will close lockers 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. - The third student toggles the state of all lockers that are multiples of 3. For instance, lockers 3, 6, 9, ..., 99. This means if the locker is open, it will be closed, and if it is closed, it will be opened. - The fourth student toggles all multiples of 4 such as 4, 8, 12, ..., 100. - This pattern continues with the (n)-th student toggling the state of every locker that is a multiple of (n). 3. **Understanding Toggling:** - A locker's final state (open or closed) depends on the number of times it has been toggled. - A locker (k) is toggled each time a divisor of (k) (i.e., a number (d) such that (k div d) is an integer) is encountered. 4. **Divisors and Perfect Squares:** - The critical observation here is that a number is toggled an odd number of times if and only if it has an odd number of divisors. - Typically, every number (n) has an even number of divisors because they come in pairs. For example, if 12 is divisible by 3 (one divisor), it is also divisible by 4 (another divisor that paired with 3). - However, perfect squares have an odd number of divisors because one of its divisors is a repeated number (the square root). For instance, 36 has divisors {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36} where 6 appears alone in the middle, thus contributing an odd count. - Therefore, a locker will end up being open if and only if its number is a perfect square. 5. **List of Perfect Squares from 1 to 100:** - The perfect squares between 1 and 100 are: (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, 9^2, 10^2), which are: (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100). - Thus, there are 10 perfect squares. 6. **Conclusion:** - Since there are 10 lockers that will remain open (those numbered with perfect squares), the number of lockers that remain closed is given by subtracting the number of open lockers from the total number of lockers: 100 - 10 = 90 [ boxed{90} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the complex number z=(2+ai)(ai), where a in mathbb{R} and i is the imaginary unit, the corresponding point of z is in the third quadrant of the complex plane.

This means that the tetrahedron (A-BCD) can be unfolded such that triangles ( triangle ABC), (triangle ACD), and (triangle ABD ) all lie in the plane of (triangle BCD). 2. **Analyze the relationships of vertices:** Since (angle ABD + angle CBD + angle ABC = 180^circ), points (A_1), (B), and (A_2) lie collinear, and similarly for other points.

Let's outline the solution step by step: 1. **Definition and Initial Setup**: - A natural number s is called n -representable if the sum ( s ) can be paid with coins of denominations ( 2^n, 2^{n-1} cdot 3, ldots, 3^n ). - For n = 1 , the available denominations are ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) piastres. 2. **Base Case**: - Check for ( n = 1 ): - If ( s geq 3 ), then there exists ( r in {0,1} ) such that ( (s - 3r) ) is even. Hence, ( s ) can be written as ( 3r + 2k ), proving that s is 1-representable. - The number 2 is also 1-representable. - The number 1 is not 1-representable. - Therefore, the largest 1-non-representable number is ( 1 = 3^2 - 2^3 ). 3. **Induction Hypothesis**: - Assume for some ( n ), the number ( 3^{n+1} - 2^{n+2} ) is n -non-representable. We will prove that if ( s > 3^{n+1} - 2^{n+2} ), the number ( s ) is n -representable. 4. **Inductive Step**: - Suppose ( s = 3^{n+1} - 2^{n+2} ) is ( n )-representable. Then, assume it can be written using ( m ) coins of ( 3^n ) denomination where ( m < 3 ), and ( 3^{n+1} - m cdot 3^n ) is even. - Therefore, m = 1 , and there exist non-negative integers ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_n ) such that: [ s = 3^n + k_1 cdot 3^{n-1} cdot 2 + ldots + k_n cdot 2^n ] - Then, it follows that: [ 3^n - 2^{n+1} = frac{s - 3^n}{2} = k_1 cdot 3^{n-1} + k_2 cdot 3^{n-2} cdot 2 + ldots + k_n cdot 2^{n-1} ] - This contradicts our assumption that ( 3^n - 2^{n+1} ) cannot be expressed by smaller denominations, thus proving it is ( n )-non-representable. 5. **Proof for All ( s > 3^{n+1} - 2^{n+2} ) Being ( n )-representable**: - If ( s > 3^{n+1} - 2^{n+2} ), then choose ( r in {0,1} ) such that ( s - r cdot 3^n ) is even. - Let ( N = frac{s - r cdot 3^n}{2} ), then: [ N > frac{3^{n+1} - 2^{n+2} - r cdot 3^n}{2} = frac{(3-r) 3^n - 2^{n+2}}{2} geq frac{2 cdot 3^n - 2 cdot 2^{n+1}}{2} = 3^n - 2^{n+1} ] - By the inductive hypothesis, ( N ) is ( (n-1) )-representable, so there exist non-negative integers ( k_1, ldots, k_n ) such that: [ N = k_1 cdot 3^{n-1} + k_2 cdot 3^{n-2} cdot 2 + ldots + k_n cdot 2^{n-1} ] - Thus: [ s = r cdot 3^n + k_1 cdot 3^{n-1} cdot 2 + ldots + k_n cdot 2^n ] - This confirms that s is ( n )-representable. # Conclusion: The largest sum that cannot be given in the bank is: [ boxed{3^{n+1} - 2^{n+2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Among 8 consecutive natural numbers, there are k numbers such that any two of them are relatively prime.

(b) How many times does the digit 1 appear? (c) Considering that 1 occupies position 1, 2 occupies position 2, and 0 appears for the first time occupying position 11, which digit occupies position 2016?","completion":"Part (a): We need to determine the total number of digits written from 1 to 999. We can break this down into three parts: 1. **Numbers with one digit**: These are the numbers from 1 to 9. Thus, there are 9 digits in this range. 2. **Numbers with two digits**: These are the numbers from 10 to 99. There are (99 - 10 + 1 = 90) numbers in this category. Each of these numbers has 2 digits. 3. **Numbers with three digits**: These are the numbers from 100 to 999. There are (999 - 100 + 1 = 900) numbers in this category. Each of these numbers has 3 digits. Therefore, the total number of digits is calculated as follows: [ begin{align*} & 9 cdot 1 + 90 cdot 2 + 900 cdot 3 &= 9 + 180 + 2700 &= 2889 end{align*} ] Conclusion: The total number of digits written is: [ boxed{2889} ] Part (b): To find how many times the digit 1 appears, we again consider the numbers in three categories: 1. **Numbers with one digit**: The digit 1 appears only once. 2. **Numbers with two digits**: The digit 1 appears both as a tens place and as a units place. - **As a tens digit**: The numbers 10-19 contain the digit 1 in the tens place.

This occurs 9 times. - Total appearances in two-digit numbers: (10+9 = 19). 3. **Numbers with three digits**: The digit 1 can appear in the hundreds, tens, and units places. - **As a hundreds digit**: The numbers 100-199 contain the digit 1 as the hundreds place. This gives us 100 appearances. - **As a tens digit**: The digit 1 can appear as a tens place within each hundred from 100-199, 200-299, ..., 900-999. In each hundred (e.g., 110-119, 210-219,...), the digit 1 appears 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, this happens 9 times (one for each hundred). - **As a units digit**: Similarly, the digit 1 can appear as a units place within each hundred. The same 10 appearances happen 9 times per hundred (one for each hundred). - Total appearances in three-digit numbers: (100 + 9 times 10 + 9 times 10 = 100 + 90 + 90 = 280).

Next, calculate how many three-digit numbers we need to cover 1827 positions: Each three-digit number contributes 3 positions. Therefore, divide the remaining positions by 3: [ frac{1827}{3} = 609 ] This means the 1827th position is the last digit of the 609th three-digit number (starting from 100). 3. Determine the 609th three-digit number: [ 100 + 608 = 708 ] Thus, the last digit of 708 (which is 8) occupies the 2016th position in the sequence.

Therefore, the graph of y=x^{ frac{1}{2}} does not pass through the fixed point (0, 1), and option C is incorrect. For option D, when x=0, y=x^2=0^2=0. Similarly, the graph of y=x^2 does not pass through the fixed point (0, 1), which means option D is incorrect. For option A, when x=0, y=2^x=2^0=1. The graph of y=2^x passes through the fixed point (0, 1), making option A the correct choice. Additionally, the problem explores the properties of exponential and logarithmic functions regarding fixed points on their graphs.

A similar approach can be applied to determine the fixed points that the graph of an exponential function passes through. The key examination point here is the monotonicity and special points of the logarithmic function. We need to address the issue of the logarithmic function always passing through a fixed point.

This implies that P(n) can have prime factors not in mathbb{S}, contradicting the assumption that mathbb{S} is finite. Therefore, P(x) must be a constant polynomial. Since P(x) is not the zero polynomial, it must be a non-zero constant polynomial.

(ii) Any two different pairs play against each other at most once. (iii) Participants who are in the same pair do not meet as opponents in any match. To identify the number of doubles matches each participant plays, we define the set of all distinct numbers of matches played as the game number set. Given a set ( A = left{ a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{k} right} ) composed of different positive integers, each of which is divisible by 6, determine the minimum number of participants needed for the event to schedule a match plan that adheres to the aforementioned rules and makes the resulting game number set exactly ( A ). Prove your conclusion.","completion":"To find the minimum number of participants needed to arrange matches such that their counts form the set ( A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} ) where each ( a_i ) is divisible by 6, we need to follow the given constraints and definitions. Let's detail the solution step-by-step. 1. **Initial Setup**: Let ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_k ) represent the counts of matches each participant engages in. 2. **Constraint Analysis for Participant (alpha)**: - Each participant (alpha) can be part of at most 2 teams. - No team can play more than once with any other team. - If a participant is part of a team, they do not face their team members in other matches. 3. **Case Analysis for Maximum Count ( a_k )**: - **Case 1**: Suppose participant (alpha) is part of only one team. Assume (alpha) is in a team that competes (a_k) times. Each of these (a_k) matches could involve different opponents. There must be (a_k) other teams, leading to (2a_k) potential opponents. By the constraints, each individual can only be part of 2 teams. Therefore, there must be at least (a_k) distinct participants. Hence, the total number of participants must be at least (a_k + 2). - **Case 2**: Suppose participant (alpha) is part of two different teams. Then, the remaining matches involve (frac{a_k}{2}) pairs of these two teams competing. Thus, there should be (frac{a_k}{2}) additional participants to ensure (a_k) matches for (alpha). This calculates the total number of participants to be (frac{a_k}{2} + 3). 4. **Least Upper Bound Calculation**: These participants need to be organized specifically such that each participant belongs exactly to 2 different teams and the match counts adhere to forming the set ( A = {a_1, a_2, cdots, a_k} ). 5. **Verification Through Induction**: - For ( k = 1 ): - Consider the smallest set such as ( {a_1} ), where (a_1) must be divisible by 6. - The match count set to have ( frac{a_1}{2} + 3 ) participants where each of the participants forms pairs in groups of three: - Each group forms teams, ensuring each participant is in 2 teams. - Since they're competing precisely (a_1) times across these groups: [ frac{a_1}{2} times 2 = a_1 ] Thus, this configuration works for ( k = 1 ). - For ( k = 2 ): - When ( A = {a_1, a_2} ) where ( a_1 < a_2 ), - Split participants into two groups ( S ) and ( T ): - ( |S| = frac{a_1}{2} ) - ( |T| = frac{a_2 - a_1}{2} + 3 ) - By setting pairs in three-person groups within ( S ) and ( T ), and ensuring sufficient pairing against each other: - Each match configuration yields: [ a_1 text{ matches from each } text{participant in } S ] [ a_2 text{ matches for each in the combination} ] - Inductive step ( k = h + 1 ): - Extending the argument to ensure the configuration works beyond 2, essentially by using the mathematical grouping strategy and ensuring iterative completeness by combining larger groups and verifying matches exactly form the defined set. 6. **Conclusion**: Through detailed examination and inductive verification, it is apparent that the number of participants needed to form such match counts sets must be: [ frac{a_k}{2} + 3 ] This confirms our initial hypothesis and proves the required setup is achievable under the stated constraints. Therefore, the minimum number of participants required to ensure the match counts form the set ( A ) is (boxed{frac{a_k}{2} + 3})."},{"prompt":"Compute [sum_{k=3}^{100} log_3left(1 + frac{1}{k}right) log_k 3 log_{k+1} 3.]","completion":"First, we rewrite the summand using logarithmic identities: [ log_3left(1+frac{1}{k}right) log_k 3 log_{k+1} 3 = frac{log_3left(frac{k+1}{k}right)}{log_3 k log_3 (k+1)} = frac{log_3(k+1) - log_3 k}{log_3 k log_3 (k+1)} = frac{1}{log_3 k} - frac{1}{log_3 (k+1)}. ] Thus, the sum becomes a telescoping series: [ sum_{k=3}^{100} left(frac{1}{log_3 k} - frac{1}{log_3 (k+1)}right) = left(frac{1}{log_3 3} - frac{1}{log_3 4}right) + left(frac{1}{log_3 4} - frac{1}{log_3 5}right) + dots + left(frac{1}{log_3 100} - frac{1}{log_3 101}right). ] The series telescopes to: [ frac{1}{log_3 3} - frac{1}{log_3 101} = 1 - frac{1}{log_3 101}. ] By simplifying, we get: [ boxed{1 - frac{1}{log_3 101}}. ]"},{"prompt":"Find the missing number in the expression: 0.72 * 0.43 + 0.12 * missing_number = 0.3504.

Given any 6 points on the Cartesian coordinate plane, how many of these lines formed by connecting any two points are standard lines?","completion":"Given a set of 6 points on the Cartesian plane, we want to determine the maximum number of lines formed by any two points that can be parallel to either the (x)-axis, (y)-axis, or the lines (y = pm x). Let's denote the set of the 6 points as (A) and consider two arbitrary points from (A). From these points, a line can be formed, and we want to find the maximum number of such lines that are \\"standard lines\\" (parallel to the axes or the diagonals). 1. **Defining Sets and Calculating Maximum Instances:** Define (k) as the number of standard lines, and let (B) be the set of these (k) standard lines. For each point (a in A), the number of standard lines it can lie on is at most 4 because the lines could either be parallel to the (x)-axis, (y)-axis, or the diagonals (y = x) and (y = -x). Therefore: [ |S| leq 4 |A| = 4 cdot 6 = 24 ] 2. **Relation between Number of Standard Lines and Points:** For each standard line (l in B), (l) must pass through at least 2 points from (A) since we're considering lines formed by pairs of points from (A). Hence: [ |S| geq 2 |B| = 2k ] 3. **Bounding the Maximum Number of Standard Lines:** Combining the inequalities, we get: [ 2k leq 24 implies k leq 12 ] Now let’s test if (k = 12) is possible. If (k = 12), then the equality (2k = 24) holds, which means every point (a in A) must be on exactly 4 different standard lines. 4. **Position Consideration and Rectangular Region (D):** To arrange the points in such a way that each point lies on exactly 4 standard lines, we can place the 6 points in a manner ensuring these lines are achieved. Consider a rectangular region (D) where each side of the rectangle is parallel to the (x)- and (y)-axes and all 6 points are either on the boundary or inside (D). Each side of (D) must have at least one point (a in A), ensuring each point lies on standard lines. However, this configuration must be checked for all possible arrangements to ensure it does not violate any condition like the existence of points not lying on any standard lines. 5. **Feasibility Check:** Considering practical arrangement examples with combinatorial arguments shows that the best configuration which respects all constraints is with 11 distinct standard lines. Therefore, the assumption (k = 12) cannot hold without violating the unique pairs' condition, leaving (k = 11 as the best possible maximum number of standard lines.

So the equation simplifies to: [ x_0^4 + y_0^4 = z_0^2 ] 4. **Applying Fermat's Last Theorem Analogy**: According to Fermat's Last Theorem, there are no positive integer solutions to the equation (a^n + b^n = c^n) for any integer (n > 2). In this case, (n = 4) for the terms involving (x_0) and (y_0), and (n = 2) for the term involving (z_0), which doesn't directly fit the form of Fermat's Last Theorem. However, a similar principle applies since: - If (x_0^4 + y_0^4 = z_0^2) had any positive integer solutions, this would contradict results from the more general form of Fermat's Last Theorem as it relates to higher powers (specifically n=4). 5. **Conclusion Using Infinite Descent Method**: Moreover, we can apply the method of infinite descent. Suppose there is a solution ((x_0, y_0, z_0)) with positive integers. One could construct a smaller solution by repeatedly reducing it. This leads to an infinite sequence of positive integers, which is impossible. Therefore, there cannot be any solution in positive integers ((x_0, y_0, z_0)). # Conclusion: Hence, the equation (x^{4004} + y^{4004} = z^{2002}) has no positive integer solutions.

However, there is an error; the condition stating 2m < 1 - m yields 3m < 1, which simplifies further to 0 < m < frac{1}{3}. There appears to be an inconsistency in the original solution, so we revise the inequality to 0 < m < frac{1}{3}. For proposition q, the eccentricity is given by e = frac{sqrt{5+m}}{sqrt{5}}, which must be greater than 1 and less than 2 for q to be true. Squaring both sides of 1 < e < 2 and rearranging gives us: 1 < left(frac{sqrt{5+m}}{sqrt{5}}right)^2 < 4 This simplifies to: 1 < frac{5+m}{5} < 4 Further simplification yields: 5 < 5 + m < 20 After subtracting 5 from all parts of the inequality, we get: 0 < m < 15 So we have 0 < m < 15 for proposition q to represent a hyperbola with the given eccentricity conditions. Since p wedge q is false, but p vee q is true, either proposition p is false and q is true, or p is true and q is false.

The coordinates of ( Q ) are: [ x_Q = a^3, quad y_Q = b^3 ] 6. Since these equations hold for any point ( P ) on the circle, by substitution, we have: [ x = a^3 implies a = x^{1/3}, quad y = b^3 implies b = y^{1/3} ] Given the relationship ( a^2 + b^2 = 1 ), substituting ( a ) and ( b ): [ (x^{2/3}) + (y^{2/3}) = 1 ] This shows that ( Q )'s coordinates indeed satisfy the given equation. This proves that the locus of ( Q ) is the curve ( g ). Step b) Tangent properties and symmetry The astroid ( g ) is symmetric with respect to the ( x )-axis, ( y )-axis, and the lines ( x = y ), and ( x = -y ). To analyze the tangents at a generic internal point ( Q(x, y) ): 1. Express ( y ) as a function of ( x ): [ y = y(x) = left(1 - x^{2/3}right)^{3/2} ] This is differentiable in ((0, 1)), and the derivative (tangent slope) is: [ y' = frac{d}{dx}left[left(1 - x^{2/3}right)^{3/2}right] = frac{3}{2}left(1 - x^{2/3}right)^{1/2} cdot left(-frac{2}{3}right) x^{-1/3} = -left(frac{y}{x}right)^{1/3} ] Thus, the equation of the tangent parallel to the slope obtained above confirms the consistency with the symmetry lines. Step c) Square formation from intersection points To find the side length of squares formed by the intersection points: 1. From the symmetry of ( g ), consider four points forming half the octagon's properties: If ( Q(x, y) ) lies in the first quadrant, its reflections form additional tangent points around the origin due to the rotational symmetry of ( g ).

Since g(1) = e - 2 > 0, we conclude e^{x} > x + 1 for x > 1. 2. **Substituting Inequality**: Using the above property, we have: [ f(x) = e^{x} - ln(x-1) + 1 > (x + 1) - ln(x-1) + 1 = x - ln(x-1) + 2. ] 3. **Simplifying Further**: Since x - ln(x-1) + 2 is always greater than 4 for x > 1, we conclude: [ f(x) > 4. ] Therefore, we have proved that f(x) > 4 for m=1 and x > 1. Part (2) Analysis: 1. **Domain Consideration**: For f(x) to be defined, we need mx - m > 0, implying x > 1 and m > 0. 2. **Function Behavior**: For m > 0 and x > 1, we analyze the condition for f(x) geqslant 0: [ e^{x} + m geqslant mln(mx - m) = mln m + mln(x-1). ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{1}{m}e^{x} + 1 geqslant ln m + ln(x-1). ] Further simplification leads to: [ e^{x - ln m} + (x - ln m) geqslant ln(x-1) + (x-1). ] 3. **Monotonicity of h(x)**: Let h(x) = e^{x} + x. Since h'(x) = e^{x} + 1 > 0, h(x) is monotonically increasing. Thus, we have: [ h(x - ln m) geqslant h[ln(x-1)]. ] 4. **Finding the Minimum of H(x)**: Let H(x) = x - ln(x-1). Its derivative, H'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x-1}, shows that H(x) decreases for x in (1,2) and increases for x in (2, +infty). Therefore, H(x) reaches its minimum at x=2, which is H(2) = 2. 5. **Conclusion**: Since H(x)_{min} = 2, for f(x) geqslant 0 for all x > 1, we need ln m leqslant 2, or equivalently, m leqslant e^{2}. Considering m > 0, the range of values for m is: [ boxed{(0, e^{2}]}. ] This concludes the analysis, showing there exists a real number m within the range (0, e^{2}] such that f(x) geqslant 0 for all x > 1."},{"prompt":"A sports conference has 12 teams arranged into two divisions of 6 teams each.

Our goal is to show that f(x_1) > f(x_2), which would imply that f(x) is monotonically increasing. Given x_1 > x_2 > 0, we can deduce that frac{x_1}{x_2} > 1. From the problem statement, we know that f(x) > 0 whenever x > 1. Therefore, it follows that fleft(frac{x_1}{x_2}right) > 0. Using the functional equation f(xy) = f(x) + f(y), we can rewrite it to isolate f(x) on one side, obtaining f(x) = f(xy) - f(y).

This can be demonstrated by considering an even number as 2k and an odd number as 2j+1 for some integers k and j.

Therefore, if the price is reduced by x dollars, the sales volume increases by 2x items. - **Profit Per Item:** Originally, the profit per item is 50. If the price is reduced by x dollars, the new profit per item becomes (50 - x) dollars. Thus, the daily sales volume of the mall increases by 2x items, and the profit per item is (50 - x) dollars. boxed{2x, (50 - x)} Part 2: Price Reduction for a Daily Profit of 3572 To find the required price reduction x so that the mall's daily profit reaches 3572, we set up the equation based on the profit formula: [ text{Daily Profit} = text{Profit Per Item} times text{Daily Sales Volume} ] Substituting the expressions for profit per item and daily sales volume, we get: [ (50 - x)(70 + 2x) = 3572 ] Expanding and simplifying the equation: [ 3500 + 100x - 70x - 2x^2 = 3572 ] [ -2x^2 + 30x - 72 = 0 ] [ x^2 - 15x + 36 = 0 ] Factoring the quadratic equation: [ (x - 12)(x - 3) = 0 ] Therefore, we have two possible solutions for x: [ x_1 = 12, quad x_2 = 3 ] Given the goal is to reduce inventory quickly, we consider the larger reduction in price.

For x < 0, y' < 0. This means that the function is decreasing, and for x > 0, y' > 0, indicating that the function is increasing. Therefore, at x = 0, we have a minimum: y_{min} = e^0 - 0 = 1 > 0 Thus, we have e^x > x.

Continuing from the previous equations, we have ln(x_2) - e^{x_1} = e^{x_1}(x_2 - x_1). This simplifies to: ln(x_2) = e^{x_1}(x_2 - x_1 + 1) < 0 Thus, x_2 - x_1 + 1 < 0, which implies that x_1 > x_2 + 1.

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get 2a_n = a_n + a_n^2 - a_{n-1} - a_{n-1}^2. 4. Simplifying further, we obtain a_n + a_{n-1} = (a_n + a_{n-1})(a_n - a_{n-1}). 5.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed. Speed of train = 80 kmph Speed of man = 10 kmph Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 80 kmph + 10 kmph Relative speed = 90 kmph Now, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to m/s to match the unit of the length of the train, which is given in meters. To convert kmph to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hour): Relative speed in m/s = 90 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) Relative speed in m/s = 90 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 90000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 25 m/s Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the man is equal to the length of the train, which is 200 meters.

To determine the winning strategy, consider that for the second player to win, they must ensure that they are the one to place the 21st coin in any box. - If the first player skips box 1 on their first move, they will have played their move as 1. - On subsequent turns, to prevent the second player from winning with the 21st coin, the first player must distribute their coins across boxes from 2 to 11 judiciously. 6.

We represent this as a base value of 10 (in tens of thousands) for simplicity. The total production over the first three quarters is given as 364,000 units, or 36.4 in our simplified tens of thousands representation. Given that the growth rates in the second and third quarters are the same, denoted by x, we need to find an equation that correctly represents the situation. The production in the first quarter is 10 (in tens of thousands). For the second quarter, with a growth rate of x, the production would be 10(1+x). For the third quarter, maintaining the same growth rate, the production would be 10(1+x)^2 because the growth rate applies to the already increased production of the second quarter. Adding these productions together to match the total production over the first three quarters gives us the equation: [10 + 10(1+x) + 10(1+x)^2 = 36.4] This equation correctly represents the total production of 364,000 units (or 36.4 in tens of thousands) over the first three quarters, taking into account the consistent growth rate across the second and third quarters.

The number of terms from 30 to 40 is 40 - 30 + 1 = 11 (since we are including both 30 and 40). So, the sum (x) is: x = (11/2) * (30 + 40) = (11/2) * 70 = 11 * 35 = 385 To find the value of y, we need to count the number of even integers from 30 to 40, inclusive.

We'll use mathematical induction on (n). 1. **Base Case:** - For (n = 0): [ P(x) = Q(x) ] Since (Q(x) neq 0), it must have at least one non-zero coefficient. Therefore, the base case holds as (n + 1 = 1) for (n = 0). 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement holds for some (n geq 1), i.e., if (R(x)) is a non-zero polynomial, then ((x-1)^{n-1} R(x)) has at least (n) non-zero coefficients. - We need to show that ((x-1)^{n} Q(x)) has at least (n+1) non-zero coefficients for some non-zero (Q(x)). Suppose (Q(x)) can be expressed as (Q(x) = x^{r} Q_{0}(x)), where (r in mathbb{Z}^{+}) and (Q_{0}(x) neq 0) such that (Q_{0}(0) neq 0).

But by our inductive assumption, ((x-1)^{n-1} R(x)) must have at least (n) non-zero coefficients which contradicts our assumption that (P_{0}(x)) has at most (n) non-zero coefficients. Hence, our assumption must be false, i.e., (P(x)) has at least (n+1) non-zero coefficients.

From the given conditions, we have begin{cases} frac{b}{2} + c > b frac{b}{2} + c < a end{cases}. From frac{b}{2} + c > b, we have 2c > b.

Therefore, the function starts increasing from this vertex onwards. To ensure that f(x) is strictly increasing, and thus does not repeat any value, we should restrict the domain starting from this vertex point. Formally, the function will be strictly increasing on the interval [-1, infty).

The speed of the train is given as 72 kmph. To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s. So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 72 kmph * (5/18) m/s/kmph = 20 m/s The time taken to cross the platform is given as 26 seconds. The distance covered while crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. We can calculate this distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Distance covered = 20 m/s * 26 s = 520 meters This distance is the sum of the lengths of the train and the platform.

We need to determine the longest path that connects two opposite vertices of the rectangle without retracing any edge. 1. **Define the Rectangle and Vertices:** Let the rectangle be denoted by ABCD, with A and C being opposite vertices. 2. **Vertices and Edges of Unit Squares:** The unit squares generate a grid with intersections (vertices) and edges. There are 3+1 = 4 vertices along the height and 5+1 = 6 vertices along the width of the rectangle, giving a total of 4 times 6 = 24 vertices. 3. **Count the Edges:** The number of horizontal edges in the grid is 3 times 5 = 15, and the number of vertical edges in the grid is 4 times 4 = 16. Thus, the total number of edges in the grid is: [ 15 + 16 = 31 ] 4. **Path Length Consideration:** Each path must connect vertices, and since no edge can be traversed twice, we need to determine how many edges each vertex (node) can have. 5. **Degree of Intersections:** Each intersection or node can have a degree of 2 (endpoints), 3 (corner), or 4 (internal node). 6. **Valid Path Constraints:** For the path from A to C to not retrace any edge and connect the endpoints, it should ideally traverse the maximum number of the 31 edges.

However, each internal node traditionally supports 3 additional uses: entry once, exit three times minus one non-returning edge, thus managing more coverage. 9. **Visualizing the Full Path:** Visually, such a path can be traced, and a sound Eulerian connection becomes evident with at least 30 unique edges traversed, such as a serpentine fashion around the rectangle without overlapping sides. 10. **Conclusion:** By analyzing our edges and reiterating across nodes in the grid size constraint, the connective longest path maximizes at: [ 2 times (15 + 15) = 30 ] Thus, the longest path connecting two opposite vertices in the 3 times 5 rectangle without retracing any edge is: [ boxed{30} ]"},{"prompt":"The repeating decimals 0.acacoverline{ac} and 0.abcdabcdoverline{abcd} satisfy [0.acacoverline{ac}+0.abcdabcdoverline{abcd}=frac{17}{37},] where a, b, c, and d are (not necessarily distinct) digits.

The offer is for the second pair of shoes to be half off the original price of the cheaper pair. Since the first pair of shoes is 40, the second pair, which is 60, would not be discounted as the offer applies to the cheaper pair. Therefore, the discount would be 50% of 40, which is 20. So, the total amount before the extra discount would be: First pair of shoes: 40 Second pair of shoes with discount: 60 - 20 = 40 Total amount before extra discount: 40 + 40 = 80 James ended up paying 60 for both pairs of shoes after the extra discount was applied. This means the extra discount was: Total before extra discount - Total paid = 80 - 60 = 20 Now, to find the ratio of the extra discount to the total amount before the extra discount, we divide the extra discount by the total amount before the extra discount: Extra discount / Total before extra discount = 20 / 80 To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by 20: (20 / 20) / (80 / 20) = 1 / 4 So, the ratio of the extra discount to the total amount before the extra discount is boxed{1:4} ."},{"prompt":"Below is the graph of an ellipse, where it is assumed that tick marks are placed every 1 unit along the axes.

Case m = -1 follows a similar pattern, and thus for rational x, the maximum value is also 2.

Therefore, each vertex of G has degree 2.** 4. **Consider any two vertices A and B of Pi collinear with P. By the definition of a pivot point, P lies on the interior of Pi, so A, P, and B are collinear in this order. Similarly, for any two vertices A and B of Pi collinear with Q, A, Q, and B are collinear in this order.** 5. **For a vertex V_1 of G, consider the sequence of adjacent vertices V_1, V_2, V_3, dots such that V_i neq V_{i+2}. Each successive term of this sequence is a vertex not contained previously in the sequence. Since there are a finite number of distinct vertices, this sequence must eventually return to V_1. Therefore, each vertex of G is contained in a cycle.** 6. **Let V_1, V_2, V_3, dots, V_m be one such cycle with period m containing a vertex V_1. Since each vertex has a red and blue edge incident to it, m must be even. This follows from counting the total number of red edges: each vertex has exactly one red edge incident to it, and each red edge is counted twice from the two vertices connected to it, giving a total of frac{m}{2} red edges. If m were odd, the number of red edges would not be an integer.** 7. **Consider a plane containing line V_{m-1}V_m not containing any other vertices of Pi. Such a plane exists because there are finitely many vertices of Pi and infinitely many angles at which we can form a plane containing V_{m-1}V_m. Call this plane the \\"blue plane\\". This plane divides space into two sides: the \\"left side\\" containing V_1 and the \\"right side\\".** 8. **We assert that any blue edge contains a vertex on each side of the blue plane. This follows from the fact that for any two vertices A and B of Pi collinear with Q, A, Q, and B are collinear in this order. Therefore, V_1 is on the left side, V_2 is on the right side, V_3 is on the left side, V_4 is on the right side, and in general V_{2i-1} is on the left side and V_{2i} is on the right side, except for V_{m-1} and V_m which lie on the blue plane.** 9. **Since V_{m-1}V_m is a blue edge, V_{m-2}V_{m-1} is a red edge. Since m is even, V_{m-2} lies on the right side of the blue plane. V_{m-2}, P, and V_{m-1} are collinear in that order. Thus, the line V_{m-2}P intersects the blue plane at a point other than V_{m-1}, which is a contradiction because two lines can intersect only once. Therefore, a convex polyhedron cannot have two pivot points.** 10. **Now, we prove that n=1 works. Consider a cube (which is a convex polyhedron) with the pivot point as the center of the cube. By symmetry, each line connecting a vertex of the cube through the center of the cube also passes through the opposite vertex.

Any two cells sharing a common side do not have the same number. 2. For any ( 1 times 3 ) or ( 3 times 1 ) subgrid, the numbers filled do not contain ( 1, 2, 3 ) in that order, regardless of the reading direction. 3. The sum of numbers in any ( n times n ) subgrid is the same. 2. **Analyzing the Grid:** - We start by analyzing the placement of the number ( 2 ) since it is the most restricted by condition 2. - If there are no ( 2 )'s, the grid must be a checkerboard pattern of ( 1 ) and ( 3 ). This can be easily eliminated by condition 3. - If the ( 2 )'s form a checkerboard pattern, this can also be eliminated using condition 3. 3. **Lemma:** - **Lemma:** The 4 adjacent cells (buddies) of any cell labeled ( 2 ) have equal labels. - **Proof:** - Label the cell with ( 2 ) as ((0,0)) in the coordinate plane. - By condition 2, the two numbers to the left and right of a ( 2 ) must be equal. - Assume the 4 buddies are not all equal. We must have a configuration like: [ begin{array}{ccc} & 3 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 3 & end{array} ] - This configuration leads to a periodic pattern with period 2 along the rows and columns, implying ( 2 )'s appear in a checkerboard fashion, which contradicts our earlier elimination.

We use induction on ( a+b ). - Base case ( a+b = 1 ) is clear. - Suppose ( a+b ) is odd. We know ((a-1,b)) is ( 2 ) or ( 1 ) by induction. - If ((a-1,b) = 2), then ((a-2,b) = 3), so ((a,b) = 3). - If ((a-1,b) = 1), then ((a,b)) is ( 2 ) or ( 3 ). - This proves the claim for ( a+b ) odd. The case for ( a+b ) even is similar.

Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 102 × (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 102 × (10 / 36) Speed in m/s = 1020 / 36 Speed in m/s = 28.333... m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the distance the train travels while crossing the platform: Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 28.333... m/s × 50 s Distance = 1416.666... m (approximately) This distance is the combined length of the train and the platform.

The task is to find the maximum number of blue points that can lie on a segment with endpoints at red points, not containing other red points. 1. Let's analyze the given conditions. If we have a segment with endpoints at red points and containing another red point inside, the condition states that there must be at least 3 blue points within that segment.

We will connect pairs of neighboring numbers with arrows in such a way that the arrow points from the multiple (the number which is divisible) to the divisor (if the neighboring numbers are equal, then the direction of the arrow is chosen arbitrarily). 2. There are 7 arrows because there are 7 pairs of neighboring numbers in a circle. Since 7 is an odd number, we cannot have a strictly alternating sequence of arrows pointing in opposite directions. 3. Therefore, there must be two consecutive arrows that are pointing in the same direction. Let's denote these numbers as (x rightarrow y rightarrow z). - This means that (x) is divisible by (y), and (y) is divisible by (z). 4. From the transitive property of divisibility, since (x) is divisible by (y) and (y) is divisible by (z), it follows that (x) is divisible by (z). 5.

Since the ratio of water to detergent is 200 : 25, we can set up a proportion to find out how many liters of detergent there will be: Water (200 parts) : Detergent (25 parts) = 300 liters : x liters Now we can solve for x (the amount of detergent): 200/25 = 300/x 200x = 25 * 300 200x = 7500 x = 7500 / 200 x = 37.5 So, the altered solution will contain boxed{37.5} liters of detergent."},{"prompt":"List all convex quadrilaterals in which the sums of the sines of opposite angles are equal.","completion":"1. Consider a quadrilateral (ABCD) with vertices (A), (B), (C), (D) as shown in the figure. Draw the diagonal (BD) to divide the quadrilateral into two triangles (ABD) and (BCD). 2. Introduce the following notation for the angles: - ( angle ABD = a ) - ( angle CBD = b ) - ( angle ADB = g ) - ( angle CDB = d ) 3. Then, the angles at vertices (A) and (C) opposite to the diagonal (BD) are: - ( angle BAD = 180^circ - (a + g) ) - ( angle BCD = 180^circ - (b + d) ) 4. According to the problem, the sums of the sines of opposite angles are equal: [ sin(a + g) + sin(b + d) = sin(a + b) + sin(g + d) ] 5. Using the sine addition formula, we can express these sums as products: [ sin(a + g) = 2 sinleft(frac{a+g}{2}right) cosleft(frac{a-g}{2}right) ] [ sin(b + d) = 2 sinleft(frac{b+d}{2}right) cosleft(frac{b-d}{2}right) ] [ sin(a + b) = 2 sinleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) cosleft(frac{a-b}{2}right) ] [ sin(g + d) = 2 sinleft(frac{g+d}{2}right) cosleft(frac{g-d}{2}right) ] 6.

Simplifying and factoring out the common factor, we get: [ sinleft(frac{a+g}{2}right) cosleft(frac{a-g}{2}right) + sinleft(frac{b+d}{2}right) cosleft(frac{b-d}{2}right) = sinleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) cosleft(frac{a-b}{2}right) + sinleft(frac{g+d}{2}right) cosleft(frac{g-d}{2}right) ] 8. By simplifying using trigonometric identities, we arrive at: [ cosleft(frac{a-g}{2}right) left( sinleft(frac{a+g}{2}right) - sinleft(frac{g+d}{2}right) right) = cosleft(frac{a-b}{2}right) left( sinleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) - sinleft(frac{b+d}{2}right) right) ] 9. Since cosine is generally non-zero, this simplifies further to: [ sinleft(frac{a+g}{2}right) - sinleft(frac{g+d}{2}right) = sinleft(frac{a+b}{2}right) - sinleft(frac{b+d}{2}right) ] 10. Solving this equation reveals that at least two opposite angles must be equal or the quadrilateral must satisfy certain symmetry. This implies that two opposite sides are parallel, thus identifying the quadrilateral as a parallelogram. 11.

Setting a = 1 to find x: [ 1^2(1-5x) + 1(1-6x) - x - frac{7}{3} = 0 implies -10x - frac{7}{3} = 0 implies x = -frac{1}{36}. ] 6. **Verify Nonnegativity**: Substitute x = -frac{1}{36} back into the factorization: [ (a-1)^2left(frac{41}{36}a + frac{83}{36}right) geq 0. ] This expression is clearly nonnegative for all a > 0 since both squared terms and the linear expression in a are nonnegative. 7. **Conclusion**: Since the inequality holds for any positive a, b, and c, by cyclically summing, we have: [ frac{a^3 + 3b^3}{5a + b} + frac{b^3 + 3c^3}{5b + c} + frac{c^3 + 3a^3}{5c + a} ge frac{2}{3} (a^2 + b^2 + c^2). ] Thus, the original inequality is proven. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Two fair 6sided dice are rolled.

Therefore: [ frac{KC_1}{C_1C_2} = frac{BD}{AB} ] 6. **Identify the half segment**: Since: [ C_1C_2 = C_1D + C_2D = frac{1}{2}AD + frac{1}{2}BD = frac{1}{2}AB ] Hence: [ KC_1 = frac{1}{2}BD ] 7. **Sum of segments**: Therefore: [ AK = AC_1 + KC_1 = frac{1}{2}AD + frac{1}{2}BD = frac{1}{2}AB ] 8. **Conclusion**: Hence, (CZ) indeed forms the median segment of (triangle ABC). The ratio: [ frac{CZ}{ZK} = frac{CM_1}{M_1C_1} = 2 ] shows: [ CZ : ZK = 2 : 1 ] Since the ratio 2:1 confirms that (Z) lies on the median (CK) and splits it in this ratio, it indicates that (Z) is none other than the centroid of (triangle ABC). Thus, we conclude that the centroid (Z) lies on the median (CK) and divides it in a 2:1 ratio from the vertex. Therefore, (Z) is exactly the point of intersection of the medians, confirming that it coincides with the centroid (center of gravity) of the triangle (ABC).

These numbers are grouped in sets of 5, so for each group: - Numbers 1, 2 round down to 0, numbers 3, 4, 5 round up to 5. Thus, instead of summing 1 to 5 (15), Sarah sums 0+0+5+5+5=15. - Similarly, 6, 7, 8, 9 round to 5, and 10 rounds to 10. So instead of summing 6 to 10 (40), Sarah sums 5+5+5+5+10=30. - Decide on her new sums by applying this grouping method up to 60. Calculating for larger groups, the sum adjustment: - For each repeating set of 1, 1, 3 that are set to multiples of 5, the pattern continues till 60. - Hence, groups of 1 to 5, 6 to 10, ..., 56 to 60. The sum for Sarah can be simplified: - 12 sets of 5, each originally summing to 15, don't change (12 times 15 = 180). - 12 sets of 15, each losing 10 (40-30) summing (180 - 12 times 10 = 60), so sums 180 + 60 = 240. Thus, Sarah's total sum can be represented as 30 times 12 = 360 and 300 times 4 = 1200, leading to 1560.

Next, let ( y_0 ) be such that ( f(y_0) = 1 ). - Substituting ( y = y_0 ) into property (1), we get: [ f(x f(y_0)) = y_0 f(x) ] Since ( f(y_0) = 1 ): [ f(x) = y_0 f(x) ] This implies ( y_0 = 1 ).

Thus, ( f(a) = a ). 4. If ( a > 1 ): - Then we have: [ f(a^2) = f(a cdot f(a)) = a f(a) = a^2 ] - Using induction and the property of ( f ), it is easy to see: [ f(a^{2^n}) = a^{2^n} rightarrow +infty quad text{as} quad n rightarrow infty ] - This contradicts property (2) that ( lim_{x to infty} f(x) = 0 ). 5.

Denote the center of mass of the flies by ( O ). Let's assume, for a moment, that one of the flies is located at vertex ( A ) of ( Delta ABC ). 2. Let ( A_1 ) represent the center of mass of the other two flies, both having equal mass. Thus, ( A_1 ) lies on the line segment joining vertices ( B ) and ( C ) on the side of ( Delta ABC ). 3. By definition, ( A_1 ) divides the segment ( BC ) equally because the flies have the same mass, making it the midpoint of ( BC ). 4. Given that ( O ) is the center of mass of all three flies, it lies on the line segment ( A A_1 ) and divides it in the ratio ( 2:1 ). Specifically, ( AO : OA_1 = 2:1 ). This follows from the properties of centroids in a triangle where the centroid cuts each median into a ratio of ( 2:1 ). 5. Similarly, if we start by assuming the fly exists at vertex ( B ), then a parallel analysis shows that ( O ) will divide the segment connecting ( B ) to the midpoint of ( AC ) in the ratio of ( 2:1 ). 6. Again, if the fly is considered at vertex ( C ), ( O ) will divide ( C ) to the midpoint of ( AB ) in a ( 2:1 ) ratio. 7.

Starting with the given equation rho=sin theta, we substitute rho with sqrt{x^2 + y^2} and sin theta with frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}, since sin theta = frac{y}{rho}: sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = frac{y}{sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} Square both sides of the equation to remove the square root: x^2 + y^2 = frac{y^2}{x^2 + y^2} Multiplying both sides by x^2 + y^2 to eliminate the denominator on the right side, we get: (x^2 + y^2)^2 = y^2 Expand the left side and simplify: x^4 + 2x^2y^2 + y^4 - y^2 = 0 Since x^4 and 2x^2y^2 are always non-negative, the above expression can be further simplified by focusing on the terms y^4-y^2. However, we recognize that obtaining x^4 in the equation is not correct as it came from the squaring. We need to revisit the transformation process.

Part 1: Sum of the Plane Angles 1. Consider a trihedral angle with vertex S and edges emanating to points A, B, and C. 2. Lay off equal segments SA, SB, and SC on the edges from S to each vertex. 3. Let O be the orthogonal projection of the point S onto the plane ABC. 4. Triangles ASA, OSB, and OSC are all isosceles triangles; thus, they share the same base AB, BC, and CA, respectively. 5. Since SA > SO, SB > SO, and SC > SO, we can compare the corresponding angles: - angle ASB < angle AOB - angle BSC < angle BOC - angle CSA < angle COA 6. By adding these inequalities: angle ASB + angle BSC + angle CSA < angle AOB + angle BOC + angle COA 7. It is known that [ angle AOB + angle BOC + angle COA = 2pi, ] when O lies within the triangle ABC. Otherwise, the sum will be strictly less than 2pi. 8.

If we also set k=0, the line equation becomes y=2, which clearly does not intersect with y=0. This indicates that a=0 does not satisfy the condition of the problem since the lines do not intersect. **Case 2: a=1** Setting a=1 gives us the quadratic function y=x^{2}-2x-3.

Let alpha_1 alpha_2 alpha_3 alpha_4 be the last four digits of the sequence. Here, each alpha_i (for i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is either 0 or 1. 2. Consider what happens if we try to extend the sequence by appending either 0 or 1 at the end. 3. If appending a 0 at the end does not lead to duplication of any of the subsequences of five consecutive digits, then such an extension would be valid. This means there would be no subsequence in the original sequence of the form alpha_1 alpha_2 alpha_3 alpha_4 0. 4. Similarly, if appending a 1 at the end does not lead to duplication, it implies that there is no subsequence of the form alpha_1 alpha_2 alpha_3 alpha_4 1 within the current sequence. 5. Given that neither appending a 0 nor a 1 at the end is possible without creating a duplicate subsequence, there must already exist subsequences alpha_1 alpha_2 alpha_3 alpha_4 0 and alpha_1 alpha_2 alpha_3 alpha_4 1 within the original sequence. Thus, the subsequence formed by these last four digits must have occurred with different predecessors (0 and 1). 6. Since we are given the constraint that the sequence is maximal with no repetitions of any five-digit subsequences, the subsequence alpha_1 alpha_2 alpha_3 alpha_4 must appear exactly twice within the sequence: - Once followed by a 0. - Once followed by a 1. 7. Analyzing further, we deduce that the only way alpha_1 alpha_2 alpha_3 alpha_4 can appear twice with both preceding 0 and 1 without repetition is if it constitutes the boundary condition appearing both at the beginning and the end of the sequence. 8. Therefore, we conclude that the first four digits of the sequence must indeed coincide with the last four digits; otherwise, the constraints on the sequence would not hold true.

Hence, A_1 and B_1 are the centers of these latitude circles. 5. **Use Triangle Symmetries:** - Consider the right-angled isosceles triangle AOB. The midpoint C of AB is also the center of the circumcircle of triangle AOB which includes O as a midpoint between A and B. - By rotating A by 90^circ around C, A maps to O and similarly, B maps to O. 6. **Geometric Relations between Radii:** - When A is rotated to O and vice versa, A_1 moves to B_1, establishing that OA_1 = A_1B = OB_1 = B_1A. Therefore, the statement regarding the circle's planes is proven by establishing parallel and perpendicular relationships. 7. **Sums of Distances:** - From the established relation, the distance A_1B_1 is the sum of A_1O and OB_1, which translates geometrically to A_{1}O + OB_1 lying in the planes containing A_1 and B_1. 8. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the distance between the planes of the two latitude circles is equal to the sum of the radii of these circles.

Hence, by the SSS theorem: [ triangle MAD cong triangle MAB ] 2. **Determining Angle ( angle BAM ):** Since ( triangle MAD ) is congruent to ( triangle MAB ), the angles at ( A ) are also equal: [ angle BAM = angle MAD ] Each of these angles is half of a right angle because (AB) and (AD) are perpendicular sides of the square.

However, since our number specifically ends in 5, this narrows down our options. 2. **Square of a number ending in 5:** - If a number is a perfect square and ends in 5, then its square root must end in 5. This is because: [ (10n + 5)^2 = 100n^2 + 100n + 25 ] - Notice that the result always ends in 25. 3. **Resulting property when ending in 25:** - Let's examine the expression ( (10n + 5)^2 ): [ (10n + 5)^2 = 100n^2 + 100n + 25 ] - Here, the last two digits are 25.

Prove that the polynomial ( P(x) ) is linear.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Conditions**: Let's consider a non-constant polynomial ( P(x) ) with integer coefficients and a natural number ( n ). We define a sequence ( {a_k} ) with ( a_0 = n ), and ( a_{k} = P(a_{k-1}) ) for all natural ( k ). We are given that for any natural ( b ), there exists an element in the sequence ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots ), which is a ( b )-th power of a natural number greater than 1. 2. **Initial Observation**: Notice that for every natural ( b ) in the sequence ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots ), there will be infinitely many ( b )-th powers of natural numbers greater than 1. Indeed, if the quantity of such numbers is finite, and the greatest of them is ( N = x^b ), then the sequence will not encounter any ( N b )-th power, which is impossible. 3. **Difference and Modular Argument**: Let us denote ( d_k = a_{k+1} - a_k ). Then, [ a_{k+1} equiv a_k pmod{d_k} ] Since all coefficients of ( P ) are integers, from ( a equiv a' pmod{d_k} ), it follows that [ P(a) equiv P(a') pmod{d_k} ] From this, by straightforward induction on ( s ), we have: [ a_{k+s+1} equiv a_{k+s} pmod{d_k} ] implying ( a_{k+s} equiv a_k pmod{d_k} ) for all ( s geq 0 ). 4. **Lemma Setup**: We assert that ( a_k(a_k - 1) ) is divisible by ( d_k ). 5. **Proof of Lemma**: Let ( p^ell ) be the maximum power of a prime ( p ) dividing ( d_k ). We need to show that ( a_k(a_k - 1) ) is divisible by ( p^ell ). Set ( b = p^{ell - 1}(p - 1)ell ). According to the above observation, there exists an index ( s > k ) such that ( a_s = m^b ) for some natural ( m ). Then, [ a_s equiv a_k pmod{p^ell} ] - If ( m ) is not divisible by ( p ), by Euler's theorem we get: [ a_s = (m^{p^{ell-1}(p-1)})^ell equiv 1^ell equiv 1 pmod{p^ell} ] implying ( a_k equiv 1 pmod{p^ell} ). - If ( m ) is divisible by ( p ), then ( a_s ) is divisible by ( p^ell ) and so is ( a_k ). Thus, ( a_k(a_k - 1) ) is divisible by ( p^ell ), confirming the lemma. 6. **Exploiting the Lemma**: According to the lemma, for any ( k ) the number ( a_k(a_k - 1) ) is divisible by ( d_k = P(a_k) - a_k ). Since there's an infinite set of distinct integers ( a_k ), we have: [ |x(x - 1)| geq |Q(x)| ] for infinite integer ( x ), where ( Q(x) = P(x) - x ). 7. **Considering Polynomial Degree**: Suppose the degree of the polynomial ( P(x) ) is greater than 1. Then the above inequality for infinite integer ( x ) can only hold if ( Q(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial with the leading coefficient ( pm 1 ). Hence, [ Q(x) = pm x^2 + ux + v ] In this case, the values of the polynomial, [ Q(x) mp x(x - 1) = (u pm 1)x + v ] should be divisible by ( Q(x) ) for an infinite set of integers ( x ).

In triangle geometry, known properties state that the line through the feet of the altitudes (i.e., the orthic axis) is perpendicular to the line joining the orthocenter and the circumcenter of the triangle. 5. Since point ( A ) is involved, we can look at another geometric property relating to the circumcenter ( O ). The line ( B_1C_1 ) is indeed perpendicular to ( OA ), as they are a pair of orthogonal axes related through the properties of the altitudes and circumcenter in the triangle. 6.

The probability of drawing the first slip with an odd number is 5/10, since there are 5 odd slips out of a total of 10. After drawing one odd slip, there are now 4 odd slips left and a total of 9 slips remaining. So the probability of drawing a second slip with an odd number is 4/9. Similarly, the probability of drawing a third slip with an odd number, after having drawn two odd slips, is 3/8, since there are now 3 odd slips left out of the remaining 8 slips. Finally, the probability of drawing a fourth slip with an odd number, after having drawn three odd slips, is 2/7, since there are now 2 odd slips left out of the remaining 7 slips. To find the overall probability of drawing 4 slips with odd numbers, we multiply the probabilities of each individual draw: P(4 odd slips) = (5/10) * (4/9) * (3/8) * (2/7) Now, let's calculate this: P(4 odd slips) = (5/10) * (4/9) * (3/8) * (2/7) = (5 * 4 * 3 * 2) / (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) = (120) / (5040) = 1 / (5040/120) = 1 / 42 So the probability of drawing 4 slips with odd numbers on them without replacement is boxed{1/42} ."},{"prompt":"Every card in a deck displays one of three symbols star, circle, or square, each filled with one of three colors red, yellow, or blue, and each color is shaded in one of three intensities light, normal, or dark.

Prove that if no three segments intersect at a single point, then there are at least (n) intersections of red segments with blue segments.","completion":": To prove that if no three segments intersect at a single point, then there will be at least n points of intersection between the red and blue segments, we will proceed in a structured manner to make the logic clearer. **Step 1**: Consider the setup as described in the problem. We have a circle with (4n) points marked on it, colored alternately red and blue. Each segment connects points of the same color. **Step 2**: Observing intersections and modifications. Suppose we have two red segments, say (A C) and (B D), that intersect. It can be observed that any line intersecting (A C) and (B D) will at most intersect twice with both segments. However, if we replace (A C) and (B D) with segments (A B) and (C D), then the number of intersections with these new segments would remain constant or decrease. This is due to the fact that the point of intersection between (A C) and (B D) would be eliminated. **Step 3**: Conduct iterative modifications. We repeat the operation of replacing intersecting red segments with non-intersecting alternatives until all the red segments become non-intersecting. We now need to prove that in this state, the number of points where red segments intersect with blue segments is at least (n). **Step 4**: Analyzing the intersections between non-intersecting red segments and blue segments. Let's consider any red segment. Since there are (2n) red segments, after all modifications, each red segment will have (2n-1) points of the opposite color on either side. We also know that each side will have an odd number of points of the opposite color, since every alternate point is colored differently. For a red segment, if we check the segments made by blue points: - There must be at least one blue segment that intersects any given red segment. To see this, note that the points opposite any red segment must include at least (n) blue segments because: 1. There are (2n) total blue segments. 2. These segments are evenly distributed around the circle. **Step 5**: Conclusion from our analysis. Since each red segment must intersect with at least one blue segment, and we have (2n) red segments, by Pigeonhole Principle, the number of distinct red-blue intersections is at least (n).

This implies that for every (k), the numbers (a_k) and (S - a_k) end in the same digit.

Let ( N = 1984 = 2^6 cdot 31 ). We need to prove that the sum of the squares of 1984 consecutive positive integers cannot be the square of an integer. 2. Consider the sum of the squares of ( N ) consecutive integers starting from ( a+1 ) to ( a+N ): [ sum_{k=1}^N (a+k)^2 = sum_{k=1}^N (a^2 + 2ak + k^2) ] This can be expanded as: [ sum_{k=1}^N (a^2 + 2ak + k^2) = N a^2 + 2a sum_{k=1}^N k + sum_{k=1}^N k^2 ] 3. Using the formulas for the sum of the first ( N ) natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ( N ) natural numbers: [ sum_{k=1}^N k = frac{N(N+1)}{2} ] [ sum_{k=1}^N k^2 = frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} ] 4. Substituting these into the sum: [ N a^2 + 2a cdot frac{N(N+1)}{2} + frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} ] Simplifying, we get: [ N a^2 + N(N+1)a + frac{N(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} ] Factoring out ( N ): [ N left( a^2 + (N+1)a + frac{(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} right) ] 5. We need to check if this expression can be a perfect square. Consider the expression inside the parentheses modulo ( N ): [ a^2 + (N+1)a + frac{(N+1)(2N+1)}{6} pmod{N} ] Since ( N = 1984 = 2^6 cdot 31 ), we have: [ 6a^2 + 6(N+1)a + (N+1)(2N+1) equiv 6a^2 + 6a + 1 pmod{31} ] 6. For the sum to be a perfect square, we need: [ 6a^2 + 6a + 1 equiv 0 pmod{31} ] This implies: [ 6(2a+1)^2 equiv 2 pmod{31} ] Hence: [ (6a+3)^2 equiv 3 pmod{31} ] 7. Using the Legendre symbol, we check if 3 is a quadratic residue modulo 31: [ left( frac{3}{31} right) = left( frac{31}{3} right) (-1)^{frac{3-1}{2} cdot frac{31-1}{2}} = -1 ] Since ( left( frac{3}{31} right) = -1 ), 3 is not a quadratic residue modulo 31, making it impossible for ( (6a+3)^2 equiv 3 pmod{31} ) to hold. 8. Additionally, considering the powers of 2, since ( 1984/6 = 2^5 cdot 31/3 ) and ( 6a^2 + 6a + 1 equiv 1 pmod{2} ), the power of 2 dividing the sum of squares is ( 2^5 ). Therefore, the sum cannot be a perfect square. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Andi and Bori divided the 81 cards from the SET game between themselves; Andi got 40 cards and Bori got 41 cards. They each count how many sets of three cards among the ones they have form a SET. What is the sum of the numbers they obtained?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** - The SET card game consists of 81 cards. - Andi has 40 cards, and Bori has 41 cards. - A SET is a combination of three cards that fulfill certain conditions. - We need to determine the total number of SETs formed from the given distribution of cards between Andi and Bori. 2. **Counting the Total Sets:** - First, observe that the total number of ways to choose 3 cards out of 81 can be calculated using the binomial coefficient: [ binom{81}{3} = frac{81 times 80 times 79}{3 times 2 times 1} = 85320 ] 3. **Counting Sets Within Andi's and Bori's Hands:** - We need to count the sets formed with only Andi's 40 cards: [ text{Number of sets within Andi's cards} = binom{40}{3} = frac{40 times 39 times 38}{3 times 2 times 1} = 9880 ] - Similarly, for Bori's 41 cards: [ text{Number of sets within Bori's cards} = binom{41}{3} = frac{41 times 40 times 39}{3 times 2 times 1} = 10660 ] 4. **Counting Sets Across Andi's and Bori's Hands:** - Since we counted sets only within each hand separately, it is crucial to count the sets where cards are taken from both Andi's and Bori's hands. - Number of sets using 2 cards from one hand and 1 from the other can be calculated, but to directly count the total sets accurately, note that: [ text{Total sets} = binom{81}{3} = 85320 ] 5. **Adding Set Counts for an Accurate Total:** - The initial issue simplifies to understanding the interactions beyond exclusively Andi's and Bori's combinations: - Sets are formed from the combined 81 cards with nothing left. 6. **Conclusion:** - The total number of sets remains as the sum within and across both hands however, considering multiple group combinations correctly. - In essence, theoretical calculation might slightly vary under special constraints, yet overall theoretical perspective offers accurate results.

Hence, 47 appears in the 47th row of Pascal's Triangle, since binom{47}{1} = 47. In any row n where n < 47, the factorial n! does not contain the factor 47, so binom{n}{k} cannot be 47 for any k because 47 cannot divide n!. For rows where n > 47, the elements of Pascal's Triangle are either 1 or greater than 47 except for those cases where specific properties of binomial coefficients might allow smaller numbers. However, since 47 is prime, it does not appear as a binomial coefficient in rows greater than 47 for k neq 1 or k neq n-1. Thus, 47 appears only in the 47th row.

This is a known result for the expectation of a geometrically distributed random variable. 2. **Adjusting for Y starting from k=2:** When we consider P(Y=k)=P(1-P)^{k-1} for k=2,3,cdots, we need to adjust the expectation formula by subtracting the probability of Y=1. This gives us E(Y)=frac{1}{P}-1times P(Y=1)=frac{1}{P}-1times P(1-P)^{0}=frac{1}{P}-1. 3. **Introducing variable t for simplification:** Let t=1-P, then P=1-t.

She also found a fifth of what she needed in her supplies, so she found (1/5)T. The total amount of rhinestones she has is the sum of what she bought and what she found: (1/3)T + (1/5)T To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which would be 15 in this case. So we convert the fractions: (5/15)T + (3/15)T = (8/15)T This means that Andrea has 8/15 of the total number of rhinestones she needs. We are told that she still needs 21 rhinestones to complete her project, which represents the remaining part of the total. Since she has 8/15 of the total, the remaining part she needs is 7/15 of the total (because 15/15 would be the whole, and 15/15 - 8/15 = 7/15). So, 7/15 of the total number of rhinestones is equal to 21: (7/15)T = 21 To find T, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 7/15, which is 15/7: T = 21 * (15/7) T = 21 * 15 / 7 T = 315 / 7 T = 45 Therefore, Andrea needs a total of boxed{45} rhinestones for her art project."},{"prompt":"f the consecutive integers from 30 to 1 were written as 3029282726..., what would be the 39^{text{th}} digit to be written?","completion":"1. **Calculate total digits from two-digit numbers**: Numbers 30 to 10 contribute digits.

Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of motorbike Relative speed = 100 kmph - 64 kmph Relative speed = 36 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s Relative speed in m/s = 36 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 36 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 36 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in m/s = 10 m/s The train needs to cover a distance equal to its own length to completely overtake the motorbike.

Suppose a and b are two distinct positive integers. The problem requires proving there exists a rectangle with side lengths a and b such that its vertices have the same color. 2. **Opposite Color Assumption**: - If S_{n} and S_{n+a} have the same color for some integer n, we can choose the rectangle with vertices (n, 0) in S_{n}, (n, b) in S_{n}, (n+a, 0) in S_{n+a}, and (n+a, b) in S_{n+a}. This would complete the proof. - Assume S_{n} and S_{n+a} have opposite colors for each n. - Similarly, assume S_{n} and S_{n+b} have opposite colors. 3. **Induction Argument**: - Using induction on |p| + |q|, we can argue that for arbitrary integers p and q, strips S_{n} and S_{n + pa + qb}: - Have the same color if p + q is even. - Have opposite colors if p + q is odd. 4. **Greatest Common Divisor**: - Let d = operatorname{gcd}(a, b). Define a_1 = frac{a}{d} and b_1 = frac{b}{d}. - Consider p = b_1 and q = -a_1. The strips S_0 and S_{b_1 a - a_1 b} are identical, hence they have the same color. This implies a_1 + b_1 is even. - Since a_1 and b_1 are coprime, this result is only viable if both a_1 and b_1 are odd. 5. **Relative Sizes**: - Without loss of generality, assume a > b. Thus, a_1 > b_1 geq 1, implying a_1 geq 3. 6. **Linear Combination**: - Choose integers k and ell such that k a_1 - ell b_1 = 1. Hence, k a - ell b = d. - Since a_1 and b_1 are odd, k + ell is odd as well. For every integer n, strips S_n and S_{n + ka - ell b} = S_{n + d} have opposite colors. - Therefore, the coloring is periodic with a period 2d, i.e., the strips S_n and S_{n + 2d} have the same color for every n. 7. **Construction of Rectangle**: - Construct the desired rectangle ABCD with AB = CD = a and BC = AD = b ensuring vertex A lies on the x-axis with AB having a projection of length 2d on the x-axis. - This is feasible since a = a_1 d > 2d. - The coordinates of the vertices will then be: [ begin{cases} A = (t, 0) B = (t + 2d, y_1) C = (u + 2d, y_2) D = (u, y_3) end{cases} ] 8. **Y-coordinate Calculation**: - Let varphi = sqrt{a_1^2 - 4} (derived from the Pythagorean theorem). - y_1 = BB_0 = sqrt{a^2 - 4d^2} = d sqrt{a_1^2 - 4} = d varphi. 9. **Periodic Color Matching**: - Given the value of varphi is irrational, this crucially means points A and B, as well as C and D, can be guaranteed to follow the periodic color distribution. - Consequently, variables t and u need to be suitably chosen such that vertices A and D fall within strips of the same color. 10. **Maximal Sequence**: - Let w be the largest integer such that w consecutive strips S_{n_0}, S_{n_0 + 1}, ldots, S_{n_0 + w - 1} share the same color. - Choose t from interval (n_0, n_0 + w). Consider interval I = (n_0 + frac{bd}{a}varphi, n_0 + frac{bd}{a}varphi + w). - Since I must intersect w + 1 consecutive strips due to its length and irrational endpoints, it will necessarily contain points of both colors. 11. **Final Choice**: - Choose u in I such that the line x = u is red and set t = u - frac{bd}{a} varphi. This configuration ensures (t, 0) and (u, y_3) both lie within red strips.

The segment ( OC ) intersects circle ( odot O ) with diameter ( AB ) at point ( D ). The ray ( BD ) intersects ( AC ) at point ( E ). If ( AE = CD ), prove that ( angle BAC = 90^circ ).","completion":"1. We are given an isosceles triangle triangle ABC with AB = AC. Let O be the midpoint of AB. The line segment OC intersects the circle odot O (centered at O with radius OA, which is the same length as OB) at point D. Line BD intersects AC at point E. We know that AE = CD. We need to prove that angle BAC = 90^circ. 2. First, note that since O is the midpoint of AB and AB = AC, the circle odot O has radius OA = OB. Thus, O is not only the center of the circle odot O, but also lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. 3. Connecting AD, since D lies on the circle odot O with O as the center, triangle AOD becomes a right triangle with angle ADB = 90^circ due to the property of the semicircle (the angle subtended by a semicircle is a right angle). 4. Applying Menelaus' theorem to triangle OAC with the transversal BDE: [ frac{CD}{DO} cdot frac{OB}{BA} cdot frac{AE}{EC} = 1 ] Given CD = AE and OB = DO, we can substitute these into the equation: [ frac{AE}{DO} cdot frac{DO}{BA} cdot frac{AE}{EC} = 1 ] Simplifying this, since OB = DO and AE = CD: [ frac{AE cdot AE}{BA cdot EC} = 1 ] Hence: [ AE^2 = BA cdot EC ] 5. Next, using AE = CD, exploit the property of similar triangles: [ frac{CD}{CE} = frac{CA}{CD} Rightarrow CD^2 = CE cdot CA ] 6. Thus, we have triangle CDE sim triangle CAD because angle DCE = angle ACD due to vertical angles and they share angle C. 7. Therefore, corresponding angles of these similar triangles gives us: [ angle CAD = angle CDE ] This transposes as: [ angle ODB = angle ABD Rightarrow angle BAD = angle DCE ] 8. Hence, we conclude: [ angle BAC = angle BAD + angle CAD = angle BAD + angle ABD ] 9.

From the circle's equation C: (x-1)^{2}+y^{2}=4, we identify the center C(1,0) and radius r=2. 2. Knowing the area of triangle ABC is frac{8}{5}, we use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two radii and a chord on a circle: S_{triangle ABC}=frac{1}{2}times 2times 2times sin angle ACB=frac{8}{5}. 3. Solving for sin angle ACB, we find sin angle ACB=frac{4}{5}. 4. Letting frac{1}{2}angle ACB=theta, we have 2sin theta cos theta =frac{4}{5}. 5. This simplifies to frac{2tantheta}{tan^{2}theta+1}=frac{4}{5}, leading to tan theta =frac{1}{2} or tan theta =2. 6. Therefore, cos theta =frac{2}{sqrt{5}} or cos theta =frac{1}{sqrt{5}}. 7. The distance d from the center to the line x-my+1=0 is either d=frac{4}{sqrt{5}} or d=frac{2}{sqrt{5}}. 8. Solving frac{2}{sqrt{1+m^{2}}}=frac{4}{sqrt{5}} or frac{2}{sqrt{1+m^{2}}}=frac{2}{sqrt{5}}, we find m=pm frac{1}{2} or m=pm 2. **Second Approach:** 1. With the radius of circle C being 2 and center C(1,0), we let the distance from center C to the line x-my+1=0 be d. 2. The chord length |AB|=2sqrt{4-d^{2}}, so S_{triangle ABC}=frac{1}{2}times 2sqrt{4-d^{2}}times d=frac{8}{5}. 3. Solving for d^{2}, we get d^{2}=frac{4}{5} or d^{2}=frac{16}{5}, leading to d=frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} or d=frac{4sqrt{5}}{5}. 4. Using the distance formula from a point to a line, when d=frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, we get frac{2}{sqrt{m^{2}+1}}=frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, resulting in m=pm 2. 5. When d=frac{4sqrt{5}}{5}, the distance formula yields frac{2}{sqrt{m^{2}+1}}=frac{4sqrt{5}}{5}, leading to m=pm frac{1}{2}. In conclusion, the possible values of m are pm 2 or pm frac{1}{2}.

First, using the characteristic equation approach for linear homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients, we solve for (x_n). 3. The characteristic equation for ( x_n ) is given by: [ t^2 - 4t + 1 = 0. ] 4. Solving the quadratic equation above: [ t = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{12}}{2} = 2 pm sqrt{3}. ] 5.

Hence, [ x_n = frac{sqrt{3}}{6} (2 + sqrt{3})^n - frac{sqrt{3}}{6} (2 - sqrt{3})^n. ] 9. Similarly, solving the characteristic equation for ( y_n ), which is the same: [ t^2 - 4t + 1 = 0 implies t = 2 pm sqrt{3}. ] Therefore, the general solution for ( y_n ) is: [ y_n = C (2 + sqrt{3})^n + D (2 - sqrt{3})^n. ] 10. Using the initial conditions, ( y_0 = 1 ) and ( y_1 = 2 ), we form: [ C + D = 1 quad text{(from } y_0 = 1 text{)}, ] [ C (2 + sqrt{3}) + D (2 - sqrt{3}) = 2 quad text{(from } y_1 = 2 text{)}. ] 11.

Hence ( D = 1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{2} ). 11. So, blocking{ [ y_n = frac{(2 + sqrt{3})^n}{2} + frac{(2 - sqrt{3})^n}{2}. } ] 12. Now, we check the relationship for ( y_n^2 ) and ( x_n^2 ): blocking{ [ x_n^2 = left( frac{sqrt{3}}{6}(2 + sqrt{3})^n - frac{sqrt{3}}{6}(2 - sqrt{3})^n right)^2, ]}] ] and [ y_n^2 = left( frac{1}{2}(2 + sqrt{3})^n + frac{1}{2}(2 - sqrt{3})^n right)^2. ] 13.
