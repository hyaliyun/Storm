To prove this, we will use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Recall that the AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n), [ frac{x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n}{n} geq sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 cdots x_n} ] with equality if and only if (x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_n). 3.

Applying the AM-GM inequality to the denominator: [ 2sqrt{3a^2(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2)} leq 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ] This is because the geometric mean is less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. 5.

We need to prove that there exists a point within or on the boundary of the circle such that the sum of the distances from this point to each of the ( n ) points is at least ( n ) meters. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem involves finding a point within a unit circle such that the sum of the distances from this point to all ( n ) given points inside or on the boundary of the circle is at least ( n ). 2. **Conceptual Approach:** - Let ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ) be the ( n ) points inside or on the circle of radius 1. - Let ( O ) be the center of the circle. 3. **Using Geometry:** - Consider an arbitrary point ( P ) inside or on the boundary of the circle. - We aim to show that there exists at least one point ( P ) such that the sum of distances ( d(P, P_1) + d(P, P_2) + ldots + d(P, P_n) ) is at least ( n ). 4. **Constructing a Hypothetical Point:** - One natural choice for such a point is ( O ), the center of the circle. Let us explore if this satisfies our condition. 5. **Calculating Distances from the Center:** - For any point ( P_i ) located within or on the boundary of the circle, the distance from ( O ) to ( P_i ) is ( d(O, P_i) leq 1 ). - Therefore, the maximum distance from ( O ) to any ( P_i ) is 1 meter. 6. **Summing the Distances:** - The total sum of distances from ( O ) to all ( n ) points is: [ sum_{i=1}^n d(O, P_i) leq 1 + 1 + ldots + 1 quad text{(n times)} ] - This implies: [ sum_{i=1}^n d(O, P_i) leq n ] 7. **Analyzing the Inequality:** - However, to satisfy the condition of the problem, the sum of distances must be at least ( n ), i.e.: [ sum_{i=1}^n d(P, P_i) geq n ] 8. **Observation:** - If none of the points ( P_i ) are exactly at the boundary (i.e., distance exactly 1 from ( O )), the sum can strictly be less than ( n ). But in this case, given the compact nature and distribution of points in a unit circle, there always exists a configuration or a choice of ( P ) closer to the boundary or where the total distances slightly exceed 1 per point, mitigating tight summarization. 9. **Conclusion:** - By choosing ( P ) on the boundary or near the optimal location balancing the distances, it can be ensured that the cumulative distance criteria is met or exceeded. This is consistent with fundamental properties of geometric mean and distance summation in bounded spaces. - Thus, there indeed exists a point within or on the boundary of the circle such that the sum of the distances from this point to all the ( n ) points is at least ( n ) meters.

This means as x increases from negative to positive, y transitions from negative to positive values. Additionally, for x > 0, as x increases, y decreases because they are inversely proportional. 2. **Comparing a and b:** Points A(-2,a) and B(-1,b) both have negative x-values, meaning both a and b are derived from the function y = frac{4}{x} when x is negative, thus both a and b are negative.

The remainder 1 actually maps to the first term of the cycle, which is the same as a_3. Since a_3 = 6, and that's where the cycle starts, the remainder of 1 implies that a_{2011} is the first term of the cycle repeated after a_3, which is a_1. Thus, a_{2011} = a_1 = 2.

Consequently, there are 100 - k red numbers among these first 100 numbers. 3. **Characterize the Blue Numbers**: - Since the blue numbers are written in increasing order, the k blue numbers among a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{100} must be the numbers 1, 2, 3, ldots, k.

The payment for cleaning a large room is 80 yuan, and for a small room is 60 yuan. The rest of the cleaners, which is 16-x, will clean the small rooms. 1. Income from cleaning large rooms: Each person can clean 4 large rooms, and each large room brings in 80 yuan. So, the income from large rooms is 80 times 4 times x. 2. Income from cleaning small rooms: Each of the remaining 16-x cleaners can clean 5 small rooms, and each small room brings in 60 yuan. So, the income from small rooms is 60 times 5 times (16-x).

Further, it holds that: [ 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) geq 2(ab + ac + bd + cd). ] This means: [ 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) geq 2(1 + ac + bd). ] 6.

By the properties of reflections, this also preserves angles and we have (widehat{B H' C} = widehat{B H C}). 2. **Using angle properties in cyclic quadrilaterals:** - Since (widehat{B H C}) and (widehat{H_B H H_C}) are vertically opposite angles, they are equal. Hence, (widehat{B H C} = widehat{H_B H H_C}). - According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem in the cyclic quadrilateral (A H_B H H_C), we know that: [ widehat{H_B H H_C} = 180^circ - widehat{H_B A H_C} ] - Therefore: [ widehat{C H' B} = widehat{C H B} = widehat{H_B H H_C} = 180^circ - widehat{H_B A H_C} = 180^circ - widehat{B A C} ] 3. **Conclusion from angle equality:** - Given that the sum of internal angles of a triangle is (180^circ), it follows from the converse of the Inscribed Angle Theorem that points (A, B, C,) and (H') are concyclic. 4. **Now, consider the second part of the problem where (H'') is the symmetric of (H) with respect to the midpoint of ([BC]):** - Let (M) be the midpoint of segment ([BC]). By definition, (H M = H'' M). - In the quadrilateral (H B H'' C), the diagonals bisect each other (since (M) is the midpoint), implying that it is a parallelogram. - Consequently, the angles are maintained: [ widehat{C H'' B} = widehat{C H B} ] 5. **Reapplying cyclic angle properties:** - Following the same reasoning as before: [ widehat{C H'' B} = widehat{C H B} = widehat{H_C H H_B} = 180^circ - widehat{H_B A H_C} = 180^circ - widehat{B A C} ] 6. **Final Conclusion:** - Thus, according to the converse of the Inscribed Angle Theorem, points (A, B, C,) and (H'') are concyclic as well.

Spheres' Properties and Proof: Consider the surface ( S ) and let ( K ) be a plane section of this surface, which is a circle. Let ( L ) be an axis of the circle ( K ), i.e., a line passing through the center of ( K ) perpendicular to its plane. 1. Let ( P ) be a plane passing through ( L ). This plane intersects ( S ) in some circle ( C(P) ). 2. The circle ( C(P) ) intersects ( K ) in two points ( A ) and ( B ) diametrically opposite each other. 3. Clearly, the chord ( AB ) of the circle ( C(P) ) has the axis ( L ) as its perpendicular bisector. Since the axis of the symmetry of a chord of a circle passes through its center, ( L ) passes through the center of ( C(P) ) and intersects it in two diametrically opposite points ( M ) and ( N ). 4. Therefore, every circle ( C(P) ) obtained by intersecting ( S ) with different planes ( P ) passing through ( L ) contains the same two points ( M ) and ( N ). 5. Obviously, there do not exist other points of ( L ) belonging to ( S ). Hence, the line segment ( MN ) on the line ( L ) is a common diameter for all circles ( C(P) ). Thus, all these circles can be obtained by rotating one of them around the diameter ( MN ). Hence, the set of all sections of ( S ) by planes containing ( L ) gives us a sphere ( Sigma ), which is part of the surface ( S ). Since ( S ) cannot contain any points other than those of ( Sigma ) (otherwise, the intersection of ( S ) by a plane passing through an additional point ( T ) and ( L ) would not be a circle), we conclude that the surface ( S ) is the sphere ( Sigma ).

If we place four identical spheres with radius ( r ) such that they touch each other, their centers form a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( 2r ). 2. When we add a fifth sphere touching three of the initial four spheres, we create subsequent potential nooks for sphere placement. The resulting figure, the star-like polyhedron, now consists of four additional tetrahedra around each face of the central tetrahedron. Each of the new tetrahedrons is such that it can contain one sphere each. After placing these four spheres: - We have a total of 8 spheres. - The number of new nooks formed by these 8 spheres is given by the dual polyhedron structure — resulting in 12 new nooks. Thus: - From 8 spheres, we get 12 nooks for the next possible layer. Continuing this structure indefinitely involves a growing number of tetrahedra and spaces but careful construction will provide us with more nooks at every step with each new layer. Therefore: boxed{ text{You can continue this process indefinitely by providing more nooks and spheres with every new layer until space constraints occur.} } 47b. Sphere Packing (II): Given an infinite number of identical spheres, 1. Place one sphere, considering it as the first layer. 2. Arrange 12 spheres around it, each touching the central sphere and two neighboring spheres, forming the second layer. The packing forms a regular dodecahedron around the central sphere. 3. For the third layer, you obtain positions (nooks) among the existing layers: [ text{Each triangular face of a polyhedron from its nooks gives rise to the next layer.} ] Summarizing: - First layer: 1 sphere. - Second layer: 12 spheres. - Every new layer forms around the gaps of previous layers.

For how many pages printed for the spreads does the press print a block of 4 ads?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we know that each brochure is made up of 5 pages. Since there are 25 brochures, the total number of pages needed for the brochures is: 25 brochures * 5 pages/brochure = 125 pages Now, let's consider the single-page spreads and double-page spreads. The press prints 20 single-page spreads and twice as many double-page spreads. So, it prints: 20 single-page spreads + 2 * 20 double-page spreads = 20 + 40 = 60 double-page spreads Since a double-page spread is equivalent to 2 pages, the total number of pages from the double-page spreads is: 60 double-page spreads * 2 pages/double-page spread = 120 pages Now, we have 125 pages needed for the brochures and 120 pages provided by the double-page spreads. This leaves us with: 125 pages needed - 120 pages from double-page spreads = 5 pages These 5 pages will come from the single-page spreads. Since we have 20 single-page spreads and we only need 5 more pages, we have: 20 single-page spreads - 5 pages needed = 15 single-page spreads left Now, let's consider the blocks of 4 ads. Each ad takes up a quarter of a page, so a block of 4 ads takes up one full page. We need to find out how many pages are printed for the spreads for each block of 4 ads. Since we have 15 single-page spreads left after creating the brochures, and each block of 4 ads takes up one page, the press prints a block of 4 ads for every page of the remaining 15 single-page spreads. Therefore, the press prints a block of 4 ads for every page printed for the spreads, which in this case is boxed{15} pages."},{"prompt":"Yoongi can choose 3 out of 10 classes for afterschool classes.

We need to show that the circumcircle of triangle ( CBN ) is tangent to the line ( AD ) at point ( D ). 1. Let us denote the point of tangency as ( T ). 2. Since BC parallel AD, it follows that ( BT = CT ). This is because, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, hence the distances from point of tangency to points on parallel lines are equal. 3. Given that ( angle NBT = angle NCT ), it implies the equality of the corresponding triangles ( triangle ABT ) and ( triangle NCT ). The angles subtended by the chords in the circumcircle are equal in measure. 4. Consequently, we get: [ angle TAB = angle TNC = angle TBC = angle TCB. ] 5. This shows that Figure ABCT is a parallelogram because angles ( angle TAB ) and ( angle TBC) help us deduce that all sides around point T align perfectly with the corresponding points around point D. 6. Hence, the point ( T ) coincides with point ( D ). Therefore, the claim that the circumcircle is tangent to ( AD ) at ( D ) is validated. Alternatively, 1. Notice that point ( T ) lies on the ray ( AD ). 2. Given that ( CN = AB = CD ), we can infer that: [ angle CND = angle CDN = angle AND. ] This implies that ( ND ) bisects ( angle ANC ). 3. Similarly, observe that: [ angle ATN = angle TCN quad text{and} quad angle TAN = 180^{circ} - angle CBN = angle CTN. ] Therefore, ( angle ANT = angle TNC ) making ( NT ) also the bisector of ( angle ANC ). 4.

Therefore, we can write the following equation: [ v_c - v_s - 2 = 9 ] When the canoe is going downstream, it is moving with the stream, so the effective speed of the canoe is increased by the speed of the stream. Additionally, the wind is affecting the canoe's speed by 1 km/hr in the downstream direction. The downstream speed of the canoe is given as 12 km/hr.

Provide all possible answers and prove that there are no other solutions.","completion":"Let's break down the problem step-by-step to understand the relationship between the given segments and prove the required ratio. Step 1: Understanding the Position of Point K First, note that the circle (omega) is inscribed in the convex quadrilateral (ABCD) and touches side (AB) at point (M) and side (CD) at point (N). The circle's center is (I). Given that point (K) on the line (MN) is selected such that (AK = AM), this means point (K) is symmetric to point (M) with respect to line (MN). This gives us the insight that (K) lies on the extension of line segment (AM). Step 2: Analyzing Geometric Properties Since (AK = AM) and circle (omega) is inscribed, all tangents from a point to a circle are equal. Thus, in the quadrilateral, the tangent segments from vertices to the point of tangency with the circle are equal. Let’s denote the points where the circle touches the sides (BC) and (DA) as (P) and (Q) respectively. Step 3: Tangent Segments Let's denote: - (AM = AK = x) - (DN = DN = y) - (BM = BP = z) - (CQ = CM = w) Since (omega) is inscribed: [ AM + MB = AN + ND implies x + z = w + y ] Step 4: Calculate coordinate of points on (MN) Let's consider the line (MN) where point (M) lies on (AB) and point (N) lies on (CD). Since (M) and (N) are points of tangency, (I) must lie on the angle bisectors of (angle DAB) and (angle BCD) because the incenter of a polygon is generally the point where the angle bisectors intersect. Since we have the symmetry condition (AK = AM), it implies that the geometry will naturally bring point (K) to the exact halfway point (or midpoint) of (MN) because: [ KM = MN ] Step 5: Ratio Calculation Since we assume (D) to (I) line to be the bisector, and point (K) lies at the center of (MN) for symmetric property, intersecting point on this symmetrical line would divide (KN) in equal ratio, that is: [ frac{DK}{IN} = frac{KN}{MD} = 1:1 ] Thus, the ratio (DI) divides the segment (KN) in the ratio (1:1).

Combined with the finite nature of single-digit numbers, the sequence must eventually repeat, indicating periodicity. 2. **Periodicity Justification:** Let's assume the reappearance of the set 1975: Given the deterministic nature, the occurrence of any four-digit combination in the sequence will force the same further sequence to follow. Therefore, 1975 must appear again at some point due to the periodic nature derived from finite combinations. Thus, the sequence 1975 will appear again: [ boxed{text{Sequence 1975 appears again.}} ] c) Will the sequence 8197 appear? 1. **Redundancy and Sequence Periodicity:** Having determined that sequence periodicity ensures repetitions, we analyze digits preceding 1975.

Given that R_1 = R_2, and noting that angle ABC + angle ABD = 180^circ (as they are supplementary angles in the parallelogram), we have: [ AC = 2 R_1 sin(angle ABC) ] and [ BD = 2 R_2 sin(180^circ - angle ABC) = 2 R_1 sin(angle ABC) ] 4. Thus: [ AC = BD ] 5. Since the diagonals of the parallelogram are equal, the parallelogram ABCD must be a rectangle.

The total number of ways to select 2 letters from 4 is given by the combination formula binom{4}{2}. This equals 6. However, there is only 1 way to select both M and P, which are the letters we need.

The total number of ways to select 4 letters from 5 is given by the combination formula binom{5}{4}. This equals 5.

This implies: [ x equiv y pmod{100} ] Hence, their difference (x - y) is divisible by 100: [ (x - y) equiv 0 pmod{100} ] This guarantees (100) divides their difference, i.e., (x - y) is divisible by 100. 5. **Consider the case where the remainders are complementary**: Alternatively, if two numbers in the group have complementary remainders (a) and (100 - a), their sum will be divisible by 100: [ x equiv a pmod{100} quad text{and} quad y equiv 100 - a pmod{100} ] Hence, their sum (x + y) is exactly 100: [ (x + y) equiv (a + (100 - a)) pmod{100} ] [ (x + y) equiv 100 pmod{100} ] This guarantees (100) divides their sum, i.e., (x + y) is divisible by 100. **Conclusion**: Because there are only 51 groups of possible remainders and we have 52 numbers, by the Pigeonhole Principle, we can always find at least two numbers among the 52 such that either their sum or their difference is divisible by 100.

Let B and C be chosen points that are at a distance of 1 and 2 from A, respectively. Distances are measured along the circumference of the circle. 2. **Order of Points:** The arrangement A, B, C is impossible. This is because if we arrange the points in this order, there would be two chosen points at a distance of 1 from point B. This violates the conditions. Thus, the points must be ordered differently. One possible order that satisfies the condition would be C, A, B or B, A, C. 3. **Next Point and Further Analysis:** Consider the point D, which is at a distance of 1 from C. If we proceed with the arrangement C, A, B, then point D must follow B. Hence, D would be located at D, C, A, B, which is also impossible. Therefore, we must place D such that the order becomes D, C, A, B. Continuing this approach, if E is the next point at a distance of 1 from B, the order within the chosen points must be D, C, A, B, E. 4. **Partitioning the Circle:** Continuing this arrangement, we notice a pattern that repeats every 3 units. Thus, the circle of length 1956 gets divided into segments of length 3. The number of such segments is: [ frac{1956}{3} = 652 ] 5. **Calculating Total Points:** On each of these 652 segments, there is exactly one point.

Since M and N lie on this asymptote, for point M, we have n = frac{b}{a}m. 3. **Rectangle Area Calculation**: The area of the rectangle formed by F_1, F_2, M, and N is given as 2sqrt{6}a^2.

This is because the main term k^m becomes dominant and the addition of the reciprocal k^{-m} has less influence as m gets larger. Using this logic, we compare (lg x)^m with (lg x)^n.

To analyze the areas of the two parts created by a line passing through ( S ), we need to use some geometric properties. 1. **Initial Setup**: - The line ( e ) through the centroid ( S ) and parallel to the side ( AB ) divides triangle ( ABC ). - Since ( e ) is parallel to ( AB ), triangles ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle MNC ) are similar. - Similarity ratio ( = frac{2}{3} ). 2. **Area Calculation**: - For similar triangles, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

For O and B: p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = p^2 + (q - beta)^2 + r^2 3. For O and C: p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = p^2 + q^2 + (r - gamma)^2 Simplifying each equation, we get: 1. From the first equation: p^2 + q^2 + r^2 = p^2 - 2alpha p + alpha^2 + q^2 + r^2 - This simplifies to 2alpha p = alpha^2, and since alpha neq 0, we have alpha = 2p. 2. Similarly, from the second equation, we find beta = 2q. 3. And from the third equation, gamma = 2r. Given the points of intersection, the equation of plane ABC can be expressed as frac{x}{alpha} + frac{y}{beta} + frac{z}{gamma} = 1. Substituting alpha = 2p, beta = 2q, and gamma = 2r, we rewrite the equation as frac{x}{2p} + frac{y}{2q} + frac{z}{2r} = 1. Since (a,b,c) lies on this plane, we substitute these values into the plane's equation, yielding frac{a}{2p} + frac{b}{2q} + frac{c}{2r} = 1. Multiplying the entire equation by 2, we find frac{a}{p} + frac{b}{q} + frac{c}{r} = 2.

To achieve this, we use mathematical induction on n to show that a_n leq a_1 for all n = 1, 2, 3, ldots. **Base case**: For n=1, the statement a_1 leq a_1 is trivially true. **Induction step**: Assume the statement is true for n=k, i.e., a_k leq a_1. We need to show it also holds for n=k+1. The given inequality for the sequence is: [ (i+j)a_{i+j} leq j a_i + i a_j ] Setting i = 1 and j = k, we get: [ (1 + k) a_{k+1} leq k a_1 + 1 a_k ] Using the induction hypothesis a_k leq a_1, it follows: [ (k + 1) a_{k+1} leq k a_1 + a_1 = (k+1) a_1 ] Dividing both sides by (k+1), we get: [ a_{k+1} leq a_1 ] This completes the induction step. Hence, by induction, a_n leq a_1 for all n in mathbb{N}. 2. **Showing the sequence is bounded below:** Since the sequence consists of positive terms, it is trivially bounded below by 0. Combining these, we conclude that the sequence {a_n} is bounded. 3. **Existence of the greatest lower bound:** The sequence is positive and bounded above. Therefore, it is also bounded below by some value. According to the completeness property of the real numbers, any bounded sequence has a least upper bound (supremum) and a greatest lower bound (infimum). Let A be the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the sequence {a_n}. 4. **Proving convergence to the infimum:** To show that the sequence is convergent and its limit is A, we need to prove that for any given varepsilon > 0, there exists an N in mathbb{N}, such that for all n geq N, a_n < A + varepsilon. Since A is the greatest lower bound, for every varepsilon > 0, there exists an element a_k of the sequence such that: [ a_k < A + frac{varepsilon}{2} ] From the sequence's definition and the inequalities provided, for any l, we have: [ a_{k+l} leq frac{l a_k + k a_l}{k+l} ] Plugging in the bound for a_k: [ a_{k+l} < frac{l left(A + frac{varepsilon}{2}right) + k a_l}{k+l} ] Simplifying further by overestimating the denominator: [ a_{k+l} < left(A + frac{varepsilon}{2}right) + frac{k a_l}{l} ] For large l, the term frac{k a_l}{l} can be made arbitrarily small. Specifically, if l > frac{2k a_1}{varepsilon}, we have: [ frac{k a_l}{l} < frac{varepsilon}{2} ] Therefore, [ a_{k+l} < A + frac{varepsilon}{2} + frac{varepsilon}{2} = A + varepsilon ] This shows that a_n < A + varepsilon for n large enough.

In that time, l would have covered a distance of ( 3 times v_l = 3 times 50 = 150 ) km. k starts at 10 a.m. and they meet at 12 p.m., so k has been traveling for 2 hours. Let's denote the distance covered by k in that time as ( d_k ). Since they are initially 300 km apart and meet after l has traveled 150 km, k must have covered the remaining distance, which is ( 300 - 150 = 150 ) km.

Now, we need to find the percentage by which k is faster than l. The difference in their speeds is ( v_k - v_l = 75 - 50 = 25 ) km/hr.

Similarly, let (mathbf{n}_2 = (x_2, y_2, z_2)) be a normal vector to the plane ( PCD ).

Since the pen costs 9 more than the pencil, and the pencil costs 2, the pen costs: Pen cost = Pencil cost + 9 Pen cost = 2 + 9 Pen cost = 11 Next, let's find the cost of the notebook. The notebook costs twice as much as the pen, so: Notebook cost (before discount) = 2 * Pen cost Notebook cost (before discount) = 2 * 11 Notebook cost (before discount) = 22 Now, let's apply the 15% discount to the notebook: Discount amount = 15% of Notebook cost (before discount) Discount amount = 0.15 * 22 Discount amount = 3.30 So, the cost of the notebook after the discount is: Notebook cost (after discount) = Notebook cost (before discount) - Discount amount Notebook cost (after discount) = 22 - 3.30 Notebook cost (after discount) = 18.70 Now, let's find the total cost of all three items: Total cost = Pencil cost + Pen cost + Notebook cost (after discount) Total cost = 2 + 11 + 18.70 Total cost = 31.70 Finally, let's convert the total cost from Canadian dollars to US dollars using the conversion rate of 1.25: Total cost in USD = Total cost in CAD * Conversion rate Total cost in USD = 31.70 * 1.25 Total cost in USD = 39.625 Since we typically round to the nearest cent, the total cost in US dollars would be: Total cost in USD = boxed{39.63}"},{"prompt":"Let ( A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 ) be the images of points ( A, B, C, D ) under an affine transformation.

We are given that: overrightarrow{AB} = overrightarrow{CD} We need to prove that: overrightarrow{A_1 B_1} = overrightarrow{C_1 D_1} 2. **Considering Non-collinear Points**: First, assume that points (A), (B), (C), and (D) do not lie on the same straight line. We can say that (ABCD) forms a parallelogram because: overrightarrow{AB} = overrightarrow{CD} This indicates that opposite sides are equal and parallel, thus forming a parallelogram. 3. **Affine Transformation Preserving Parallelograms**: By the properties of the affine transformation, affine transformations preserve parallelism and midpoint between points (an affine transformation of a parallelogram is still a parallelogram). Therefore, the images (A_1), (B_1), (C_1), and (D_1) should also form a parallelogram: A_1B_1C_1D_1 text{ is a parallelogram} Hence, the opposite vectors in this new parallelogram will still be equal: overrightarrow{A_1 B_1} = overrightarrow{C_1 D_1} 4. **Considering Collinear Points**: Now assume that points (A), (B), (C), and (D) lie on the same straight line.

Based on the transformation properties, we have: overrightarrow{A_1 B_1} = overrightarrow{E_1 F_1} 6. **Equality of Vectors**: Since affine transformations preserve parallel vectors and the corresponding equality holds in the affine plane, we conclude: overrightarrow{E_1 F_1} = overrightarrow{C_1 D_1} Therefore: overrightarrow{A_1 B_1} = overrightarrow{C_1 D_1} # Conclusion: After considering both the cases where the points are collinear and non-collinear, we have shown that the condition overrightarrow{AB} = overrightarrow{CD} ensures overrightarrow{A_1 B_1} = overrightarrow{C_1 D_1} under an affine transformation.

Since 72 minutes is 1.2 hours (72/60), and car X travels at 35 miles per hour, the distance car X traveled in that time is: Distance = Speed × Time Distance_X_before_Y = 35 mph × 1.2 hours = 42 miles Now, let's set up an equation to find out how long it takes for car Y to catch up to car X after it starts moving. Let t be the time in hours that car Y travels until both cars have traveled the same distance. Since car X has a head start of 42 miles, we can write the equation for the distance each car travels as follows: Distance_X = Distance_Y + 42 miles We know that Distance = Speed × Time, so we can write: 35 mph × (t + 1.2 hours) = 41 mph × t + 42 miles Now we solve for t: 35t + 35 × 1.2 = 41t + 42 35t + 42 = 41t + 42 35t + 42 - 42 = 41t 35t = 41t Subtract 35t from both sides: 0 = 6t This equation suggests that t would be 0, which doesn't make sense in this context because car Y has to travel for some time to catch up to car X. It seems there might be a mistake in the setup of the equation. Let's try again. The correct equation should be: 35 mph × (t + 1.2 hours) = 41 mph × t Now we solve for t: 35t + 42 = 41t 42 = 41t - 35t 42 = 6t Now divide both sides by 6 to solve for t: t = 42 / 6 t = 7 hours So, car Y catches up to car X after 7 hours.

Without any leaks, the tank can supply water for 60 days. Therefore, the daily usage of the village is ( frac{C}{60} ) liters per day. With a single leak that drains out 10 liters per day, the supply lasts for 45 days. This means that the daily usage of the village plus the leak is ( frac{C}{45} ) liters per day. Now, we can set up an equation to find the daily usage of the village: [ frac{C}{60} + 10 = frac{C}{45} ] Multiplying both sides by 60 * 45 to get rid of the denominators: [ 45C + 10 times 60 times 45 = 60C ] [ 45C + 27000 = 60C ] Subtracting 45C from both sides: [ 27000 = 15C ] Dividing both sides by 15: [ C = 1800 ] So the total capacity of the tank is 1800 liters.

The 30% who do not cover local politics are also part of the group that covers politics but are not included in the 28%. Let's denote the percentage of reporters who cover politics as P. The 30% who do not cover local politics are part of this P, so we can write: P - 28% = 30% of P This equation states that the difference between the total percentage of reporters who cover politics (P) and those who cover local politics (28%) is equal to 30% of the total percentage of reporters who cover politics (P). To solve for P, we can rewrite the equation as: P - 0.3P = 28% 0.7P = 28% P = 28% / 0.7 P = 40% So, 40% of the reporters cover politics (both local and non-local).

This means the area of the big triangle is 100 times the area of one small triangle. 3. To cover the big triangle entirely with small triangles, we need as many small triangles as the factor by which the area of the big triangle is larger than the area of a small triangle. Since the big triangle's area is 100 times that of a small one, we need 100 small triangles to cover the big triangle completely.

This requires more exploration: 1. Assume the triangle is a scaled 3-4-5 triangle, with legs (a) and (b), and hypotenuse (c = 4). Since (3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2), let’s scale down the 5 to 4, ( frac{4}{5} times 3 ) and ( frac{4}{5} times 4 ) for the legs. This gives us ( frac{12}{5} ) and ( frac{16}{5} ) for the leg lengths. 2. The area of the smaller triangle is ( frac{1}{2} times frac{12}{5} times frac{16}{5} = frac{96}{25} = 3.84 ), which is incorrect. Let's adjust the assumption; we need another set of integers that fit the hypotenuse and give the required area of 8 square inches. After reevaluating, we realize the assumption of a scaled 3-4-5 triangle does not work. Let's try a different approach: - Assume legs (a) and (b) such that ( frac{1}{2}ab = 8 ) and ( a^2 + b^2 = 16 ) (since the hypotenuse squared must equal the sum of the squares of the legs). - From ( ab = 16 ) and ( a^2 + b^2 = 16 ), we solve these equations. Setting ( a = frac{16}{b} ): [ left(frac{16}{b}right)^2 + b^2 = 16 frac{256}{b^2} + b^2 = 16 256 + b^4 = 16b^2 b^4 - 16b^2 + 256 = 0 (b^2 - 8)^2 = 0 b^2 = 8 Rightarrow b = 2sqrt{2}, a = 2sqrt{2} ] - Therefore, the smaller triangle is an isosceles right triangle with legs (2sqrt{2}), and the area is indeed 8 square inches.

Initial equation manipulation: gcd(n,120) = mathop{text{lcm}}[n,120] - 360. Because mathop{text{lcm}}[n,120] is a multiple of 120, this implies gcd(n,120) must be a multiple of 120. 2. Since gcd(n,120) must divide 120, the only possible values for gcd(n,120) under the above constraints are 60 and 120. We explore both scenarios: - gcd(n,120) = 60: mathop{text{lcm}}[n,120] = 60 + 360 = 420. Yet, since mathop{text{lcm}}[n,120] is a multiple of 120, 420 is not valid. - gcd(n,120) = 120: mathop{text{lcm}}[n,120] = 120 + 360 = 480. By definition, mathop{text{lcm}}[n,120] = 120 if and only if n is a multiple of 120. Therefore, 480 = 120 steers clear as invalid, revealing a mistake in the initial GCD conditions. 3. The only consistent scenario: - Since it doesn't fit that gcd(n,120) = 60, we must have that gcd(n,120) = 120, meaning n must itself be 120 based on the LCM condition we derived. - Checking n = 120: gcd(120, 120) = 120, mathop{text{lcm}}[120, 120] = 120, mathop{text{lcm}}[120, 120] = gcd(120, 120) + 360 Rightarrow 120 = 120 + 360, which is not valid since it leads to an incorrect statement. 4.

Since there are 100 lampposts, there are ( 100 - 1 = 99 ) intervals. 2. Petya starts at the 1st lamppost and progresses to the 22nd lamppost, which means Petya covers ( 22 - 1 = 21 ) intervals. 3.

Since Petya and Vasya travel simultaneously, the times for both Petya and Vasya to reach these positions are the same.

Is it true that their areas are equal?","completion":"1. **Introduction and Problem Restatement:** We need to show that if the midpoints of the sides of two polygons ( K ) and ( L ) with ( 2n ) sides (where ( n geq 2 )) coincide, then the areas of ( K ) and ( L ) are equal. 2. **Base Case ( n = 2 ):** If ( n = 2 ), then ( K ) and ( L ) are quadrilaterals. It's known that the midpoints of the sides of a quadrilateral form a parallelogram whose sides are parallel to the diagonals of the quadrilateral, and their lengths are half the lengths of the diagonals. Therefore, if the midpoints of ( K ) and ( L ) coincide, the corresponding diagonals of ( K ) and ( L ) are equal in length and parallel. Given that the area of a quadrilateral with diagonals of lengths ( e ) and ( f ), and angle ( varphi ) between them, is: [ T = frac{e cdot f cdot sin varphi}{2} ] The equality of diagonals and their angles implies ( K ) and ( L ) have the same area. 3. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume the statement holds for polygons with ( 2k ) sides. That is, if the midpoints of the sides of two such polygons coincide, then their areas are equal. 4. **Induction Step for ( 2(k+1) ) sides:** Let ( K ) and ( L ) be polygons with ( 2(k+1) ) sides, such that their side midpoints coincide. Denote the vertices of ( K ) as ( K_1, K_2, ldots, K_{2k+2} ) and the vertices of ( L ) as ( L_1, L_2, ldots, L_{2k+2} ), where ( F_i ) is the common midpoint of sides ( K_i K_{i+1} ) and ( L_i L_{i+1} ). 5. Draw the diagonals ( K_1 K_4 ) and ( L_1 L_4 ). These diagonals divide both ( K ) and ( L ) into smaller polygons: a quadrilateral and a ( 2k )-gon. The quadrilaterals formed are ( K_1 K_2 K_3 K_4 ) and ( L_1 L_2 L_3 L_4 ), whose remaining midpoints coincide by assumption. 6. Since the midpoints of the sides of the quadrilaterals ( K_1 K_2 K_3 K_4 ) and ( L_1 L_2 L_3 L_4 ) coincide, by the base case, these quadrilaterals have equal areas. 7. The remaining ( 2k )-gons formed, ( K' ) and ( L' ), also have coinciding midpoints, implying by the induction hypothesis, their areas are equal. 8. Therefore, the total area of ( K ) is the sum of the areas of the quadrilateral and the ( 2k )-gon it divides into. Similarly, for ( L ). 9. Since both divided parts in ( K ) and ( L ) are equal in area, the entire polygons ( K ) and ( L ) must also have equal areas. 10. **Conclusion:** Thus, by induction, we have shown if the midpoints of the sides of two polygons with any even number of sides coincide, the polygons have equal areas. (blacksquare) # Remark: For polygons with an odd number of sides, not only would their areas be equal if the midpoints coincide, but the polygons would also be congruent.

This means each sheep will move up and down along a line perpendicular to L. 4. **Threat Analysis**: - The wolf aims to capture a sheep by getting within a 1 meter distance. - Suppose the wolf threatens a specific sheep, denoted as S. This requires the wolf to move towards sheep S. 5. **Sheep's Move to Evade Capture**: - The threatened sheep S can always move away on the line perpendicular to L, maintaining a distance greater than 1 meter from the wolf. - Since the wolf’s movement is limited to 1 meter per turn, it cannot catch the sheep if the sheep moves directly away along the perpendicular line. 6. **Sheep's Win Strategy**: - This evasion strategy can be repeated for any turn where a sheep is threatened. - Each move ensures that no sheep is captured by constantly keeping a safe distance. # Conclusion: Thus, the second player can always ensure that the sheep cannot be captured by placing them initially on a line with 3 meters between adjacent sheep and moving them perpendicularly to L in response to any threat.

( n ) is a composite number. 2. It is possible to arrange all the divisors of ( n ) greater than 1 in a circle such that any two adjacent numbers are not coprime. 2. **Analyzing Composite Numbers:** Consider any composite number ( n ). Composite numbers can be categorized into different forms: - ( n ) is the product of two distinct prime numbers, ( n = p cdot q ). - ( n ) is a power of a single prime, ( n = p^alpha ) where ( alpha geq 2 ). - ( n ) is the product of more than two prime factors, possibly each raised to some power. 3. **Case 1: ( n = p cdot q )** Let's first consider the case where ( n ) is the product of two distinct primes ( p ) and ( q ): - The divisors of ( n ) greater than 1 are ( {p, q, pq} ). - In any arrangement of these numbers in a circle, both ( p ) and ( q ) will end up adjacent. - Since ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes, they are coprime, i.e., ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ). - Therefore, ( n = p cdot q ) doesn’t satisfy the second condition because there is no way to arrange ( {p, q, pq} ) such that all adjacent pairs are not coprime. 4. **Case 2: ( n = p^alpha ) where ( alpha geq 2 )** Now consider a composite number which is a power of a single prime: - For ( n = p^alpha ), the divisors greater than 1 are ( {p, p^2, p^3, ldots, p^alpha} ). - Arranging these in a circle, each pair of adjacent numbers will have ( p ) as a common factor. - Since ( p ) divides each of these divisors, the pairs cannot be coprime. - This clearly satisfies the given conditions. 5. **Case 3: ( n ) with more than two distinct prime factors ( k > 2 ) or ( max(alpha_1, alpha_2) geq 2 )** For a number ( n ) that is a product of more than two primes: - Suppose ( n = prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{alpha_i} ) where ( p_1 < p_2 < ldots < p_k ) are primes and ( alpha_i ) are positive integers. - If ( k > 2 ), or if ( k = 2 ) and at least one of the primes is raised to a power greater than or equal to 2, the number of factors and multiplicity create a suitable number of divisors with shared prime factors. - Arrange ( n, p_1 p_2, p_2 p_3, ldots, p_{k-1} p_k ) in a circle. - This ensures that appropriate groupings are non-coprime due to shared factors among ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ). - Place smaller prime multiples between these main adjacent steps, ensuring all adjacent numbers share common factors (non-coprime). 6. **Conclusion:** The detailed condition analysis reveals that all permissible ( n ) must fit the form ( n = p^alpha ) for a prime ( p ) and integer ( alpha geq 2 ).

If 45 more associates were hired, the ratio of partners to associates would be 1 : 34. There are currently 18 partners in the firm. What is the initial ratio of partners to associates?","completion":"Let's denote the current number of associates as A. According to the information given, if 45 more associates were hired, the ratio of partners to associates would be 1:34. This means that for every partner, there would be 34 associates. Since there are currently 18 partners, after hiring 45 more associates, the number of associates would be 34 times the number of partners. So, we can write the equation: ( 18 times 34 = A + 45 ) Now, let's solve for A: ( 18 times 34 = A + 45 ) ( 612 = A + 45 ) ( A = 612 - 45 ) ( A = 567 ) This means that currently, there are 567 associates in the firm. Now, we need to find the initial ratio of partners to associates. We have 18 partners and 567 associates, so the ratio is: ( frac{Partners}{Associates} = frac{18}{567} ) To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor of 18 and 567. The greatest common divisor of 18 and 567 is 9. ( frac{18}{567} = frac{18 div 9}{567 div 9} ) ( frac{18}{567} = frac{2}{63} ) So, the initial ratio of partners to associates is 1:31.5. However, since we are looking for a ratio of whole numbers, we can multiply both sides of the ratio by 2 to get rid of the decimal: ( frac{2 times 2}{63 times 2} = frac{4}{126} ) Now, we can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: ( frac{4 div 2}{126 div 2} = frac{2}{63} ) So, the initial ratio of partners to associates is boxed{1:31.5,} which can also be expressed as 2:63 in whole numbers."},{"prompt":"A lent some money to B for 2 years and Rs. 3000 to C for 4 years on simple interest at the same rate of interest and received Rs. 1540 in all from both of them as interest.

First, note that since A B C is a right triangle with angle ACB = 90^circ, and A B is the hypotenuse, according to the properties of right triangles circumscribed by a circle, the hypotenuse A B will be the diameter of the circumscribing circle (Thales' theorem). 3. The additional square is constructed with its center O, and knowing that this square is external and based on the hypotenuse A B, implies that O lies equidistant from A and B. 4. Because A B serves as a diameter, both points C and O lie on the circle having A B as a diameter. This is due to the fact that angles subtended by the same arc are equal, specifically angle A C B = angle A O B is 90^circ. 5. Next, consider the arcs in the circle: - angle A C O is subtending the arc overset{frown}{A O}. - angle B C O is subtending the arc overset{frown}{B O}. 6. Since arcs overset{frown}{A O} and overset{frown}{B O} are equal (each subtends a 90^circ angle seeing A B is the diameter), angles A C O and B C O are also equal: [ angle A C O = angle B C O. ] 7.

For any divisor ( d_i = a_j p^l ) of ( n ), where ( a_j in S_q ) and ( l ) is a non-negative integer, we can write out the elements in matrix form as follows: [ begin{array}{ccccc} a_1, & a_1 p, & a_1 p^2, & ldots, & a_1 p^r a_2, & a_2 p, & a_2 p^2, & ldots, & a_2 p^r vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots a_k, & a_k p, & a_k p^2, & ldots, & a_k p^r end{array} ] Construct pairs ( (d_i, e_i) ), where for each ( d_i = a_j p^l ) with last digit 3, we pair it with ( a_j p^{l-1} ) or ( a_j p^{l+1} ). Noting that divisors derived from ( p ) (( p^2 equiv 9 pmod{10} )), ( p ) essentially contributes a last digit not equal to 3. Thus, any ( d_i ) with the last digit 3 will pair uniquely with some ( e_i ) not ending in 3. By ensuring this unique pairing for each ( d_i ) ending in 3, there cannot be more than half the elements of ( S_n ) that have a last digit 3. # Conclusion: We conclude that for any positive integer ( n ), the set ( S_n ) of all positive divisors of ( n ) contains at most half of its elements such that their last digit is 3.

We start by analyzing the given sum: [ N = sum_{a_1 = 0}^2 sum_{a_2 = 0}^{a_1} sum_{a_3 = 0}^{a_2} dots sum_{a_{2011} = 0}^{a_{2010}} left [ prod_{n=1}^{2011} a_n right ]. ] 2. Notice that each (a_i) can take values from 0 to 2, and the sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2011}) is non-increasing. This means that (a_1 geq a_2 geq cdots geq a_{2011}). 3. The product (prod_{n=1}^{2011} a_n) will be zero if any (a_n = 0). Therefore, we only need to consider the cases where all (a_n) are either 1 or 2. 4. If all (a_n = 1), the product is (1). If all (a_n = 2), the product is (2^{2011}). 5. We need to count the number of non-increasing sequences of length 2011 where each element is either 1 or 2. This is equivalent to choosing a subset of positions to be 2 (the rest will be 1). 6. The number of ways to choose (k) positions out of 2011 to be 2 is (binom{2011}{k}). Therefore, the sum can be written as: [ N = sum_{k=0}^{2011} binom{2011}{k} cdot 2^k cdot 1^{2011-k} = sum_{k=0}^{2011} binom{2011}{k} cdot 2^k. ] 7. By the binomial theorem, we know that: [ sum_{k=0}^{2011} binom{2011}{k} cdot 2^k = (1+2)^{2011} = 3^{2011}. ] 8. Therefore, (N = 3^{2011}). 9. We need to find the remainder when (3^{2011}) is divided by 1000. This can be done using modular arithmetic and Euler's theorem. Euler's theorem states that if (a) and (n) are coprime, then (a^{phi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{n}), where (phi(n)) is Euler's totient function. 10. For (n = 1000), (phi(1000) = 1000 cdot (1 - frac{1}{2}) cdot (1 - frac{1}{5}) = 400). 11. Since (3) and (1000) are coprime, we have: [ 3^{400} equiv 1 pmod{1000}. ] 12. We can write (2011 = 5 cdot 400 + 11), so: [ 3^{2011} = 3^{5 cdot 400 + 11} = (3^{400})^5 cdot 3^{11} equiv 1^5 cdot 3^{11} equiv 3^{11} pmod{1000}. ] 13. Now we need to compute (3^{11} mod 1000): [ 3^2 = 9, ] [ 3^4 = 81, ] [ 3^8 = 6561 equiv 561 pmod{1000}, ] [ 3^{11} = 3^8 cdot 3^2 cdot 3 = 561 cdot 9 cdot 3 = 15183 equiv 183 pmod{1000}. ] The final answer is (boxed{183})."},{"prompt":"An isosceles triangle ABC with base AB has vertex C such that the altitude from C to AB measures 4.

The distances from A to M and B to N change, but the isosceles properties of triangle MON are preserved because OM = ON = 2. 3. **Calculation of angle MON**: - Given that O lies directly below the midpoint of AB at a fixed distance, angle MON corresponds to the angle subtended by half of radii OM and ON. - This configuration essentially forms an equilateral triangle among the points M, N, and O because each leg of such triangle OM, ON and segment MN are equal by circle's constant radius pushing against sides AC and BC. Hence, angle MON = 60^circ. 4. **Conclusion**: - By the circle properties, each angle in an equilateral triangle is 60^circ, and therefore, the arc MTN, which MON subtends, being that all sides are equal, is 60^circ cdot 2 = 120^circ.

This means no two points that are one unit apart can share the same color. 2. **Construct a Geometric Figure**: Consider an equilateral triangle ( ABC ) with each side equal to 1. 3. **Coloring of Vertices**: - According to our assumption, the vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) must all be different colors because each pair is at a distance of 1. 4. **Introduce Symmetry**: Let point ( A_1 ) be the reflection of point ( A ) across the line ( BC ). 5. **Symmetry Properties**: - By construction, ( A_1B = 1 ) and ( A_1C = 1 ). - Since ( A_1 ) is at an equal distance from both ( B ) and ( C ), and they are different colors, ( A_1 ) must be the same color as ( A ). 6. **Distance Calculation**: - The distance between ( A ) and ( A_1 ), which is a reflection over the midpoint of ( BC ), will be ( sqrt{3} ).

Note that each (a_i leq frac{1}{2}) and (b_i leq frac{1}{2}) (by assumption). 6. **Area Sum Calculation:** The area (A_i) of each trapezoid (or triangle) can be expressed in terms of its bases and height. For a trapezoid, the area is given by: [ A_i = frac{h_i}{2} (a_i + b_i) ] where (h_i) is the height of the trapezoid (or triangle). Sum up these areas over all trapezoids and triangles to compute the total area of the polygon: [ sum A_i = sum frac{h_i}{2} (a_i + b_i) ] 7. **Estimating the Total Area:** Given that (a_i leq frac{1}{2}) and (b_i leq frac{1}{2}), we have: [ a_i + b_i leq 1 ] Thus: [ A_i leq frac{h_i}{2} times 1 = frac{h_i}{2} ] The total area of the convex polygon formed by adding all the individual areas can be expressed as: [ sum A_i leq sum frac{h_i}{2} leq frac{1}{2} times sum h_i ] Since the sum of the heights (sum h_i leq 1), it follows that: [ sum A_i leq frac{1}{2} times 1 = frac{1}{2} ] This contradicts the initial given condition that the area of the convex polygon is greater than (frac{1}{2}). 8. **Conclusion:** Thus, our initial supposition must be incorrect. There must be a chord of length greater than ( frac{1}{2} ) within the convex polygon, parallel to any side of the square.

Prove that ( G ) contains a cycle such that all edges of this cycle can be removed without losing the connectedness of the resulting graph.","completion":"1. **Initial Vertex and Numbering**: - Consider an arbitrary vertex in the graph ( G ) and label it as ( 1 ). - Label all vertices with their distances to this vertex. Specifically, if ( i ) is a label of a vertex, assign the label ( i+1 ) to all adjacent vertices that have not been labeled yet. 2. **Ensuring All Vertices are Labeled**: - This labeling process continues since ( G ) is finite and connected, ensuring all vertices receive a label. 3. **Connectivity of Subgraphs**: - For each integer ( i ), the subgraph formed by vertices with labels up to ( i ) is connected. This is true because there exists a path from any vertex in this subgraph to the vertex labeled ( 1 ). 4. **Selection of Largest Label ( p )**: - Determine the largest label ( p ). Let ( n ) be the number of vertices in ( G ). - Initially consider the subgraph consisting of vertices with label ( p ). If this subgraph contains a cycle, the process stops here. 5. **Extension if No Cycle**: - If no cycle exists in the subgraph with label ( p ), extend it by including vertices with label ( p-1 ), and the corresponding edges. - Repeat this process, moving backwards in labels until a cycle is found. Given the assumptions, ( G ) will contain a cycle since the graph has at least (frac{3n}{2} geq n ) edges. 6. **Maximal ( k ) with Cyclic Subgraph**: - Let ( k ) be the largest integer such that the subgraph formed by vertices with labels ( k ) or higher contains a cycle. - Choose a minimal cycle ( C ) from this subgraph. 7. **Minimal Cycle ( C )**: - Note ( C ) cannot have a diagonal. We aim to show that removing ( C )'s edges does not disconnect the graph. 8. **Proof by Contradiction**: - Assume removing the edges of ( C ) disconnects the graph ( G ). Let's denote a disconnected component by ( S ). 9. **Component ( S ) Properties**: - ( S ) does not contain the vertex labeled ( 1 ) and therefore only includes vertices labeled ( k+1 ). - The component ( S ) does not contain a cycle because that would contradict the choice of ( k ). 10. **Degree Constraints and Contradiction**: - Any vertex in ( S ) has at least three adjacent vertices (since the degree is at least 3). - Suppose ( S ) has ( m ) vertices. Since ( S ) is connected, if it contains no cycle, ( m geq 4 ). - If ( A ) is a vertex in both ( S ) and ( C ), two edges incident on ( A ) from ( C ) are removed. 11. **Analysis of Remaining Edges of ( A )**: - If ( A ) has one remaining edge ( AX_A ), ( X_A notin C ) to avoid creating a diagonal in ( C ). - Extend similar logic if there are multiple vertices in ( S ) also in ( C ), such as ( B ). 12. **Verification Through Neighbor Analysis**: - Check vertices( X_A ) and ( X_B ), suppose they are same, leading ( C ) to be a specific polygon shape, deriving contradiction based on labels and such configurations leading to ( C ) as the smallest cycle being false. 13. **Degree Sum Analysis**: - Use degree sums to show further contradiction: subgraphs are constructed to have minimal cycles and specific properties on vertex labeling help ensure ( S ) must have cycle — contradiction by assumption it didn’t. 14. **Conclusion**: - Every case leads to contradiction, hence the components formed after removing ( C ) cannot lead to loss of connectivity. Therefore, removing the edges of ( C ) doesn't break the connectivity of ( G ).

The divisors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60. However, since B is a single-digit number, we can eliminate any divisors greater than 9.

We can quickly check each possible value of B: For B = 1: 105B = 105, which is not a multiple of 60. For B = 2: 105B = 210, which is not a multiple of 60. For B = 3: 105B = 315, which is not a multiple of 60. For B = 4: 105B = 420, which is a multiple of 60. For B = 5: 105B = 525, which is not a multiple of 60. For B = 6: 105B = 630, which is a multiple of 60. So, the possible values for B are 4 and 6. Let's find the corresponding A for each B: For B = 4: 60A = 105B = 420, so A = 420 / 60 = 7. For B = 6: 60A = 105B = 630, so A = 630 / 60 = 10.5, but A must be a single-digit integer, so B cannot be 6. Therefore, the only solution is A = 7 and B = 4.

We start with the given equation: [ 1 + x + x^2 + ldots + x^{n-1} = F(x) G(x), ] where ( F ) and ( G ) are polynomials with coefficients either ( 0 ) or ( 1 ). 2. Let us denote the polynomials ( F ) and ( G ) as follows: [ F(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ldots, ] [ G(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + ldots, ] [ F(x) G(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + ldots + c_{n-1} x^{n-1}, ] with ( c_0 = c_1 = c_2 = ldots = c_{n-1} = 1 ). 3. Clearly, since the constant term on the left side is 1, we have: [ a_0 = b_0 = 1. ] 4. Assume ( b_1 = ldots = b_{k-1} = 1 ) and ( b_k = 0 ) for some ( k geq 2 ) (such that for one of the polynomials, either ( F ) or ( G ), this condition holds). 5. Given the structure of ( G ), in this case, this implies: [ a_1 = a_2 = ldots = a_{k-1} = 0 ] and [ a_k = 1. ] 6. Now we show that ( G ) must have segments of consecutive ( 1 )'s, each of length ( k ), bordered by zeroes. Consequently, ( G ) can be expressed as a product of the polynomial ( 1 + x + ldots + x^{k-1} ) with another polynomial with coefficients 0 and 1. 7. Suppose a segment of consecutive 1's in ( G ) exceeds the length ( k ). If ( b_i = b_{i+1} = ldots = b_{i+k} = 1 ), then ( c_{i+k} geq a_0 b_{i+k} + a_k b_i = 2 ), which contradicts the initial condition where all ( c )-coefficients are 1. Therefore, the length of such segments cannot exceed ( k ). 8.

Notice there exist ( p ) and ( q ) such that ( a_p = b_q = 1 ) and ( p + q = i + j + 1 ) because ( c_{i + j + 1} = 1 ). Since ( b_{i+j+1} = 0 ), we have ( p > 0 ), thus ( p geq k ). 10. Therefore: [ q leq i + j + 1 - k < i + 1. ] This implies ( q ) is part of a previous segment of consecutive 1's of length ( k ). 11. Hence, in this segment, either ( q - j ) or ( q - j + k ) belongs. 12. In the first case: [ c_{i + 1} geq a_0 b_{i+1} + a_p b_{q - j} = 2, ] and in the second case: [ c_{i + k + 1} geq a_k b_{i+1} + a_p b_{q - j + k} = 2. ] Both scenarios lead to a contradiction since ( c )-coefficients can only be 1. 13. Thus, by contradiction, any segment of consecutive 1's must have a length not greater than ( k ), and the polynomial ( G ) can be expressed as: [ G = (1 + x + x^2 + ldots + x^{k-1})T(x), ] where ( T(x) ) is another polynomial with coefficients being either 0 or 1.

Base Case: Consider ( n = 1 ).

Thus, the base case holds. Inductive Step: Assume that for some ( n ), the set ({2, 3, ldots, 3n + 1} ) can be partitioned into ( n ) obtuse triples. We need to show that the set ({2, 3, ldots, 3(n+1) + 1} ) can be partitioned into ( n+1 ) obtuse triples. Let ( t = lfloor n / 2 rfloor < n ). By the induction hypothesis, there exists a partition of the set [ [2, 3t + 1] ] into ( t ) obtuse triples ( A_i' = {i, a_i', b_i'} ) for ( 2 leq i leq t+1 ). For new ( n+1 ): - Define new triples ( A_i = {i, a_i' + (n-t), b_i' + (n-t)} ) for ( 2 leq i leq t+1 ). - Then, these triples are disjoint and obtain lengths in ([2, t+1] cup [n+2, n+2t+1]). We need another set of triples to cover the remaining indices: - For each (i in [t+2, n+1]), define triples [ A_i = {i, n+t+i, 2n+i}. ] - These entries are disjoint, covering ([t+2, n+1] cup [n+2t+2, 2n+t+1] cup [2n+t+2, 3n+1]).

It is clear that we can place 2 angles of ( 60^circ ) such that they intersect at 4 points. This is because each angle has two rays, and the intersection of two angles will involve the intersection of these rays. 3. **Assumption for ( n = 3 )**: Now, we assume that we have 3 angles, ( A, B, ) and ( C ), each of ( 60^circ ), and we need to check if they can be placed such that each pair of angles intersects at exactly 4 points. 4. **Defining the rays**: Let ( l_A ) and ( r_A ) be the rays of angle ( A ) such that the directed angle between ( l_A ) and ( r_A ) is ( +60^circ ). Similarly, define ( l_B, r_B ) for angle ( B ) and ( l_C, r_C ) for angle ( C ). 5. **Condition for 4 intersection points**: For angles ( A ) and ( B ) to have 4 intersection points, the directed angle between ( l_B ) and ( l_A ) must be larger than ( +60^circ ). This ensures that the rays intersect in such a way that there are 4 intersection points. 6. **Checking the condition for 3 angles**: If we have 3 angles ( A, B, ) and ( C ), then the directed angles between ( (l_B, l_A), (l_C, l_B), ) and ( (l_A, l_C) ) must all be larger than ( +60^circ ). However, the sum of these directed angles must be less than or equal to ( +180^circ ) because they are all measured in the same plane. 7. **Contradiction**: The requirement that each pair of angles has a directed angle larger than ( +60^circ ) leads to a contradiction. Specifically, if each of the three directed angles is larger than ( +60^circ ), their sum would exceed ( +180^circ ), which is not possible in a plane. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it is not possible to place 3 angles of ( 60^circ ) on the plane such that each pair of angles intersects at exactly 4 points.

Let them be (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5) evenly distributed around a circle. - By properties of regular polygons, any three points of a regular pentagon do not lie on the same line. 3. **Addition of the Center Point**: - Add a sixth point (C) at the center of the circumcircle of the pentagon. 4. **Consider the Properties and the Constraints**: - Check if any three points lie on the same line: In a regular pentagon with a center point, no three points collinear. - Verify if any set of three points form an isosceles triangle: - The triangles formed by vertices of the pentagon with the center (C) as the third point are isosceles, because the distances from (C) to any vertex of the pentagon are equal. - For each (i), ( triangle A_i C A_{i+1} ) is isosceles. 5. **Conclusion**: - Since the regular pentagon and its center form sets of desired isosceles triangles and no sets of three points are collinear, this configuration meets the problem's requirements.

The smallest multiple of 13 greater than or equal to 200 is 13 times 16 = 208. The largest multiple of 13 less than 1000 is 13 times 76 = 988. 2. **Count the Multiples**: The multiples of 13 from 208 to 988 form an arithmetic sequence where (a = 208), (d = 13), and (l = 988).

However, if a digit is zero as hundreds digit, it would not count as a three-digit number. We need to check for valid multiples and their permutations. For simplicity, consider each multiple has 2-3 valid permutations (depending on unique or repeated digits).

Thus, we undercount when any permutation starts with zero. 4. **Adjust for Overcounting**: Some multiples will not have valid permutations. For instance, multiples like 403, 416, etc., might have permutations beginning with zero, which we must exclude. However, since we are considering valid permutations in a specified range and avoiding zeros in the hundred's place, the undercount simplifies to just counting unique valid permutations. 5. **Calculate Total Valid Numbers**: Assuming an average of about 2 valid permutations per multiple (considering some repetitions and invalid zero-starting permutations), we estimate: [ text{Total valid numbers} approx 61 times 2 = 122 ] 6. **Conclusion**: The estimate provides a rough count, but further detailed analysis per number would be needed for exact counting.

Par le théorème de Fermat-Little, nous savons que pour tout nombre premier ( q ) et pour tout entier ( a ) non divisible par ( q ), nous avons ( a^{q-1} equiv 1 pmod{q} ). En particulier, nous pouvons appliquer ce théorème pour ( a = p ), ce qui nous donne : [ p^{q-1} equiv 1 pmod{q} ] 6. Cela signifie que l'ordre de ( p ) modulo ( q ), noté ( operatorname{ord}_q(p) ), doit diviser à la fois ( p ) et ( q-1 ). Donc, ( operatorname{ord}_q(p) ) ne peut être que ( 1 ) ou ( p ) parce que ( p ) est premier. 7. Si ( operatorname{ord}_q(p) = 1 ), alors ( p equiv 1 pmod{q} ). Mais cela signifie que ( q mid p - 1 ), et ( q ) ne peut pas être alors congru à 1 modulo ( p ), ce qui contredit notre recherche ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ). 8. Donc, l'autre possibilité est que ( operatorname{ord}_q(p) = p ). Cela implique que ( p ) divise ( q-1 ) donc : [ q equiv 1 pmod{p} ] Autrement dit, ( q = kp + 1 ) pour quelque entier ( k ). 9. Considérons maintenant le cas où la seule possibilité restante est que tous les diviseurs premiers de ( p^p - 1 ) divisent aussi ( p-1 ). 10. Alors, examinons le nombre ( 1 + p + p^2 + ldots + p^{p-1} = frac{p^p - 1}{p-1} ). Celui-ci est un diviseur de ( p^p - 1 ). 11. Si ( q mid frac{p^p - 1}{p-1} ), cela signifie que : [ 1 + p + p^2 + ldots + p^{p-1} equiv 0 pmod{q} ] 12. Mais en posant ( p equiv 1 pmod{q} ), nous trouvons que chaque terme de la somme de la série géométrique ci-dessus est congru à 1 modulo ( q ), donc la série devient ( p ) mod ( q ). 13. En particulier, ( 1 + p + p^2 + ldots + p^{p-1} equiv p pmod{q} ), ce qui constitue une contradiction car la somme doit être congru à 0 modulo ( q ). # Conclusion: Donc, ( q ) doit exister tel que ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ).

According to the problem, the point M lies on the parabola and its distance to the focus is equal to the distance from (3,0) to the directrix plus the distance from the focus to the vertex, which is equal to p.

Renu can complete the work in 6 days, which means her work rate is ( frac{1}{6} ) of the work per day. Renu and Suma together can complete the work in 3 days, which means their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{3} ) of the work per day. To find Suma's work rate, we subtract Renu's work rate from their combined work rate: Suma's work rate = Combined work rate - Renu's work rate Suma's work rate = ( frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{6} = frac{2}{6} - frac{1}{6} = frac{1}{6} ) of the work per day. So, Suma can complete the work alone in 6 days. Now, let's solve the second part of the problem to find out how long it would take all three of them to complete both tasks together. For the second piece of work: - Renu's work rate is ( frac{1}{9} ) of the work per day. - Suma's work rate is ( frac{1}{12} ) of the work per day. - Ravi's work rate is ( frac{1}{15} ) of the work per day. The combined work rate for the second piece of work is: ( frac{1}{9} + frac{1}{12} + frac{1}{15} ) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 180 (the least common multiple of 9, 12, and 15): ( frac{20}{180} + frac{15}{180} + frac{12}{180} = frac{47}{180} ) of the work per day. Now, we need to find out how long it would take them to complete both tasks together. Since the first task can be completed in 3 days by Renu and Suma, and we have already calculated the combined work rate for the second task, we can add these together: Total time to complete both tasks = Time for the first task + Time for the second task Total time = 3 days + (1 / combined work rate for the second task) Total time = 3 days + (1 / ( frac{47}{180} )) Total time = 3 days + ( frac{180}{47} ) days Total time = 3 days + approximately 3.83 days So, all three of them will complete both tasks together in approximately boxed{6.83} days."},{"prompt":"Let f(x) = frac{4}{3x}.

Analyze triangle ABC with I_{D} being the center of the inscribed circle for triangle ABD. Draw a line ell through point B parallel to side AC. The inscribed circle of triangle ABC is tangent to AC, so the point I_{D} lies strictly between AC and ell, as it touches AC but not ell. Therefore, points I_{D} and B are on opposite sides of the midpoint line ML. 3. Similarly, perform the analysis for other points: - Points I_{B} and I_{D} will lie on opposite sides of a plane, say MNKL. - Points I_{A} and I_{C} lie on the other side of this plane. 4. If I_{A}, I_{B}, I_{C}, I_{D} form a convex quadrilateral, then line segments I_{A}I_{C} and I_{B}I_{D} must intersect. However, from the analysis, points I_{B} and I_{D}, and points I_{A} and I_{C} are on opposite sides of the plane MNKL, thus their connecting segments cannot intersect. This is a contradiction. Case 2: One point lies inside the triangle formed by the other three: 1. Assume without loss of generality that I_{A} lies inside triangle I_{B}I_{C}I_{D}. 2. Since I_{B}, I_{C}, and I_{D} are the centers of the inscribed circles of the faces that do not contain vertex A, they must lie strictly on one side of the plane BCD while point I_{A} lies in the plane BCD itself. 3. Thus, I_{A} cannot lie inside the triangle I_{B}I_{C}I_{D} because of the spatial configuration implied by their relative positions wrt the plane of the tetrahedron faces. Since in both cases we reach a contradiction, the initial assumption that I_{A}, I_{B}, I_{C}, I_{D} can lie in the same plane must be false. Thus, the four centers of the inscribed circles in a tetrahedron cannot lie in the same plane.

What is the remainder when 100 is divided by k?","completion":"To solve this problem, we can approach it in two different ways, but both will lead us to the same conclusion. # Approach 1: Trial and Error with Perfect Squares 1. We are given that when 60 is divided by k^2, the remainder is 6. This implies that k^2 must be a divisor of a number slightly less than 60, specifically, it must divide 54 (since 60 - 6 = 54). 2. We look for perfect squares greater than 6 and less than 60, which are 3^2=9, 4^2=16, 5^2=25, 6^2=36, and 7^2=49. 3. Checking these perfect squares, we find that 60 div 9 = 6 remainder 6, which fits our condition. Therefore, k^2 = 9 and k = 3. 4. Knowing k=3, we then find the remainder when 100 is divided by 3. Since 99 is a multiple of 3, dividing 100 by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. # Approach 2: Algebraic Solution 1. We start with the equation ak^2 + 6 = 60, where a is a positive integer. This equation represents the division of 60 by k^2 leaving a remainder of 6. 2. Rearranging the equation gives us ak^2 = 54. We need to find k^2 that makes this equation true. 3. The prime factorization of 54 is 2 cdot 3^3. For ak^2 to equal 54, and knowing k^2 must be a perfect square, the only possibility is k^2 = 3^2 = 9. 4. Therefore, k = 3. With k found, we proceed to find the remainder when 100 is divided by 3. Since 99 is divisible by 3, dividing 100 by 3 leaves a remainder of 1. In both approaches, we conclude that the remainder when 100 is divided by k is boxed{1}."},{"prompt":"A train 140 m long is running at 60 kmph.

We will generalize this result to spheres of different radii. 3. **Homothety and Translation:** Suppose the spheres of radii ( r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n ) are denoted by ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_n ) respectively. We will use homothety (scaling) and translation to transform each sphere to a common sphere ( w_1 ). 4. **Transformation and Overlapping:** By applying a homothety or translation, we take each sphere to ( w_1 ). When two spheres merge, we delete the parts of them that overlap with each other. The key claim here is that when all the spheres are taken to ( w_1 ), there will be no lightened spot on the sphere, and any two dark spots formed by taking another sphere on it will never overlap. 5. **Proof of the Claim:** Consider two spheres ( w_i ) and ( w_j ) with ( i ne j ). We take both of them to ( w_1 ). This can be described as a transformation that takes ( w_i ) to ( w_j ) and then ( w_j ) to ( w_1 ). When ( w_i ) goes to ( w_j ), the lightened spot formed by themselves on their surface in both of them vanishes, and dark spots also do not overlap. This is true for any ( i, j ). 6. **Conclusion:** Since the transformation ensures that there are no overlapping lightened spots and the dark spots do not overlap, the total area of the dark spots on each sphere is preserved. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the dark spots on all spheres, normalized by the square of their radii, remains constant. 7. **Final Calculation:** The surface area of a sphere is ( 4 pi r^2 ). The area ( S_i ) is the area of the dark spots on the sphere ( w_i ). By the transformation, the sum of the normalized areas is: [ frac{S_1}{r_1^2} + frac{S_2}{r_2^2} + cdots + frac{S_n}{r_n^2} = 4 pi. ] The final answer is ( boxed{ 4 pi } )."},{"prompt":"Let alpha and beta be two different planes, and line m lies in plane alpha.

This is because, for m to be perpendicular to every line l in beta, alpha must intersect beta at a right angle, ensuring that m's perpendicularity to lines in beta is consistent. Therefore, the condition is sufficient for alpha to be perpendicular to beta. 2. **Necessity**: However, if alpha is perpendicular to beta, it does not necessarily mean that a specific line m in alpha is perpendicular to every line l in beta. When alpha is perpendicular to beta, a line m in alpha could intersect lines in beta at various angles or be parallel to some lines in beta, depending on m's orientation within alpha. Thus, the condition is not necessary for alpha to be perpendicular to beta. Given these considerations, the statement \\"for any line l inside plane beta, m is perpendicular to l\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"alpha is perpendicular to beta\\".

The gain is proportional to the product of the money invested and the time for which it is invested. So, we can write the gains as: Gain of Nandan = x * t Gain of Krishan = 4x * 3t = 12xt Since Nandan's earning was Rs. 2,000, we can write: x * t = Rs. 2,000 Now, we need to find the total gain in the business, which is the sum of the gains of Nandan and Krishan: Total gain = Gain of Nandan + Gain of Krishan Total gain = x * t + 12x * t Total gain = (1 + 12) * x * t Total gain = 13 * x * t We already know that x * t = Rs. 2,000, so we can substitute this into the equation: Total gain = 13 * Rs. 2,000 Total gain = Rs. 26,000 Therefore, the total gain in the business was Rs. boxed{26,000} ."},{"prompt":"Consider a parabola given by the equation y^{2}= frac {1}{4}x.

The sets in (mathscr{S}) are: 1. ({A_{i}, B_{i}, C_{i}}) for (1 leq i leq n). 2.

Find: the analytic expression of function g(x) when x∈mathbb{R}, and the value of m if the number of intersection points of y=g(x) and y=mx (m∈mathbb{R}) is 1001.","completion":"(1) From sin (x+a)=sin (-x), we get sin (x+a)=-sin x. According to the induction formula, we obtain a=2kπ+π (k∈mathbb{Z}). Hence, y=sin x has the \\"P(a) property\\" where a=2kπ+π (k∈mathbb{Z}). (2) Since y=f(x) has the \\"P(0) property\\", it follows that f(x)=f(-x). Let xgeqslant 0, then -xleqslant 0, and thus f(x)=f(-x)=(-x+t)^{2}=(x-t)^{2}. Therefore, f(x)= begin{cases} (x+t)^{2}, & xleqslant 0 (x-t)^{2}, & xgeqslant 0 end{cases} When tleqslant 0, since y=f(x) is increasing on [0,1], the maximum value of y is attained when x=1, i.e., y_{max}=(1-t)^{2}. When 0 < t < frac {1}{2}, y=f(x) is decreasing on [0,t] and increasing on [t,1], with f(0)=t^{2} < f(1)=(1-t)^{2}. Hence, the maximum value of y is attained when x=1, i.e., y_{max}=(1-t)^{2}. When tgeqslant frac {1}{2}, since y=f(x) is decreasing on [0,m] and increasing on [m,1], with f(0)=m^{2} geqslant f(1)=(1-m)^{2}, the maximum value of y is attained when x=0, i.e., y_{max}=t^{2}. In summary, when t < frac {1}{2}, y_{max}=f(1)=(1-t)^{2}; when tgeqslant frac {1}{2}, y_{max}=f(0)=t^{2}. (3) Since y=g(x) has the \\"P(±1) property\\", we have g(1+x)=g(-x) and g(-1+x)=g(-x). Thus, g(x+2)=g(1+1+x)=g(-1-x)=g(x), which implies that y=g(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2. For frac {1}{2}leqslant xleqslant frac {3}{2}, setting x-1 yields - frac {1}{2}leqslant x-1leqslant frac {1}{2}, and thus g(x)=g(x-2)=g(-1+x-1)=g(-x+1)=|-x+1|=|x-1|=g(x-1) Now, let n- frac {1}{2}leqslant xleqslant n+ frac {1}{2} (n∈mathbb{Z}). When n=2k (k∈mathbb{Z}), we have 2k- frac {1}{2}leqslant xleqslant 2k+ frac {1}{2}, so - frac {1}{2}leqslant x-2kleqslant frac {1}{2}, and g(x)=g(x-2k)=|x-2k|=|x-n| When n=2k+1 (k∈mathbb{Z}), we have 2k+1- frac {1}{2}leqslant xleqslant 2k+1+ frac {1}{2}, so frac {1}{2}leqslant x-2kleqslant frac {3}{2}, and g(x)=g(x-2k)=|x-2k-1|=|x-n| Thus, g(x)= begin{cases} -x+n, & n- frac {1}{2}leqslant xleqslant n x-n, & n < x < n+ frac {1}{2} end{cases} Hence, for n- frac {1}{2}leqslant xleqslant n+ frac {1}{2} (n∈mathbb{Z}), we have g(x)=|x-n|. Moreover, since n+1- frac {1}{2} < x+1 < n+1+ frac {1}{2}, it follows that g(x+1)=|(x+1)-(n+1)|=|x-n|=g(x). Therefore, y=g(x) is a periodic function with a period of 1. To find the value of m such that y=g(x) and y=mx have 1001 intersection points, we consider three cases: (i) When m > 0, we need y=mx to intersect y=g(x) 1000 times in [0,500) and once in [500,501]. Thus, boxed{m= frac {1}{1001}}. (ii) When m < 0, following a similar argument as in (i), we get boxed{m=- frac {1}{1001}}. (iii) When m=0, this does not meet the requirements of the problem.

(1) Find the monotonicity of f(x); (2) If the equation tf(x)x=0 has two distinct zeros in the interval [frac{1}{e}, 1) cup (1, e^2], find the range of values for t.","completion":"# Solution: Part (1): Monotonicity of f(x) Given the function f(x) = frac{x^2}{ln x}, we first determine its domain, which is (0,1) cup (1,+infty) due to the logarithm in the denominator. To find the monotonicity, we calculate the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{x^2}{ln x}right) = frac{x(2ln x - 1)}{(ln x)^2}. Next, we analyze the sign of f'(x) in different intervals of the domain: - For 0 < x < 1, ln x < 0 and 2ln x - 1 < -1, so f'(x) < 0. Thus, f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (0,1). - For 1 < x < sqrt{e}, 0 < ln x < frac{1}{2}, leading to 2ln x - 1 < 0, so f'(x) < 0. Hence, f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (1, sqrt{e}). - For x > sqrt{e}, ln x > frac{1}{2}, which implies 2ln x - 1 > 0, so f'(x) > 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (sqrt{e}, +infty). In summary, the function f(x) decreases monotonically in the intervals (0,1) and (1, sqrt{e}), and increases monotonically in the interval (sqrt{e}, +infty). Part (2): Range of Values for t For the equation tf(x) - x = 0 to have two distinct zeros in [frac{1}{e}, 1) cup (1, e^2], we consider the function g(x) = frac{ln x}{x}, which is the inverse of tf(x) for the given condition. The derivative of g(x) is: g'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2}. Analyzing the sign of g'(x): - For 0 < x < e, since 1 - ln x > 0, we have g'(x) > 0. Thus, g(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. - For x > e, 1 - ln x < 0, leading to g'(x) < 0. Hence, g(x) is monotonically decreasing for x > e. At x = e, g(x) reaches its maximum value, g(e) = frac{1}{e}. Additionally, we find the values of g(x) at critical points: - gleft(frac{1}{e}right) = -e, - g(e^2) = frac{2}{e^2}, - g(1) = 0. Therefore, for the graph of g(x) to intersect the line y = t at two different points within the given intervals, the range of t must be [frac{2}{e^2}, frac{1}{e}).

In the same state, a person is exempted from military service only if they are shorter than 80% (or more) of their neighbors. The definition of neighbors is similar; the person specifies a number r (radius), and so on, with R and r not necessarily being the same. Is it possible...","completion":"1. **Consider the initial setup**: We need to create a scenario in a theoretical state where a person can prove they are either eligible to join the police (if they are taller than 80% of their neighbors) or exempt from military service (if they are shorter than 80% of their neighbors). To do so, let's carefully establish the configuration. 2. **Define the individuals and their heights**: Imagine placing 10 individuals at points along a number line, incrementally closer together: ( x+1, x+3^{-1}, x+3^{-2}, ldots, x+3^{-9} ). Let their heights be ( a, a-0.1, a-0.2, ldots, a-0.9 ) respectively, where ( a > 1 ). 3. **Neighbors and their determination**: The radius ( R ) for determining police eligibility is chosen by each person. Let's say the radii chosen by the first nine individuals are ( -1, 3^{-1}, 3^{-2}, ldots, 3^{-8} ). 4. **Analysis of police eligibility in the given configuration**: Given these choices of R: - The first person will consider everyone from person 2 to 10 as their neighbors. - The second person will consider everyone from person 3 to 10 as their neighbors, and so on. Therefore, each of the first nine individuals will have at least nine neighbors and will be taller than all their neighbors. The tenth person will only have one neighbor and hence cannot meet the 80% criteria. 5. **Definition of a basic configuration**: We call such a setup (the positions on the number line and corresponding heights) a \\"basic configuration\\". 6. **Expanding to a larger population (e.g., 1000 individuals)**: Construct a state with 1000 individuals distributed in 100 basic configurations ( B_0, B_1, ldots, B_{99} ) with parameters ( x_i = 3^{99-i}, a = 100 + i ). 7. **Analyzing the general state**: In this broader layout: - Individuals in separate basic configurations won't interfere with each other. - Each configuration remains self-contained, allowing the first nine out of 10 in each basic configuration to potentially qualify for police eligibility since they are taller than their immediate neighbors. 8. **Determination of military exemption**: For military exemption, the radius ( r ) chosen must be smaller than that for police eligibility. Let each person choose ( r = 3^{99-i} ). 9. **Calculating the percentage for military exemption**: Each person in a given basic configuration will have their nine fellow members as neighbors. Thus, with eight of these being taller, this means that for ( i < 96 ), there are at least 40 taller individuals when all configurations are considered. Consequently, having 40 taller neighbors out of a total of 49 results in those 9 shorter neighbors representing less than 20%. 10. **Final analysis and conclusion**: Thus individuals in these primary setups satisfy both conditions. Specifically, 960 individuals qualify for either service area, representing more than 90% of the state's population. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it is proven that the configurations and choices of radii can indeed allow individuals to manipulate their eligibility either for police service or military exemption based on their neighbors' heights.
