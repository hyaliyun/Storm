Solution: # Step 1: Define the number Let the four-digit number be ( x ), which can be expressed as ( overline{abcd} ) where ( a, b, c, d ) are its digits. # Step 2: Analyze the conditions - From Condition (1), ( 15 mid x + 1 ), meaning ( x + 1 ) is a multiple of 15. Thus, the last digit ( d ) must be either 4 or 9 (since adding 1 to a number ending in 4 or 9 gives a number ending in 5 or 0 respectively, which are multiples of 15). - From Condition (2), ( 38 mid x - 3 ), meaning ( x - 3 ) is a multiple of 38. Therefore, ( x ) must be an odd number (since ( x - 3 ) must be even). Combining these two results, since ( x ) must be odd, ( d ) must be 9 (since 4 is even). # Step 3: Determine the digit ( a ) - From Condition (3): ( 10 mid overline{abcd} + overline{dcba} ), meaning the sum of the number and its reverse is a multiple of 10.

Consider a right triangle with its right angle at point P(a,b), and the other two vertices at Q(a,b+2c) and R(a-2d,b). The midpoints of the legs opposite to P would then be at (a,b+c) and (a-d,b), respectively.

Similarly, the slope of the median to the midpoint of the leg along the x-axis is frac{2c}{d}. It's clear that frac{2c}{d} = 4left(frac{c}{2d}right), indicating that one median's slope is 4 times the other. Given the problem states the slopes of the medians are on the lines y = 3x + 1 and y = mx + 2, we can deduce that m must be either 4 times 3 or frac{1}{4} of 3. This gives us m = 12 or m = frac{3}{4}. To verify that both values of m are possible, consider a triangle with a hypotenuse slope of frac{12}{2} = 6.

By translating this triangle so that its medians intersect at the point where y = 12x + 2 and y = 3x + 1 intersect, we ensure the medians lie on these lines.

Furthermore, any central dilation of this triangle (scaling it up or down while keeping the same centroid and orientation) will preserve the slopes of the medians, thus allowing for infinitely many such triangles.

To show the equality case, we assume (a = b = c = 2). 1. **Reformulation with Lemma**: We swap the role of the constraint and the inequality to prove the lemma first: **Lemma:** Given positive real numbers (A, B), and (C) satisfying ((A + 1)(B + 1)(C + 1) = 27), prove: A + B + C + 2 geq ABC. Equality holds when (A = B = C = 2). 2. **Implication of Lemma**: From the lemma, the equality case yields (a = b = c = 2). Suppose, for positive real numbers with (a + b + c + 2 = abc), we have ((a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) < 27). To reach a contradiction, increase (a) until ((a^prime + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) = 27).

This contradicts the lemma, proving our original inequality. 3. **Proof of Lemma**: Let (x = A + 1), (y = B + 1), (z = C + 1). Then, the constraint becomes (xyz = 27). The inequality to be proven transforms to: (x-1) + (y-1) + (z-1) + 2 geq (x-1)(y-1)(z-1). Rewriting, we get: x + y + z - 1 geq (x-1)(y-1)(z-1). By expansion and simplification: [ x + y + z = 3 + (x-1) + (y-1) + (z-1) implies (x-1) + (y-1) + (z-1) + 3 geq (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) ] This means, our original inequality (x y + x z + y z geq xyz) transforms to: [ x + y + z geq (x-1)(y-1)(z-1). ] Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality: frac{(xy + xz + yz)}{3} geq sqrt[3]{(xyz)^2} = sqrt[3]{27^2} = 9. Simplifying, we get: frac{xy + xz + yz}{3} geq 9 implies xy + xz + yz geq 27 . Since (xyz = 27), xy + xz + yz geq xyz. Therefore, equality holds when (xy = xz = yz), which implies (x = y = z). Given (xyz = 27), we have: x^3 = 27 implies x = y = z = 3. This corresponds to (A = B = C = 2). **Conclusion**: Therefore, the result follows, and the original inequality ((a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) geq 27) holds true with equality when (a = b = c = 2).

This gives us that 2^n and f(2^n - f(y)) + y have the same number of 1's in their binary representation. Since 2^n has exactly one 1, f(2^n - f(y)) + y must also have exactly one 1.

By Claim 1, f(2^n - f(y)) = 2^t - y > 0 for some t with t geq k + 1. Therefore, P(2^n - f(y), y + 2^k) gives: [ d(2^n - f(y) + f(y + 2^k)) = d(2^t + 2^k) = 2 ] since t geq k + 1. If f(y) = f(y + 2^k), then the left-hand side is d(2^n) = 1, which is a contradiction. If f(y) > f(y + 2^k), and f(y) - f(y + 2^k) has m < log_2(10 + |f(y + 2^k) - f(y)|) digits, then: [ d(2^n - f(y) + f(y + 2^k)) geq n - m - 1 geq 999 > 2 ] since 2^n - f(y) + f(y + 2^k) starts with at least n - m - 1 ones, which is a contradiction. Therefore, f(y + 2^k) > f(y), and since n is bigger than the number of digits in f(y + 2^k) - f(y), there is no carry-over, so: [ 2 = d(2^n - f(y) + f(y + 2^k)) = 1 + d(f(y + 2^k) - f(y)) ] which gives us that f(y + 2^k) - f(y) is a power of two, as required. blacksquare 5. **Derive the form of f(y):** Claim 2 gives us f(y + 1) - f(y) = 2^{t(y)} for some t(y), for all y. But for y geq 2, f(y + 2) - f(y) is also a power of two, implying that 2^{t(y)} + 2^{t(y + 1)} is a power of two, which is only possible if t(y) = t(y + 1) for all y geq 2. Therefore, f(y + 1) - f(y) is a constant power of two for all y geq 2, say 2^k. This gives us f(y) = 2^k y + c for some constant c, for all y geq 2. 6. **Verify the solution:** Putting this in Claim 1, we get: [ 2^{k+n} - (2^{2k} - 1)y - (2^k - 1)c ] is a power of two for any y geq 2 and any sufficiently large n. This is only possible if, for all y geq 2, [ (2^{2k} - 1)y + (2^k - 1)c = 0 ] which implies: [ (2^k - 1)((2^k + 1)y + c) = 0 ] This can only hold for all y geq 2 if 2^k = 1, i.e., f(y) = y + c for all y geq 2. But Claim 1 for y = 1 and large n gives: [ 2^n - f(1) + 1 + c ] is a power of two for all sufficiently large n, which is only possible if f(1) = 1 + c.

Let line l pass through P, exclusive of the line through P and Q. - Likewise, point Q must be an intersection of at least two lines. Let line m pass through Q, exclusive of the line through P and Q. - For lines l and m to intersect only twice, they must be parallel to avoid a third intersection. - We now add the line n passing through both P and Q. 4. **Attempt to Draw Fourth Line:** - If we draw another line through P, it must intersect line m if they are not parallel, creating a third intersection. - Similarly, drawing another line through Q that is not parallel to l would also create a third intersection point. 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, it’s impossible to draw four straight lines with only two points of intersection.

We start by calculating F(n) for a few small values of n: - For n = 1: [ F(1) = 1 ] (The possible integer is 0) - For n = 2: [ F(2) = 4 ] (The possible integers are 0, 01, 1, 10) - For n = 3: [ F(3) = 11 ] (The possible integers are 0, 01, 012, 1, 10, 102, 12, 120, 2, 21, 210) - For n = 4: [ F(4) = 26 ] (The possible integers are 0, 01, 012, 0123, 1, 10, 102, 1023, 12, 120, 1203, 123, 1230, 2, 21, 210, 2103, 213, 2130, 23, 231, 2310, 3, 32, 321, 3210) 4. To generalize the pattern, consider the digit conditions. The rightmost digit can either be the largest or smallest digit used. 5. For convenience, assume M has m digits where 1 < m leq n. Let k_i = min{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m} and k_j = max{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m} such that i < j leq m. 6. By the problem condition, all intermediate digits between k_i and k_j must exist. This ensures there are no gaps between the minimum and maximum digits. 7. The total number of valid numbers in base (n+1) satisfying conditions can be divided into three categories: - Single digit numbers: 0, 1, 2, ..., n contributing n+1 numbers. - Numbers derived from F(n) with an additional digit n: Extend each M in F(n) by adding n at the end. - Numbers derived from F(n) with digits increased by 1: Adjust existing numbers where each digit increases by one, and then append the smallest original digit at the end. 8.

We apply this theorem to the ( nk ) piles to obtain ( n ) piles such that the corresponding ( a_i ) sum to ( 0 mod n ). This is possible as long as ( k ge 2 ). 6. **Recombining Black Cards:** - Recombine the black ( 1 )'s into ( n )'s to get a legitimate collection of cards summing to ( n! ).

Therefore, [ angle EFK = angle ECK = angle EDA = angle EFG ] - This also implies that F, J, K are concyclic. 6. **Analyzing the Bisector Properties**: - Since E is the excenter opposite to vertex A of triangle BAC, line EA bisects angle KAJ.

The sum of the squares of the first (3k) numbers is: [ sum_{i=1}^{3k} i^2 = frac{(3k)(3k+1)(6k+1)}{6} ] This expression is divisible by 3 if (k) is a multiple of 3. 7. **Conclusion**: Since (k = 3) does not have a construction, the smallest (k) for which a construction exists is (k = 6). Therefore, (k) must be of the form (3n) with (n geq 2).

This means it repeats every 1 digit. Given these repeating patterns, we can infer that the sum of these two fractions will have a repeating pattern that can accommodate both original patterns. Since the first pattern repeats every 6 digits and the second repeats every 1 digit, the sum's repeating pattern will also repeat every 6 digits, as 6 is a multiple of both 1 and 6.

There are 8 other stops besides ( A ). Each route passing through ( A ) also includes two other stops. 3. **Conditions of Routes**: Since no two routes can share a stop (other than ( A )), the stops paired with ( A ) must be unique for each route. Hence, the number of different routes passing through ( A ) is limited by how many ways we can select 2 stops out of the remaining 8 stops. This number is given by the combination ( binom{8}{2} ): [ binom{8}{2} = frac{8 cdot 7}{2 cdot 1} = 28 ] However, since each of these routes can only appear once to avoid shared stops outside of ( A ), calculating directly this way isn't valid as we will have overcounts. 4. **Ratio Consideration**: Each route passing through ( A ) can pair with exactly 2 additional stops from the remaining ( 8 ) stops.

Given that the sum of the binomial coefficients in the expansion of {(5x-frac{3}{sqrt{x}})}^{n} is 64, we can set up the equation 2^n = 64.

Now, to check if 2, 6, 10 form an arithmetic sequence, we need to verify if the common difference is the same between consecutive terms. The difference between 6 and 2 is 4, and the difference between 10 and 6 is also 4. Since the common difference is consistent, 2, 6, 10 indeed form an arithmetic sequence.

The term with the largest binomial coefficient in a binomial expansion is always the middle term if n is odd, which in this case, would be the 4th term (since there are 7 terms, and the middle position is frac{7+1}{2} = 4).

Senya and Zhenya wrote down n1 digits each in their notebooks, reading them clockwise. It turned out that although they started at different points, the n1digit numbers they recorded were identical. Prove that the circle can be divided into several arcs so that the digits on the arcs form identical numbers.","completion":"1. Suppose that Senya and Zhenya have written identical (n-1)-digit numbers despite starting at different points on the circle. Let us denote the numbers listed on the circle by a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n. 2. Since Senya and Zhenya have recorded the same sequence of (n-1) digits, this sequence must include the same digits with the same frequencies. Thus, every digit from 1 to 9 must appear the same number of times in both sequences they wrote down. 3. Let the digit (a_i) be the digit not included in Senya’s sequence. Similarly, let (a_j) be the digit not included in Zhenya’s sequence. Because the frequency of each digit other than these two is the same in their sequences, the digits (a_i) and (a_j) must be the same. Therefore, (a_i = a_j). 4. Consider any starting point (k) around the circle, with (0 leq k leq n-1). When Senya starts from this point, she would disregard a digit (a_{k+1}) after encircling the circle. Similarly, Zhenya starts from some different point and also disregards one digit after encircling the circle. Thus, if their sequences match despite different starting points, it implies a rotational symmetry in the arrangement of digits around the circle. 5. We can infer that rotating the circle by (k) digits along the clockwise direction should map the circle onto itself such that every digit maps to a digit equal to it. Hence, there exists (m) (the smallest number (m)) such that if the circle is rotated by (m) positions, every digit aligns with an equal one, showing the same sequence. Mathematically, we seek the smallest (m geq 1) such that: [ a_i = a_{(i+m) mod n} text{ for all } i in {1, 2, ldots, n} ] 6. If (m) is the minimal non-zero number such that rotating by (m) aligns the sequence, we can divide the circle into (n/m) arcs, each containing (m) digits. Because (m) is the smallest non-zero such number, (n) must be divisible by (m). 7. Let's confirm ( r ) by dividing ( n ) by ( m ): [ n = m cdot q + r quad text{with } 0 leq r < m ] Should rotating by (r) also map the circle onto itself, we realize it can't (as (r < m)) unless (r = 0). Thus (r) must be zero, and (m) divides (n). 8. Consequently, if (m) divides (n), then (n = k cdot m) for some integer (k). The circle can thus be divided into (k) arcs with (m) digits each, such that rotating by multiples of (m) maps the entire circle onto itself. 9. Each of these (k) segments contains the same sequence of (m) digits. Thus, the digit sequences on the arcs formed after each division are identical. # Conclusion: Given the above reasoning and step-by-step justification, we have proved that the circle can indeed be divided into several arcs, each containing (m) digits, where the digits on each arc form identical sequences.

Define ( P_{i} ) as one of the ( n ) points on the ellipse given by the equation: [ frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 quad (a > b) ] 2. The equation of the line is: [ x = -frac{a^2}{c} ] where ( c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} ). 3. Let ( d_i ) represent the distance from point ( P_i ) to the line ( x = -frac{a^2}{c} ). Define the angles ( alpha = frac{2pi}{n} ) and ( beta = angle P_1 F O ). 4. By the second definition of an ellipse, we know: [ |P_i F| = frac{c}{a} d_i ] where ( F ) is the left focus. Using this definition, we can write: [ d_i = left( frac{a^2}{c} - c right) + |P_i F| cos [(i-1)alpha + beta] ] 5. Substitute ( |P_i F| ) from the definition: [ d_i = frac{a^2 - c^2}{c} + frac{c}{a} d_i cdot cos [(i-1)alpha + beta] ] Simplifying, we get: [ d_i = frac{b^2}{c} + frac{c}{a} d_i cdot cos [(i-1)alpha + beta] ] 6.

To evaluate the summation term: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} cos [(i-1) alpha + beta] ] 10. Using the trigonometric identity for the sum of cosines: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} cos left([i-1] alpha + betaright) = -sin left(frac{alpha}{2} + betaright) + sin left[frac{(2n-1)alpha}{2} + beta right] ] Because ( alpha = frac{2pi}{n} ), it follows that: [ 2 cos [(n-1)alpha + beta] sin nalpha = 0 ] 11. Thus, the sum of the cosines is zero: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} cos [(i-1) alpha + beta] = 0 ] 12. Finally, substituting this back into our equation: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{d_i} = frac{nc}{b^2} ] 13.

The total number of people that went to the swim meet is the sum of the people in the cars and the people in the vans, which is ( 2x + 9 ). We also know that they could have taken 17 more people with the swim team. This means that the total capacity of the cars and vans combined is 17 more than the number of people that actually went.

The maximum capacity of each van is 8 people, so the total capacity of the 3 vans is ( 3 times 8 = 24 ) people. The total maximum capacity of the cars and vans combined is ( 12 + 24 = 36 ) people.

We consider n integers x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n} such that their sum is 2016.

This means that P(0) = 0, which directly implies that e = 0. Let's denote the other x-intercepts as p, q, r, and s. Therefore, we can express P(x) as: [P(x) = x(x - p)(x - q)(x - r)(x - s).] From this factorization, we can observe that the constant term e is indeed 0, as shown by the presence of the x term outside the parentheses. This confirms our initial deduction. Now, focusing on the coefficient d, which is the product of the roots taken four at a time (since it's the coefficient of the x term), we find that: [d = pqrs.] Given that p, q, r, and s are the x-intercepts and are all distinct, none of them can be zero (since we already have the intercept at (0,0)). This means that p, q, r, and s are all nonzero values, leading to the conclusion that d (being the product of these nonzero values) must also be nonzero. Therefore, the coefficient that cannot be zero is d. Hence, the answer is boxed{text{(D)}}. To further illustrate that any of the other coefficients can be zero, consider the examples provided: 1.

Given the quadrilateral AKBM is cyclic (inscribed in a circle), the sum of its opposite angles is 180^circ. Specifically, angle KAM + angle KBM = 180^circ. 4.

The winner received 1054 votes, which is 408 more than the number of votes the other candidate received. Therefore, the other candidate received 1054 - 408 = 646 votes. The total number of votes cast, V, is the sum of the votes for both candidates: V = 1054 (winner's votes) + 646 (other candidate's votes) V = 1700 votes The percentage of votes the winner received is calculated by dividing the number of votes the winner received by the total number of votes cast and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage: Percentage of votes for the winner = (1054 / 1700) * 100 Now, let's calculate the percentage: Percentage of votes for the winner = (1054 / 1700) * 100 Percentage of votes for the winner ≈ 61.94% Therefore, the winner received approximately boxed{61.94%} of the votes."},{"prompt":"During the MidAutumn Festival, Xiaohua's mother bought a Hami melon.

Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - A \\"2-line\\" is the area between two parallel lines. - The length of a \\"2-line\\" is the distance between the two parallel lines. - We need to cover a unit circle (a circle with radius 1) with some \\"2-lines\\" and prove that the sum of the lengths of these \\"2-lines\\" is at least 2. 2. **Geometric Interpretation:** - Consider a unit circle centered at the origin. - Any \\"2-line\\" covering the circle must have a width (distance between the parallel lines) that is at least the diameter of the circle in some direction. - The diameter of the unit circle is 2. 3. **Covering the Circle:** - To cover the entire unit circle, we need to ensure that every point on the circle is within at least one \\"2-line\\". - If we use multiple \\"2-lines\\" to cover the circle, each \\"2-line\\" must have a width that contributes to covering the circle. 4. **Summing the Lengths:** - Let ( w_1, w_2, ldots, w_n ) be the widths of the \\"2-lines\\" used to cover the unit circle. - The sum of these widths must be at least the diameter of the circle in every direction. - Since the circle is symmetric, the total sum of the widths must cover the entire circle. 5. **Mathematical Argument:** - Consider the projection of the unit circle onto a line perpendicular to the direction of each \\"2-line\\". - The projection of the unit circle onto any line is an interval of length 2 (the diameter of the circle). - Therefore, the sum of the widths of the \\"2-lines\\" must be at least 2 to cover the entire projection of the circle. 6. **Conclusion:** - Since the sum of the widths of the \\"2-lines\\" must cover the entire projection of the circle, and the projection has a length of 2, the sum of the widths of the \\"2-lines\\" must be at least 2.

Each domino contains two squares. - The strategy for the first player (starting player) is to always make a move to the other square of the 2 times 1 domino containing the dark king. By following this strategy: - After the first player's move, each 2 times 1 rectangle is either fully occupied (both squares have been visited by the king) or entirely unvisited. - The second player is then forced to move to an unvisited 2 times 1 domino. - The first player moves back to the other square of the same domino on their turn. This guarantees that the first player always has a move available, and the second player eventually runs out of moves because the board is finite. Therefore, the first player (starting player) has a winning strategy. 2. **Case 2:** Both m and n are odd - In this case, divide the chessboard (excluding the initial square where the king starts) into 2 times 1 and 1 times 2 rectangles (dominoes). - Specifically: - The remaining (n-1) squares of the first row can be divided into 1 times 2 rectangles. - The remaining (m-1) times n squares can be divided into 2 times 1 rectangles. - The second player can follow the same strategy used in Case 1: - The second player moves to the other square within the Domino containing the dark king after the first player's move. By following this strategy: - The second player ensures that after their moves each 2 times 1 or 1 times 2 rectangle is either fully occupied or unvisited. - The first player will always find themselves forced to move to a yet unseen domino, ensuring that the second player eventually has a move leading to the first player running out of available moves.

It is well-known that in any tetrahedron, medians intersect at the centroid, and each median divides the tetrahedron in the ratio (3:1). 3. **Determination of the Division by Planes:** - Since each plane passes through (S), it implies that each plane also includes two medians of the tetrahedron. - Considering a plane passing through edge (AC) and midpoint of opposite edge, let's denote it as the plane (ACS). 4. **Analyzing Tetrahedron Subdivision:** - Analyze the tetrahedron (BCD S). The faces of this sub-tetrahedron intersect with the planes (B C S), (C D S), (B D S). - These planes divide the (BCD) triangle into six equal-area parts because the medians of a triangle divide it into six smaller triangles of equal area. 5. **Volume Calculation and Fractional Division:** - From the earlier subdivision of triangles into equal areas, the tetrahedron (BCD S) is divided into six equal volume parts. - The volume of the tetrahedron (BCD S) is a quarter of the volume of the original tetrahedron (ABCD) because the centroid (S) is a quarter of the distance from the face (BCD) compared to vertex (A). 6. **Final Volume Comparison and Total Partition:** - Similar arguments apply to the other sub-tetrahedra (ABC S, ABD S, ACD S). - Thus each of these tetrahedra is split into 6 equal volume parts by their intersecting planes.

Since b=aq^{m+1}, b_{n}=aq^{n}, d= frac {b-a}{m+1}, thus d > frac {bn-a}{n}, meaning a+nd > b_{n}, hence a_{n} > b_{n}. ② When b < a, 0 < q < 1, when n in N^{*}, n leqslant m, frac {Sm+1}{m+1} < frac {Sn}{n}.

Consider the factorization: [ f(-1) = 1 - b - c + bc = (1 - b)(1 - c) ] - Since (-1 < b < 1) and (-1 < c < 1), both (1 - b) and (1 - c) are positive: [ (1 - b) > 0 quad text{and} quad (1 - c) > 0 ] - The product of two positive numbers is positive: [ (1 - b)(1 - c) > 0 ] - Hence: [ f(-1) > 0 ] - Since (f(a)) is increasing for (b+c geq 0), (f(a) geq f(-1)) for (-1 < a < 1) ensuring (f(a) > 0). 2. **When (b+c < 0)**: - In this case, (f(a)) is a decreasing function since the coefficient of (a), which is (b + c), is negative. - Therefore, the minimum value of (f(a)) will occur when (a = 1): [ f(1) = (b+c)(1) + bc + 1 = b + c + bc + 1 ] - Similarly, we need to show that this expression is positive.

We will analyze each case: - **Case 1**: If (a) is erased: [ abcd + bcd = abcd + bcd quad text{(units digit is } d + d = 2d text{, which is even)} ] Since 6031 has an odd units digit, (a) cannot be erased. - **Case 2**: If (b) is erased: [ abcd + acd = abcd + acd quad text{(units digit is } d + d = 2d text{, which is even)} ] Again, since 6031 has an odd units digit, (b) cannot be erased. - **Case 3**: If (c) is erased: [ abcd + abd = abcd + abd quad text{(units digit is } d + d = 2d text{, which is even)} ] Therefore, (c) also cannot be erased. - **Case 4**: If (d) is erased: [ abcd + abc quad text{(units digit is } d + 0 text{ remains unpredictable}) ] This case cannot be directly ruled out and needs further checking. 4. **Formulating the Equation**: Let the erased digit be (d): [ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d + 100a + 10b + c = 6031 ] Simplify the equation: [ 1100a + 110b + 11c + d = 6031 ] 5. **Solving for the Digits**: We look for digits (a), (b), (c), and (d) satisfying the above equation: Considering carryovers and digit ranges: - Thousands column: [ a + 1 = 6 Rightarrow a = 5 ] - Hundreds column: [ b + 5 + text{carry from tens} = 10 Rightarrow text{carry from } text{tens} = 1, quad b + 6 = 10 Rightarrow b = 4 ] - Tens column: [ c + 4 + 1 = 13 Rightarrow c = 8 ] - Units column checks units sum: [ d + 9(text{and 1 carry}) = 11 Rightarrow d = 3 ] 6. **Verification**: The digits are (a = 5), (b = 4), (c = 8), and (d = 3). Sum of digits: [ 5 + 4 + 8 + 3 = 20 ] Verifying equation: [ 5483 + 548 = 5483 + 548 = 6031 ] **Conclusion**: [ boxed{20} ]"},{"prompt":"On the Island of Knights and Knaves, knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.

Therefore, point ( M ) lies on the plane which is equidistant from points ( A ) and ( C ). This plane is the diagonal plane ( B B_{1} D_{1} D ). 2. Similarly, (B_{1} C_{1}) and (C_{1} D_{1}) are also on the sphere, making ( M ) also a point on the plane equidistant from ( B_{1} C_{1} ) and ( C_{1} D_{1} ). This plane is the diagonal plane (A A_{1} C_{1} C ). 3. Hence, ( M ) is located at the intersection of the diagonal planes ( (A C C_{1} C) ) and ( (B B_{1} D_{1} D) ). 4. **Finding the Intersection Point:** Since (M) lies on the line ( A C ), it also belongs to the plane passing through the midpoints of ( B_{1} C_{1} ) and (C_{1} D_{1}), calculated as (E_{1}). Let's denote the midpoint of ( B_{1} C_{1} ) as ( F_{1} ) and the midpoint of (C_{1} D_{1}) as ( E_{1} ).

We need to show that this path ( p ) can be traversed in at most (frac{1}{2}(n^2-1)) moves. 3. **Bounding the Path Length:** - **Claim:** In any row or column, there are at most ( n-1 ) squares in ( p ). - **Proof:** - If there were ( n ) squares in a row or column, then ( p ) would include all squares in that row or column. - **Case 1:** If ( p ) enters the row/column, visits all squares, and then leaves, it must enter at one end. We could then shorten ( p ) by moving diagonally to the next square, contradicting the assumption that ( p ) is the shortest path. - **Case 2:** If ( p ) enters and leaves the row/column multiple times, there must be two adjacent squares where ( p ) leaves and re-enters. We could then shorten ( p ) by moving directly between these two squares, again contradicting the shortest path assumption. - Therefore, ( p ) can have at most ( n-1 ) squares in any row or column. 4. **Adjacent Rows and Columns:** - **Claim:** ( p ) has at most ( n ) squares in any two adjacent rows or columns. - **Proof:** - Consider two adjacent rows ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ). Each column can contribute at most one square from ( r_1 cup r_2 ) to ( p ), or else ( p ) can be shortened. - The only exception is when ( p ) visits only one column, in which case it can visit both squares in that column. - After ( p ) leaves and re-enters, it cannot visit any column adjacent to already visited columns without shortening ( p ). - Thus, ( p ) can visit at most ( n ) squares in any two adjacent rows or columns. 5. **Combining the Insights:** - Consider the first (frac{n-1}{2}) pairs of adjacent rows/columns and the last row/column. - The total number of squares in ( p ) is at most: [ frac{n-1}{2} cdot n + (n-1) = frac{n^2+n-1}{2} ] - Therefore, the number of moves required is at most: [ frac{n^2+n-3}{2} ] 6. **Conclusion:** Since (frac{n^2+n-3}{2} leq frac{1}{2}(n^2-1)) for all odd ( n ), the king can always travel between any two green squares in at most (frac{1}{2}(n^2-1)) moves.

Hence, larger numbers will eventually reduce in value when transformed to their digitlength. 2. **Sequence Decreases Until Single Digit is Reached**: Given that the digitlength always reduces the value of a number with at least two digits, it's evident that repeated application of digitlength transformation ensures that the sequence of numbers we obtain is strictly decreasing, provided the number has two or more digits. Since a sequence of positive integers cannot decrease infinitely, we must eventually reach a single-digit number. 3. **Behavior of Single-Digit Numbers**: When we reach a single-digit number, the possible digitlengths are: - ( 1 ) (one) has ( 3 ) letters. - ( 2 ) (two) has ( 3 ) letters. - ( 3 ) (three) has ( 5 ) letters. - ( 4 ) (four) has ( 4 ) letters. - ( 5 ) (five) has ( 4 ) letters. - ( 6 ) (six) has ( 3 ) letters. - ( 7 ) (seven) has ( 5 ) letters. - ( 8 ) (eight) has ( 5 ) letters. - ( 9 ) (nine) has ( 4 ) letters. Once we encounter a single-digit number, we then consider the digitlength of that number. Analyzing the transformations, we find: - ( 1 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 5 rightarrow 4 ) - ( 2 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 5 rightarrow 4 ) - ( 3 rightarrow 5 rightarrow 4 ) - ( 4 rightarrow 4 ) - ( 5 rightarrow 4 ) - ( 6 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 5 rightarrow 4 ) - ( 7 rightarrow 5 rightarrow 4 ) - ( 8 rightarrow 5 rightarrow 4 ) - ( 9 rightarrow 4 ) 4. **Conclusion**: This shows that any positive integer will ultimately map to ( 4 ) via repeated digitlength transformations.

For any given plane in the cube that contains four vertices, there are two vertices not on the plane that can form lines perpendicular to this plane. Since a cube has 6 faces and each face can be considered such a plane, there are 6 times 2 = 12 lines perpendicular to these planes. 2. Each of these lines is counted for two planes (since each line is perpendicular to two opposite faces), so the actual number of unique \\"perpendicular line-plane pairs\\" is frac{12}{2} = 6. 3. However, considering the symmetry of the cube, each vertex can serve as the starting point for such a perpendicular line. Since there are 8 vertices in a cube, we multiply the 6 unique pairs by 8. Therefore, the total number of \\"perpendicular line-plane pairs\\" in a cube is 6 times 8 = 48. However, this calculation includes an error in considering the symmetry and the unique pairs, as it mistakenly counts each line twice and overlooks the correct method of pairing lines with planes. The correct approach is to observe that each of the 12 edges of the cube can serve as a perpendicular line to one of the two faces (planes) it is connected to, but not in the manner described above. Correctly pairing these requires a different approach, focusing on the geometric properties and relationships within the cube. Upon reevaluation, considering each edge of the cube as a potential line and the adjacent faces as potential planes, and correctly accounting for the unique perpendicular relationships, the actual number of \\"perpendicular line-plane pairs\\" is determined by the cube's geometry, not the erroneous multiplication of faces and vertices.

Since ( 6k^2 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{6} ), it is possible for ( 6k^2 + 1 ) to be a perfect square. 4. **Verification:** - Let’s verify if ( 6k^2 + 1 ) can indeed be a perfect square. Suppose ( 6k^2 + 1 = m^2 ) for some integer ( m ): [ m^2 - 6k^2 = 1 ] - This is a form of the Pell's equation ( x^2 - 6y^2 = 1 ), which has infinitely many solutions in integers ( (m, k) ). 5. **Conclusion:** - Since there are infinitely many solutions to the Pell's equation, there are infinitely many values of ( k ) such that ( 6k^2 + 1 ) is a perfect square. - Therefore, there are infinitely many starting numbers ( n = 3k^2 - 1 ) that lead to Anton's win.

Here are the steps: 1. **Numbering the Vertices:** Number the vertices of the regular n-gon from 0 to n-1 in order. 2. **Assigning Cosine Values:** Assign the number cosleft(frac{k pi}{n} + alpharight) to the k-th vertex (k=0,1,2, ldots, n-1), where alpha is chosen such that none of these cosine values is zero. 3. **Why these numbers work:** - These numbers are projections of vectors from the center of the n-gon to its vertices onto some axis that passes through the center. 4. **Sum for any k-gon:** Consider any subset of vertices forming a k-polygon, where k leq n. Our goal is to show that the sum of the numbers assigned to these vertices is zero. 5. **Working within a regular n-gon:** Observe that a regular n-gon can be inscribed within a unit circle (a circle centered at the origin with radius 1). The vertices of this n-gon are on the circumference of the circle. 6. **Projections for any k-gon:** When considering a k-gon that is part of this n-gon (another inscribed regular polygon with k sides), the vertices of this k-gon also lie on the unit circle. Set the vertices to be frac{2 pi j}{k} for j=0,1,2, ldots, k-1 which are evenly spaced on the circle. Therefore, these vertices correspond to cosleft(frac{2 pi j}{k} + alpharight). 7. **Calculating Sum of Projections:** Note that the total projection of the vertices of a regular polygon along any diameter of the circle is zero because these projections are symmetrically distributed around the center. For the vertices frac{2 pi j}{k}: [ sum_{j=0}^{k-1} cosleft(frac{2 pi j}{k} + alpha right) = cos(alpha) sum_{j=0}^{k-1} cosleft(frac{2 pi j}{k} right) - sin(alpha) sum_{j=0}^{k-1} sinleft(frac{2 pi j}{k} right) ] 8. **Applying Sum Identities:** Using the fact that the sum of cosines and sines of equally spaced arguments over a full circle (or segment of it in evenly spaced form) are both zero: [ sum_{j=0}^{k-1} cosleft(frac{2 pi j}{k}right) = 0,quad sum_{j=0}^{k-1} sinleft(frac{2 pi j}{k}right) = 0 ] 9. **Resulting Zero Sum:** Combining these results, it follows that: [ sum_{j=0}^{k-1} cosleft(frac{2 pi j}{k} + alpha right) = cos(alpha) cdot 0 - sin(alpha) cdot 0 = 0 ] Thus, for any k-subset of vertices in the n-gon, the sum of the assigned numbers is zero.

Let's verify this relationship by induction: - Base Case: [ P_0 = 1, quad Q_1 = pQ_0 - qQ_{-1} = p ] - Inductive Step: Assume true for ( k ): [ P_k = Q_{k+1} ] Now, for ( k+1 ): [ P_{k+1} = pP_k - qP_{k-1} ] Using the inductive hypothesis: [ P_{k+1} = pQ_{k+1} - qQ_k ] This shows the relationship ( P_k = Q_{k+1} ) holds for all ( k ) by induction. 3. **Newton's method and continued fraction convergence**: Suppose ( x_n ) coincides with some suitable fraction ( frac{P_k}{Q_k} ). Substitute ( x_n ) in the Newton's method formula for ( x_{n+1} ): [ x_{n+1} = x_n - frac{x_n^2 - p x_n + q}{2 x_n - p} = frac{x_n^2 - q}{2 x_n - p} ] When ( x_n = frac{P_k}{Q_k} ): [ x_{n+1} = frac{left( frac{P_k}{Q_k} right)^2 - q}{2 left( frac{P_k}{Q_k} right) - p} ] Simplifying the numerator and the denominator: [ frac{P_k^2 - q Q_k^2}{2 P_k - p Q_k} ] Since ( P_k = Q_{k+1} ): [ frac{Q_{k+1}^2 - q Q_k^2}{2 Q_{k+1} - p Q_k} ] Identifying ( x_{n+1} ): This fraction again represents a continued fraction approximant of ( alpha ) or ( beta ).

Notice that: [ angle BAM = 90^circ - beta ] Similarly, for the angle angle CAO, by the property of central and inscribed angles: [ angle CAO = beta ] In triangle AOC, since it’s isosceles (being defined by the circumcenter), we have: [ angle AOC = 2beta ] Now, due to the angle bisector property, particularly that AK bisects angle BAC, the ray AK forms equal angles with segments AM and AO. Consequently: [ text{ray } AM text{ and ray } AO text{ are symmetric with respect to the ray } AK. ] 2. **Symmetric Properties**: Therefore, overline{AM} and overline{AO} are symmetric with respect to overline{AK}, but they cannot be coinciding since this would imply that triangle ABC is isosceles. 3. **Circumcircle and Angle Properties**: Now assume that A, M, K, O lie on the same circle k. Due to the properties of a cyclic quadrilateral: [ angle AKM = angle AKO ] This implies that segments KM and KO subtend equal angles at the circumference of the circle, hence KM = KO. 4. **Location of Points**: To consider the positions of these points geometrically, the points M, K, and O all lie interior of triangle ABC. The key observation here includes examining the loci of points equidistant from K. 5. **Geometric Construction**: - Suppose there exists a point P such that P sees segments KM and KO under the same angle. Because each such point lies on a unique arc—called the angle bisector arc of KM and KO—this divides scenarios into whether the P-arc views the segments externally or internally. 6. **Intersection Analysis**: - If both arcs view the segments externally, they coincide and thus enforce symmetry properties. If internally, the P point being valid gives that: [ k text{ is particularly symmetric about } overline{KM}. ] 7. **Reflection Argument**: Suppose B views the segments under these arcs’ conditions while C doesn’t; such instances would lead to contradictions unless B and C are symmetrically disposed about the perpendicular bisector of overline{MO}, maintaining the point K visibility in an internal manner. 8. **Combining Earlier Results**: Therefore, assuming that A, M, K, O are on the circle, leads through locus properties and arc segment ratios to conclude that the mentioned circle properties hold symmetrically for other vertices and especially for B and C under the separated O-M. **Conclusion:** If a circle passes through K, O, M, and one vertex of triangle ABC, then by construction and through symmetric argumentation along circle and arc properties, [ boxed{text {the circle passes through another vertex of the triangle as well}} ] Thus, proving the assertion comprehensively."},{"prompt":"Let ABC be a triangle and k be a positive number such that altitudes AD, BE, and CF are extended past A, B, and C to points A', B', and C' respectively, where AA' = kBC, BB' = kAC, and CC' = kAB.

Let's define events as follows: A_1 = {text{the individual dialed correctly on the first attempt}}, A_2 = {text{the individual dialed correctly on the second attempt}}, A_3 = {text{the individual dialed correctly on the third attempt}}. We aim to find the probability of event ( A ): A = A_1 + (overline{A_1} cap A_2) + (overline{A_1} cap overline{A_2} cap A_3), where (overline{A_i}) represents the complement event of (A_i), meaning the individual did not dial correctly on the (i)-th attempt.

Therefore, the probability can be expressed as: P(A) = P(A_1) + P(overline{A_1} cap A_2) + P(overline{A_1} cap overline{A_2} cap A_3). 1. **First Attempt:** The individual has 10 digits to choose from (0 through 9). The probability of guessing the correct digit on the first attempt is: P(A_1) = frac{1}{10}. If the first digit guessed is incorrect, the remaining possible choices are 9 digits out of which 1 is correct, so P(overline{A_1}) = 1 - P(A_1) = frac{9}{10}. 2. **Second Attempt:** Given the first attempt failed, the probability of guessing correctly on the second attempt from the 9 remaining digits is: P(A_2 mid overline{A_1}) = frac{1}{9}. Thus, the probability of dialing correctly on the second attempt is: P(overline{A_1} cap A_2) = P(overline{A_1}) cdot P(A_2 mid overline{A_1}) = frac{9}{10} cdot frac{1}{9} = frac{1}{10}. 3. **Third Attempt:** If both the first and the second attempts failed, the probability of guessing the correct digit from the remaining 8 digits is: P(A_3 mid overline{A_1} cap overline{A_2}) = frac{1}{8}. Thus, the probability of dialing correctly on the third attempt is: P(overline{A_1} cap overline{A_2} cap A_3) = P(overline{A_1}) cdot P(overline{A_2} mid overline{A_1}) cdot P(A_3 mid overline{A_1} cap overline{A_2}) = frac{9}{10} cdot frac{8}{9} cdot frac{1}{8} = frac{1}{10}.

Since Anya played exactly 4 games and there were no draws, she must have been defeated in these specific games. 3. By studying the structure and distribution of players: - Each time after playing, Anya had to rest because losers take rest. - For Anya to play 4 games, we need to find a pattern where she can alternate between resting and playing. 4.

Now consider the equation f(x) = a having two distinct real roots x_1 and x_2. Since x_2 > 1 and f(x) is decreasing for x > 1, there must be a local maximum of f(x) at x = 1. This results in f(1) = 4(1) - (1)^4 = 4 - 1 = 3. Because we are given that 1 < x_2 and f(x) is decreasing for x > 1, it must be the case that a leq f(1) = 3. Given f(x_1) = f(x_2) = a and by the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can infer that x_1 < 1 < x_2 since f(x) is increasing before x=1 and decreasing afterwards. To find the maximum value of x_2 - 1, we consider the function g(x) = f(x) - a. The function g(x) will have the same increasing and decreasing intervals as f(x), but it will cross the x-axis at x_1 and x_2, i.e., g(x_1) = g(x_2) = 0. If a is at its maximum, f(x_2) = a = f(1) which gives us x_2 = 1. Thus, x_2 - 1 will be at its maximum when a is at its maximum, which is 3. Therefore, for x_2 > 1 and f(x) = a, the maximum value of x_2 - 1 is boxed{0} as f(x) is decreasing past its local maximum at x=1. Hence, as a approaches its maximum value from below, x_2 approaches 1 from above and the difference x_2 - 1 reaches its maximum at 0."},{"prompt":"w many integers between 2000 and 9999 have four distinct digits? textbf{(A) }4032qquadtextbf{(B) }4536qquadtextbf{(C) }5040qquadtextbf{(D) }6480qquad textbf{(E) }6561","completion":"To solve this problem, we consider the constraints on each digit of a four-digit number within the specified range: 1. **First Digit**: The first digit of a four-digit number in this range can only be from 2 to 9, inclusive.

Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Definition and Basic Case Setup**: - Let's consider a convex polygon ( W ) with unit area. When a segment's endpoints are on the boundary of ( W ), it is called a chord of ( W ). 2. **Selecting a Directional Line and Chord**: - Take a fixed point ( O ) on the plane, and draw a directional line ( L ) passing through ( O ). This line ( L ) has an inclination angle ( alpha ). - For a given direction ( L ), draw lines parallel to ( L ) from each vertex of the polygon. Among these parallel lines, identify the longest chord ( L_0 ). 3. **Case 1: Longest Chord as a Side of ( W )**: - Consider the case where the longest chord ( L_0 ) parallels to ( L ) is exactly a side ( AB ) of the polygon ( W ). Here, there are two possibilities: - **Sub-case (i)**: All chords parallel to ( AB ) are of equal length ( AB ): - In this scenario, ( W ) is a parallelogram, say ( square ABCD ). - Let ( M ) be the intersection of diagonals, take points ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) on ( AB ) such that ( P_1P_2 = frac{1}{2} AB ). - Extend ( P_1M ) and ( P_2M ) to intersect ( CD ) at ( P_4 ) and ( P_5 ), respectively. Mark midpoints ( P_3 ) and ( P_6 ) of sides ( BC ) and ( AD ), respectively. - Thus, the hexagon ( P_1P_2P_3P_4P_5P_6 ) is a centrally symmetric inscribed hexagon of ( W ) with area ( frac{3}{4} ). - **Sub-case (ii)**: There exists at least one chord parallel to ( AB ) with length different from ( AB ): - Choose a parallel chord ( CD ) such that ( CD < AB ), construct another chord ( MN ) parallel to ( AB, CD ). - Let ( P ) be the midpoint of ( MN ). Connect ( AD ) and ( BC ) to their intersections at ( E ) and ( F ). We then construct a centrally symmetric hexagon. 4. **Case 2: Longest Chord Not a Side**: - For any directional line ( L ), if the longest chord ( L_0 ) is not a side, then adjust the length ( d ), between ( 0 ) and ( L_0 ), as we parallelly move in the direction ( alpha ) or ( 180^circ + alpha ) to find hexagon such that ( E, F ) are on ( W ). 5. **Constructing the Centrally Symmetric Hexagon**: - Let ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_6 ) be vertices of this centrally symmetric hexagon within ( W ), which partitions ( W ) into six triangular regions each associated with ( A_iA_{i+1} ) and external region ( M_i ). - Thus, ( S_1 + S_2 + ldots + S_6 = 1 - 6S ). 6. **Ensuring Maximum Area**: - Adjust the construction such that each of these triangles share equal area ( S ). - By comparing areas and ensuring no region overlaps, we deduce the necessary conditions through equalities and geometric transformations that imply each triangular region combined equals the ( frac{1}{9} ) constraint. - Finally, ( 6S geq frac{2}{3} ).

To determine if the given formula for the volume of the truncated pyramid is correct, we start by understanding the properties of a truncated pyramid. 2. The truncated pyramid in the problem has rectangular bases. To find its volume correctly, we need to recall the general formula for the volume of a truncated pyramid, which is: [ V = frac{m}{3}(T + sqrt{T t} + t) ] where: - (m) is the height of the truncated pyramid, - (T) is the area of the larger base, - (t) is the area of the smaller base. 3. Given the dimensions of the bases as: - Larger base: (a times b) - Smaller base: (c times d) Therefore, - (T = ab) - (t = cd) 4. Substitute these values into the volume formula: [ V = frac{m}{3}(ab + sqrt{ab cdot cd} + cd) ] 5. Calculate ( sqrt{ab cdot cd} ): [ sqrt{ab cdot cd} = sqrt{abcd} ] 6.

This leaves each cube with another snap exposed on the opposite side. - **Three Cubes**: Arranging three cubes in a linear form or a slight bend will not suffice as two outer snaps will always remain exposed. 3. **Four Cubes in a Linear Formation**: - Place four cubes in a line, snapping each cube to the next via one of their snapped sides. - The first cube's one snap is covered by the second cube. - The second cube's opposite snap is covered by the third cube. - The third cube's opposite snap is covered by the fourth cube. - This configuration ensures that the linear arrangement of four cubes covers all snaps.

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the percentage of professors who are women. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of each set minus the size of their intersection: W + T - (W ∩ T) = 90% We know T = 70%, so we can substitute that into the equation: W + 70 - (W ∩ T) = 90% Now, we need to find the intersection (W ∩ T), which represents the percentage of professors who are both women and tenured. We can find this by considering the information about the men professors. Let M be the percentage of professors who are men. Since the total percentage must add up to 100%, we have: W + M = 100% We are given that 52% of the men are tenured. Since T = 70%, and 52% of M are tenured, the remaining tenured professors must be women. Therefore, the percentage of tenured professors who are women is T minus 52% of M: (W ∩ T) = T - 0.52M Since M = 100% - W, we can substitute M in the equation: (W ∩ T) = 70% - 0.52(100% - W) (W ∩ T) = 70% - 52% + 0.52W (W ∩ T) = 18% + 0.52W Now we can substitute (W ∩ T) back into the inclusion-exclusion equation: W + 70% - (18% + 0.52W) = 90% W + 70% - 18% - 0.52W = 90% 0.48W + 52% = 90% 0.48W = 90% - 52% 0.48W = 38% Now we solve for W: W = 38% / 0.48 W = 79.1667% Therefore, approximately boxed{79.17%} of the professors are women."},{"prompt":"Tom went to the store to buy fruit.

The total cost with the discount is 21, so the equation without the discount minus the discount should equal 21: (6L + 4 + 8) - 3 = 21. Simplifying the equation gives us: 6L + 12 - 3 = 21.

Let's consider the integer pairs ((x, 101 - x)). Every integer (x) from 1 to 50 will have a pair (101-x) forming 50 such pairs: [ (1, 100), (2, 99), (3, 98), ldots, (50, 51) ] 2. **Top and bottom halves**: When arranged in a circle, each integer is exactly opposite to its pair such that if one integer from the pair is in the top semicircle, the other must be in the bottom semicircle. By taking any one of either (x) or (101-x) for each pair, we are left with deciding the positions of these pairs' representatives in the circle. 3. **Arranging one half**: We can freely place one member of each pair (from the 50 pairs) into the top half of the circle. There are (50!) different ways to arrange these 50 members in the top half. 4. **Choosing members within pairs**: Each of these 50 chosen placements in the top half can correspond to either the smaller or the larger of the pair ((x, 101-x)). Hence, there are (2^{50}) ways to choose which member from each pair (either (x) or (101-x)) goes into the top half. 5. **Rotational symmetry**: Since the circle arrangement is rotational, any arrangement can be rotated into 100 equivalent arrangements (one for each position in the circle). We must therefore divide by 100 to account for this rotational symmetry. Combining these calculations: [ frac{50! cdot 2^{50}}{100} = frac{50! cdot 2^{50}}{100} = frac{50! cdot 2^{50}}{2^2 cdot 5^2} = frac{50! cdot 2^{50}}{4 cdot 25} = frac{50! cdot 2^{50}}{100} = frac{50! cdot 2^{50}}{10^2} = 49! cdot 2^{49} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the number of ways to arrange the integers from 1 to 100 in a circle such that the sum of every two integers placed opposite each other is the same is: [ boxed{49! cdot 2^{49}} ]"},{"prompt":"f sqrt{2x} + sqrt{x2} + y = 4, find the value of x^y.","completion":"First, we need to ensure that the square roots in the equation are defined.

(A palindrome is a natural number that reads the same both from left to right and from right to left.)","completion":"To determine if there exists a natural number that can be represented as the product of two palindromes in more than 100 ways, consider the following approach. 1. Define the palindrome in the form (1_n = underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{n}). 2. We know that if ( n ) is a multiple of ( k ), then (1_n) is divisible by the palindrome (1_k), and the quotient is also a palindrome composed of ones, spaced by groups of (k-1) zeros. 3. Choose an ( n ) such that the number has more than 100 factors. For instance, (2^{101}). 4. **Verification**: When (n) is chosen such that it has more than 100 proper divisors, it serves to construct invariants, and consequent dividers that are indeed palindromes. On verifying the divisor count of (2^{101}), the prime factorization yields 102 factors ((2^0, 2^1, ldots, 2^{101})). Therefore, this will satisfy the requirement of having more than 100 ways to represent the number as a product of two palindromes. 5. **Observation**: The number (6_n) is divisible not only by (1_k) but also by (2_k, 3_k), and (6_k). This can reduce (n) to a number having more than 25 proper divisors. 6. **Example**: Considering ( n=720 = 2^4 cdot 3^2 cdot 5 ), its total number of divisors: [ (4+1) cdot (2+1) cdot (1+1) = 5 cdot 3 cdot 2 = 30 ] Satisfies having more than 25 proper divisors.

With 8 factors available, one can generate (2^7 = 128) different ways to factorize (1_{256}) into two groups. Each product represents ( 1_{256} ) in a different way as a product of two palindromes because of the coprimality of the initial factors. 9. **Further observations**: Using similar insights as noted above with (6_{64}) and extending factors in a similar way: [ 11 cdot 101 cdot 1001 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{3}1 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{4}1 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{5}1 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{6}1 cdot 1 underbrace{0 ldots 0}_{7}1 ] We have shown by multiple examples that there exists a natural number that can be represented as a product of two palindromes in more than 100 distinct ways.

Using Lagrange's formula for the ( p )-adic valuation of factorials, we have: [ nu_p(n!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor. ] For ( n = Np^a + x ), we need to evaluate: [ nu_p((Np^a + x)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{Np^a + x}{p^k} rightrfloor. ] For ( k leq a ), we have: [ leftlfloor frac{Np^a + x}{p^k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{Np^a}{p^k} + frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{Np^a}{p^k} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor, ] because ( p^a > 1000x ) ensures that ( frac{x}{p^k} ) is very small for ( k leq a ). For ( k > a ), since ( p^a mid Np^a ), we have: [ leftlfloor frac{Np^a + x}{p^k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{Np^a}{p^k} + frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor, ] because ( frac{Np^a}{p^k} ) is an integer and ( frac{x}{p^k} ) is very small. Therefore, combining these results, we get: [ nu_p((Np^a + x)!) = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{Np^a}{p^k} rightrfloor + sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{x}{p^k} rightrfloor = nu_p((Np^a)!) + nu_p(x!). ] This completes the proof of the claim. (blacksquare) 2. **Constructing the Sequence**: We construct a sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots ) of powers of ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) where the exponents grow quickly enough such that, by the claim, for any ( x neq y ), we have: [ nu_{p_i}((a_x + a_y)!) = nu_{p_i}(a_x!) + nu_{p_i}(a_y!) ] for all ( 1 leq i leq k ). 3. **Infinite Pigeonhole Principle**: By the infinite pigeonhole principle, there exists some ( k )-tuple ( (b_1, ldots, b_k) ) such that there exist infinitely many ( m ) such that: [ (nu_{p_1}(a_m!), ldots, nu_{p_k}(a_m!)) equiv (b_1, ldots, b_k) pmod{d}. ] 4. **Combining the Results**: Take any ( d ) distinct ( m ) satisfying this, say ( i_1, ldots, i_d ). By the construction of the sequence, we have: [ (nu_{p_1}((a_{i_1} + cdots + a_{i_d})!), ldots, nu_{p_k}((a_{i_1} + cdots + a_{i_d})!)) equiv (db_1, ldots, db_k) equiv (0, ldots, 0) pmod{d}. ] Since there are infinitely many ways to do this, we are done.

Otherwise, suppose the number is in the form of frac{m}{n} = 0.X347 ldots, where X is a string of k digits and n is small as possible. Then 10^k cdot frac{m}{n} - X = frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = 0.347 ldots. Since 10^k m - nX is an integer and frac{10^k m - nX}{n} is a fraction between 0 and 1, we can rewrite this as frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = frac{p}{q}, where q le n. Then the fraction frac{p}{q} = 0.347 ldots suffices. Thus we have frac{m}{n} = 0.347ldots, or frac{347}{1000} le frac{m}{n} < frac{348}{1000} Longleftrightarrow 347n le 1000m < 348n Longleftrightarrow n le frac{1000m}{347} < 2n. As 1000m > 347n, we know that the minimum value of 1000m - 347n is 1; hence we need frac{1000}{347} < 2n Longrightarrow frac{1000}{694} < n.

This includes numbers like 1234567 or 1123459, but not 1233210 because the digits must be in increasing or equal order without decreasing. 2. **Representing the Problem**: We can think of each digit as a choice of where to place a ball into one of 9 urns (labeled 1 through 9), where each urn represents a digit. The reason we only have 9 urns instead of 10 is that 0 cannot be the leading digit of the number, making it a 7-digit number. 3. **Using the Ball-and-Urn Argument**: To find the number of ways to place 7 balls into 9 urns, we can use the ball-and-urn method (also known as stars and bars). This method requires us to find the number of ways to distribute 7 identical items (balls) among 9 distinct groups (urns). 4. **Calculating the Number of Ways**: The formula for the ball-and-urn method is given by {n + k - 1 choose k}, where n is the number of urns, and k is the number of balls. In our case, n = 9 and k = 7, so we have {9 + 7 - 1 choose 7} = {15 choose 7}. 5. **Computing {15 choose 7}**: The value of {15 choose 7} is calculated as frac{15!}{7! cdot (15-7)!} = frac{15!}{7! cdot 8!}.

Since O is the incenter, angle BOC can be calculated using internal angle bisectors and properties of the triangle: [ angle BOC = 180^circ - left( frac{beta}{2} + frac{gamma}{2} right) ] Using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^circ, it simplifies to: [ angle BOC = 180^circ - frac{(beta + gamma)}{2} = 180^circ - frac{180^circ - alpha}{2} = 90^circ + frac{alpha}{2} ] 3. **Applying the Sine Law in triangle BOC**: Using the Sine Law in triangle BOC: [ frac{OC}{sin left( angle B right)} = frac{BC}{sin left( angle BOC right)} ] With a = BC and substituting sin (90^circ + frac{alpha}{2}) = cos frac{alpha}{2}, we have: [ OC = frac{a sin frac{beta}{2}}{cos frac{alpha}{2}} ] 4. **Relating OC to r**: The radius r of the inscribed circle is perpendicular to BC and forms a right-angled segment.

Its derivative is given by: [ k'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2} ] - For x > e, 1 - ln x < 0, so k'(x) < 0, meaning k(x) is decreasing for x > e. - Thus, for e leq x < y: [ frac{ln x}{x} > frac{ln y}{y} ] - This implies: [ y ln x > x ln y quad text{and hence} quad x^y > y^x ] 5. **Induction hypothesis:** - Suppose e < f(2n) < f(2n-1). - From the sequence definition, we have: [ x = f(2n-1)^{f(2n)} = f(2n)^{f(2n+1)} ] - Since f(2n-1) > f(2n) and using (P), we have f(2n) < f(2n+1).

This transforms the initial inequality into: [ s^2 + t^2 geq sqrt{s^2 t^2} + sqrt{frac{s^4 + t^4}{2}} ] Simplifying (sqrt{s^2 t^2}) gives (st).

This operation does not affect the product of all numbers on the board because: - Each flip of a sign inverts ( +1 ) to ( -1 ) or ( -1 ) to ( +1 ), effectively introducing an additional factor of ( -1 ) for each cell in the chosen row or column. - Since a row or column contains 8 cells (and flipping introduces 8 factors of ( -1 )), the overall product changes by ( (-1)^8 = 1 ). 3. **Preservation of Product**: Therefore, the product of all numbers always remains the same after each operation.

The inequality (6n^2 geq 1) holds for all non-zero integers (n). However, (n = 0) does not satisfy the condition. 10. Since (n = 0) is an exception, and it doesn't satisfy the property stated in the initial claim, the statement isn’t true for all integers. **Conclusion:** The assertion is not correct in the form “for all integers”, but it becomes correct if rephrased to “for all non-zero integers” or “for all natural numbers”.

The player who cannot make a move according to these rules loses. What is the winning strategy? Who wins with optimal play?","completion":"1. **Initial Move**: The first player initiates the game by drawing a diagonal through the center of the 1968-gon (polygon with 1968 vertices). Since the polygon is regular and has an even number of sides, there exists a central symmetry which the first player can exploit. 2. **Symmetric Strategy**: After making the initial move, the first player adopts a symmetric strategy for subsequent moves. - Suppose the second player draws a segment connecting two vertices. According to the rules, this segment cannot intersect any previously drawn segment and cannot connect two vertices, at least one of which is already connected. - The first player then responds by drawing a segment that is the symmetrical counterpart of the second player's segment with respect to the initial diagonal that was drawn through the center of the polygon. 3. **Play Mechanics**: Here’s how this works in detail: - If the second player connects vertices (A) and (B), where (A) and (B) are vertices on one side of the initial diagonal, the first player connects the vertices (A') and (B'), which are the reflections of (A) and (B) across the initial diagonal. - This ensures that the segment drawn by the first player does not intersect any previously drawn segment because it mirrors the second player's segment. - At each step, the number of free vertices on either side of the diagonal remains balanced due to the symmetrical placements. 4. **Winning Condition**: To win, the first player must ensure that the symmetrical counterpart to any possible move by the second player is always available: - Given the 1968 vertices, initially none of them are connected, meaning the player has the full capacity to start the symmetric strategy. - As long as the first player continues to mirror the second player’s moves relative to the initial diagonal, the second player will be the one who eventually runs out of permissible segments to draw based on the rules provided. # Conclusion Based on this symmetric strategy, the first player can force the second player into a losing position, ensuring that it is always the second player who cannot make the next move according to the rules.

Finally, we find the minimum value of frac{1}{x}+frac{2}{y} under the constraint mx+ny=3. **Step 1: Apply the Law of Sines for condition ①** Given a=7, b=8, and A=30^{circ}, we use the Law of Sines: frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} implies sin B = frac{b cdot sin A}{a} = frac{8 cdot frac{1}{2}}{7} = frac{4}{7} Since frac{4}{7} > frac{1}{2}, and knowing that the sine function takes values greater than frac{1}{2} for angles both in the first quadrant (acute angles) and the second quadrant (obtuse angles) up to 90^{circ}, angle B has two solutions in this case: one acute and one obtuse.

In this case, (b_{i1}, b_{i2}, cdots, b_{in}) represents any rearrangement of (b_1, b_2, cdots, b_n). 2. **Step 2: Consider the properties of these permutations.** Given any function that applies to (b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}), if the function is symmetric, the value will remain the same regardless of how (b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}) are permuted. 3. **Step 3: Using inequality properties with permutations.** Let's consider the inequality that holds under permutation for symmetric functions: If (f(x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n)) is a symmetric function, then for any permutation (sigma), (f(x_{sigma(1)}, x_{sigma(2)}, cdots, x_{sigma(n)}) = f(x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n)). 4. **Step 4: Apply specific symmetric function (f(x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n) = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n).** [ f(b_1, b_2, cdots, b_n) = b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n ] For any permutation (sigma), [ f(b_{sigma(1)}, b_{sigma(2)}, cdots, b_{sigma(n)}) = b_{sigma(1)} + b_{sigma(2)} + cdots + b_{sigma(n)} = b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n ] 5. **Conclusion:** Since the sum (sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i) remains the same under any permutation, we can use properties like symmetric sums or polynomial roots symmetry to prove further properties related to inequalities and permutations.

Note that (a_{i + 1} mod 17) is the same whether (a_{i + 1} = 9a_i) or (a_{i + 1} = a_i / 2). This is because both operations are multiplicative and can be reduced modulo 17. 3.

According to the problem statement, we have (n-2) cdot 180° < 360° Solving this, we get n < 4. Since n is a positive integer and n geq 3, we have n=3.

We need to determine the number of integers ( n ) in the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 300} ) such that ( n ) is the product of two distinct primes and is the length of the longest leg of a nondegenerate right triangle with integer side lengths. 2. Let ( n = p cdot q ) for distinct primes ( p ) and ( q ) where ( p < q ). We consider ( n ) as one of the legs in a right triangle, such that there exist integers ( c ) (the hypotenuse) and ( a ) (the other leg) satisfying the Pythagorean theorem: [ (pq)^2 + a^2 = c^2. ] 3. This can be rewritten using the difference of squares: [ (pq)^2 = c^2 - a^2 = (c-a)(c+a). ] 4. Since ( c-a < c+a ), the pairs ((c-a, c+a)) should be factorizations of ( (pq)^2 ). We analyze the possible factorizations: - Case 1: ( c-a = 1 ) and ( c+a = (pq)^2 ) [ a = frac{(pq)^2 - 1}{2}. ] For this value of ( a ): [ a = frac{p^2q^2 - 1}{2} > pq, ] hence this case does not provide valid solutions. - Case 2: ( c-a = p ) and ( c+a = pq^2 ) [ a = frac{pq^2 - p}{2}. ] For this value of ( a ): [ frac{pq^2 - p}{2} > pq, ] hence this case also does not provide valid solutions. - Case 3: ( c-a = p^2 ) and ( c+a = q^2 ) [ a = frac{q^2 - p^2}{2}. ] For this value of ( a ): [ a < pq. ] 5. From the inequality ( frac{q^2 - p^2}{2} < pq ), we derive: [ q^2 - p^2 < 2pq. ] This simplifies to: [ q^2 < 2pq + p^2, ] and further, [ 2q^2 < (q+p)^2. ] 6. Taking the square root of both sides: [ sqrt{2} q < q + p. ] Finally, rearrange to get: [ (sqrt{2} - 1)q < p. ] 7. We need to find all pairs of distinct primes ( (p, q) ) such that ( p q < 300 ) and ( (sqrt{2} - 1)q < p < q ). 8. Checking pairs of distinct primes ( p < q ) such that ( p q < 300 ) reveals that there are 13 such pairs: [ {(3,5), (3,7), (5,7), (5,11), (7,11), (7,13), (11,13), (11,17), (11,19), (11,23), (13,17), (13,19), (13,23)}. ] 9.

Since (C) is the point where the line intersects the plane, it serves as a critical point for further analysis. 2. **Tangent Point**: Assume (M) is the point of tangency of one of the sought spheres with the plane (Pi). 3. **Distance Relationship**: Since (M) is a point of tangency, by the Power of a Point theorem, we have: [ CM^2 = CA cdot CB ] From this relationship, we know that the point (M) lies on a circle with radius (sqrt{CA cdot CB}) centered at (C). 4. **Location of Center (O)**: The center (O) of the sphere must lie on a right cylinder whose base is this circle (found in step 3) with radius (sqrt{CA cdot CB}). 5. **Perpendicularity Condition**: Additionally, since the sphere is tangent to the plane (Pi) at (M), the radius (OM) must be perpendicular to the plane (Pi). 6. **Equidistance from (A) and (B)**: Center (O) must also be equidistant from points (A) and (B). This follows because the sphere passes through both (A) and (B). Therefore: [ OA = OB ] This means that (O) lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment (AB). 7. **Combining Conditions**: Combining these conditions, the locus of points (O) that are equidistant from (A) and (B) and lie on the perpendicular bisector of (AB) forms a plane perpendicular to (AB) and passing through its midpoint.

With radius r, the equation of the circle is (x-a)^2+(y-6)^2=r^2. As point B lies on the circle, we have (1-a)^2+16=r^2.

We need to find the values of ( k ) such that the three flies meet at a location different from their starting point.

Let ( t ) be the time in seconds when the flies meet again at a location different from their starting point. The positions of the flies at time ( t ) can be described by the following congruences: [ 2t equiv 6t equiv kt pmod{1000} ] 3. For the flies to meet at the same point, the positions must be congruent modulo 1000. This gives us the system of congruences: [ 2t equiv 6t pmod{1000} ] [ 6t equiv kt pmod{1000} ] 4. From the first congruence, we have: [ 2t equiv 6t pmod{1000} implies 4t equiv 0 pmod{1000} implies t equiv 0 pmod{250} ] This implies that ( t ) must be a multiple of 250. 5.

After arranging them, there will be 6 spaces where A and B can potentially be placed (before the first person, between any two consecutive people, and after the last person). We choose 2 out of these 6 spaces to place A and B, which can be done in P(6,2) = frac{6!}{(6-2)!} = 30 ways.

Let us assume that the distances from point ( P ) to the vertices ( A ) and ( B ) of the square are equal to 1, and the distance to the vertex ( C ) is equal to 3. 2. Since point ( P ) is on the plane with a square, we can use the triangle inequality to analyze the distances: [ AB < PA + PB = 1 + 1 = 2 ] [ AC > PC - PA = 3 - 1 = 2 ] 3. From the assumption, distance ( PA = 1 ) and distance ( PB = 1 ). According to the triangle inequality, for any triangle with vertices ( A, B, ) and ( P ): [ AB < PA + PB = 1 + 1 = 2 ] This implies that ( AB < 2 ). 4. Now consider ( A ) and ( C ). From the assumption ( AC = d ), ( d ) represents the diagonal of the square. Applying the triangle inequality: [ AC > PC - PA = 3 - 1 = 2 ] This implies that ( AC > 2 ). 5. Since ( AC ) is the diagonal of the square, in a square with side ( s ), the diagonal ( AC ) is given by: [ AC = ssqrt{2} ] We know that for a square side length ( s ): [ ssqrt{2} > 2 ] Solving for ( s ): [ s > frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} ] 6. Notice that the distance ( AC ) which represents the diagonal distance being more than 2 contradicts the previous assertion from triangle inequality ( AB < 2 ). 7. Furthermore, a similar argument can be applied involving other vertices. If ( B ) and ( C )'s distances are to be computed and compared with both distances, analogous inequalities show that a similar contradiction will arise. Conclusion: The assumption that the distances from point ( P ) to the vertices of the square are 1, 1, 2, and 3 leads to contradictions given the properties of the square and the triangle inequalities.

This constant distance is equal to 2a, where a is the semi-major axis of the hyperbola. Therefore, we have: [2m = 2a] This implies that m = a.

Given that there are 6 kinds of ice cream, and we need to choose 2 out of these for each sundae, we calculate the number of combinations using the combination formula, which is: [ binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} ] where n is the total number of items to choose from, r is the number of items to choose, ! denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number (e.g., 5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120).

Hence: [ AB = AK = BK. ] 4. **Establish triangle congruence:** Note that triangles ( ABC ) and ( KBD ) have the following: - ( AB = AK ), - ( AC = KD ), - (angle BAC = angle BDK = 120^circ). By the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criterion, triangles ( ABC ) and ( KBD ) are congruent: [ triangle ABC cong triangle KBD. ] 5. **Consequences of triangle congruence:** Therefore, the sides opposite to equal angles are equal: [ BC = BD. ] Additionally, this implies: [ angle DBC = angle CBA. ] 6. **Summing angles to identify an equilateral triangle:** By adding the equal angles: [ angle DBC + angle KBC = angle CBA. ] Simultaneously, considering ( angle KBC = 60^circ ), it follows that: [ angle KBC = 60^circ - angle DBC. ] This calculation implies triangle ( DBC ) is isosceles with a ( 60^circ ) angle at ( D ), making it equilateral: - All sides ( BD = BC ), - All angles ( angle DBC = 60^circ ). # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that triangle ( DBC ) is equilateral. boxed{text{Equilateral triangle }}"},{"prompt":"Let p be an odd prime number.

Note that ( X ) and ( Y ) form a complete residue system modulo ( p ). This means that every integer from ( 1 ) to ( 2p ) can be represented uniquely modulo ( p ) by an element in ( X cup Y ). 2. **Translation and trivial subsets:** For a subset ( A subset X ) and ( z in mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z} ), define ( A + z = {a + z mod p mid a in A} ). Similarly, for a subset ( B subset Y ), define ( B + z = {b + z mod p mid b in B} ). A subset ( A subset X ) is called trivial if ( A = emptyset ) or ( A = X ). Similarly, a subset ( B subset Y ) is trivial if ( B = emptyset ) or ( B = Y ). 3. **Nontrivial subsets and translation:** Consider a nontrivial subset ( P subset (X cup Y) ). Define a translation for ( P ): - If ( P cap X ) is nontrivial, define ( P + z = ((P cap X) + z) cup (P cap Y) ). - If ( P cap Y ) is nontrivial, define ( P + z = (P cap X) cup ((P cap Y) + z) ). 4. **Sum of elements modulo ( p ):** When ( z ) goes through all possible residue classes modulo ( p ), the sum of the elements of ( P + z ) also goes through all possible residue classes modulo ( p ). Therefore, there is exactly one value of ( z ) for which the sum of the elements of ( P + z ) is divisible by ( p ). 5. **Counting the subsets:** There are exactly ( binom{2p}{p} ) subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, 2p} ) with ( p ) elements. Among these, 2 subsets are trivial (the subsets ( X ) and ( Y )). The nontrivial subsets can be divided into equivalence classes of ( p ) sets each, where each class has exactly one subset whose sum of elements is divisible by ( p ). 6. **Final calculation:** The number of nontrivial ( p )-element subsets is ( binom{2p}{p} - 2 ). Since each equivalence class contains ( p ) subsets, the number of equivalence classes is ( frac{binom{2p}{p} - 2}{p} ). Adding the 2 trivial subsets, the total number of ( p )-element subsets whose sum is divisible by ( p ) is: [ frac{binom{2p}{p} - 2}{p} + 2 ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{binom{2p}{p} - 2}{p} + 2})"},{"prompt":"A, B, C, D, E, F, G are seven people sitting around a circular table.

We need to prove that all such lines determined by connecting these intersection points pass through a common point lying on the line ( l ). 3. Let the intersections of ( RK ) and ( RP ) with the circle ( S ) again denote points named ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ) respectively. 4. Using a projective transformation argument similar to part (a), we map the configuration such that the circle ( S ) remains invariant, and some chosen configurations become infinite. 5. Under these transformations, the intersection points of any line through ( R ) and tangent properties with respect to the circle ( S ) are preserved in the projective plane. So the points ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ) determined by ( RK ) and ( RP ) when joined will intersect at a common point. 6. This common intersection under such transformations must lie on the original line ( l ), being preserved by the projective properties from the transformation.

Speed of the train = 36 km/hour To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds Speed of the train in m/s = 36 km/h * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Speed of the train in m/s = 36 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 36 * (10 / 36) Speed of the train in m/s = 10 m/s Now that we have the speed in the correct units, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to pass the bridge = Total distance to cover / Speed of the train in m/s Time to pass the bridge = 845 meters / 10 m/s Time to pass the bridge = 84.5 seconds Therefore, it will take the train boxed{84.5} seconds to pass the bridge."},{"prompt":"The equation x^{2}+y^{2}+Dx+Ey+F=0 represents a circle with center at (2,3) and radius 4.

Let's denote the time it takes for the first train to travel from one signal to the next as t_1. The train reaches Signal n at time [ s_1 + (n - 2)m_1 ] where s_1 = t_1 and m_1 = t_1.

This implies that each subsequent train waits for the slower trains ahead if necessary. 3. **Adding (k+1)-th Train**: We now add a (k+1)-th train behind the others at Signal 1. We consider two cases based on the relation of t_{k+1} with m_k. **Case (i) t_{k+1} geq m_k:** For this case, we have m_{k+1} = t_{k+1} and Train (k+1) is the slowest among the trains up to Train (k+1). - **Departure:** Train (k+1) leaves Signal 1 when all the others reach Signal 2, which by the induction happens at time s_k. - **Journey:** Since Train k arrives at Signal i + 1 at time [ s_k + (i - 1)m_k ] which is less than or equal to [ s_k + (i - 1)t_{k+1}, ] Train (k+1) does not have to wait and travels without stopping. - **Arrival:** It reaches Signal N at time [ s_k + (n - 1)t_{k+1} = s_{k+1} + (n - 2)m_{k+1}, ] where s_{k+1} = s_k + t_{k+1}. **Case (ii) t_{k+1} < m_k:** For this case, we have m_{k+1} = m_k and Train (k+1) is faster than at least one train in the preceding k trains. - **Departure:** Train (k+1) leaves Signal 1 at time s_k and reaches Signal 2 at time s_k + t_{k+1}. - **Wait:** Since Train (k+1) is faster, upon reaching Signal 2, it waits until all other trains get to Signal 3, which happens at time s_k + m_k (induction hypothesis). - **Movement:** Then Train (k+1) continues to Signal 3 at time s_k + m_k + t_{k+1} and successively reaches Signal 4 at time s_k + 2m_k + t_{k+1} and so on. - **Arrival:** Thus, Train (k+1) arrives at Signal N at time [ s_k + (n - 2) m_k + t_{k+1} = s_{k+1} + (n - 2)m_{k+1}, ] where s_{k+1} = s_k + t_{k+1}.

Such a path is called a Hamiltonian path if not closed, and a Hamiltonian circuit if closed. 3. **Parity consideration:** To determine whether a Hamiltonian circuit exists, note that in an (n+1) times (m+1) grid, the length of the closed path (Hamiltonian circuit) should cover all (n+1)(m+1) nodes once.

First, we find the derivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = ax^2 - 4x + c Since f(x) is monotonically increasing on R, we require f'(x) geq 0 for all x in R. 2. The discriminant of the quadratic equation f'(x)=0 must be non-positive to satisfy f'(x) geq 0 for all x in R. So, (4)^2 - 4ac leq 0 16 - 4ac leq 0 This results in ac geq 4. However, the problem states that ac leq 4, so the only possible value is ac = 4. 3. Now, let's simplify the given expression: frac{a}{c^2+4}+frac{c}{a^2+4} Since ac=4, we can substitute a=frac{4}{c} or c=frac{4}{a} into the expression. We'll use c=frac{4}{a}: frac{a}{frac{16}{a^2}+4}+frac{frac{4}{a}}{a^2+4} Multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of the first term by a^2, and the second term by a to simplify the expression: frac{a^3}{16+4a^2}+frac{4}{a^3+4a} 4.

Simplifying the expression under the square root: frac{4a^3}{(16+4a^2)(a^3+4a)} = frac{4a^3}{16a^3+64a+4a^5+16a^3} = frac{4a^3}{4a^5+32a^3+64a} 6. Factoring out 4a from the denominator: frac{4a^3}{4a(a^4+8a^2+16)} = frac{a^2}{a^4+8a^2+16} 7. Recognizing that a^4+8a^2+16 is a perfect square, we have: frac{a^2}{(a^2+4)^2} 8. Now, applying the AM-GM inequality to the denominator: (a^2+4)^2 geq 2sqrt{a^2 cdot 4^2} = 8a 9. Therefore, frac{a^2}{(a^2+4)^2} geq frac{a^2}{8a} = frac{a}{8} 10.

First, let's find out how many even numbers there are up to 170. Since 170 is even, we can simply divide it by 2 to find out how many even numbers there are up to 170: 170 / 2 = 85 So, there are 85 even numbers up to 170. Now, we need to find out how many of these even numbers are also divisible by 3.

The largest multiple of 6 less than or equal to 170 is 168 (which is 6 * 28).

Prove that there are three people who are all mutual friends (each person is friends with the other two).","completion":"To prove that in a group of 11 people, where each person is friends with at least 6 other people, there exists a set of three mutual friends (a triangle), we use graph theory. 1. **Graph Representation**: - Represent the group as a graph (G = (V, E)), where each vertex (v in V) represents a person, and each edge (e in E) represents a friendship between two people. 2. **Degree Condition**: - Given that each person (vertex) is friends with at least 6 other people, the minimum degree (delta(G) geq 6). 3. **Overview of the Argument**: - We will show that in a graph of 11 vertices where each vertex has a degree of at least 6, a triangle (three mutual friends) must exist. 4. **Contradiction Approach**: - Assume that the graph (G) is triangle-free (i.e., no three vertices form a triangle). 5. **Edge Counting**: - Use the known bounds for the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph. - According to Turan's theorem, the maximum number of edges (E) in a triangle-free graph on (n) vertices is (E leq frac{n^2}{4}). 6. **Calculation**: - For (n = 11), this upper bound is: [ E leq frac{11^2}{4} = frac{121}{4} = 30.25 ] Since the number of edges must be an integer, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph with 11 vertices is (E leq 30). 7. **Degree Sum**: - The sum of the degrees in the graph can be calculated as: [ 2E ] This is due to the fact that each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices. 8. **Required Minimum Degree**: - Given that each vertex has at least 6 friends (degree 6): [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) geq 11 times 6 = 66 ] 9. **Comparison**: - If ( sum deg(v) geq 66) and (2E leq 60) (since (E leq 30)), we reach a contradiction because: [ sum deg(v) = 2E quad Rightarrow quad 66 leq 60 ] This contradiction shows that our assumption of no triangles is false. 10. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, in a graph where each vertex has at least 6 neighbors and there are 11 vertices, a triangle must exist.

The exam paper only had two questions. It is known that student A has a probability of p of answering each question correctly, while student B has a probability of q of answering each question correctly, with p > q. It is also known that the probability of both student A and student B answering a question correctly is frac{1}{3}, and the probability of exactly one of them answering a question correctly is frac{1}{2}. (1) Find the values of p and q; Solution for (1): Given that the probability of both student A and student B answering a question correctly is frac{1}{3} and the probability of exactly one of them answering a question correctly is frac{1}{2}, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. For both answering correctly: pq = frac{1}{3} 2. For only one answering correctly: p(1-q) + q(1-p) = frac{1}{2} Expanding and simplifying the second equation gives us p - pq + q - pq = frac{1}{2}, which simplifies further to p + q - 2pq = frac{1}{2}. Substituting the value of pq from the first equation into the second equation, we have p + q - 2left(frac{1}{3}right) = frac{1}{2}, leading to p + q = frac{7}{6}. Solving this system of equations, we find two possible sets of solutions: - p = frac{1}{2}, q = frac{2}{3} - p = frac{2}{3}, q = frac{1}{2} Given that p > q, we select p = frac{2}{3} and q = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, p = frac{2}{3} and q = frac{1}{2}, and we encapsulate the final answers as boxed{p = frac{2}{3}} and boxed{q = frac{1}{2}}. (2) Find the probability that both students answer 3 questions correctly. Solution for (2): Let's define: - A_{1}={student A answered 1 question correctly} - A_{2}={student A answered 2 questions correctly} - B_{1}={student B answered 1 question correctly} - B_{2}={student B answered 2 questions correctly} The probabilities are calculated as follows: - P(A_{1}) = frac{2}{3} cdot frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} cdot frac{2}{3} = frac{4}{9} - P(A_{2}) = left(frac{2}{3}right)^{2} = frac{4}{9} - P(B_{1}) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} - P(B_{2}) = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{2} = frac{1}{4} Let E be the event that both student A and student B answered 3 questions correctly, then E corresponds to the events A_{1}B_{2} and A_{2}B_{1}. Since A_{i} and B_{i} are independent, and A_{1}B_{2} and A_{2}B_{1} are mutually exclusive, we have: [P(E) = P(A_{1}B_{2}) + P(A_{2}B_{1}) = P(A_{1})P(B_{2}) + P(A_{2})P(B_{1}) = frac{4}{9} cdot frac{1}{4} + frac{4}{9} cdot frac{1}{2}] Calculating, we get: [P(E) = frac{4}{9} cdot frac{1}{4} + frac{4}{9} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{9} + frac{2}{9} = frac{1}{3}] Therefore, the probability that both student A and student B answer 3 questions correctly is boxed{frac{1}{3}}."},{"prompt":"Given that S_{n} is the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, and it satisfies S_{3}=9, a_{4}=7.

[Spanish version](http://www.mathlinks.ro/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=88509) text{LaTeX}{} ed by carlosbr","completion":"To solve the given problem, we need to find all positive integer solutions ((x, y, z)) such that the expression [ sqrt{frac{2006}{x+y}} + sqrt{frac{2006}{y+z}} + sqrt{frac{2006}{z+x}} ] is an integer. Let's denote this integer by (k). Therefore, we have: [ sqrt{frac{2006}{x+y}} + sqrt{frac{2006}{y+z}} + sqrt{frac{2006}{z+x}} = k ] 1. **Expressing the terms as perfect squares:** For the sum of square roots to be an integer, each term (sqrt{frac{2006}{x+y}}), (sqrt{frac{2006}{y+z}}), and (sqrt{frac{2006}{z+x}}) must be rational. This implies that (frac{2006}{x+y}), (frac{2006}{y+z}), and (frac{2006}{z+x}) must be perfect squares of rational numbers. Let: [ frac{2006}{x+y} = r_1^2, quad frac{2006}{y+z} = r_2^2, quad frac{2006}{z+x} = r_3^2 ] where (r_1, r_2, r_3) are rational numbers. This gives us: [ x + y = frac{2006}{r_1^2}, quad y + z = frac{2006}{r_2^2}, quad z + x = frac{2006}{r_3^2} ] 2. **Solving for (x, y, z):** We can solve these equations for (x, y, z) in terms of (r_1, r_2, r_3): [ x = frac{2006}{r_3^2} + frac{2006}{r_1^2} - frac{2006}{r_2^2} ] [ y = frac{2006}{r_1^2} + frac{2006}{r_2^2} - frac{2006}{r_3^2} ] [ z = frac{2006}{r_2^2} + frac{2006}{r_3^2} - frac{2006}{r_1^2} ] 3. **Ensuring (x, y, z) are positive integers:** Since (x, y, z) must be positive integers, the expressions (frac{2006}{r_1^2}), (frac{2006}{r_2^2}), and (frac{2006}{r_3^2}) must be integers. This implies that (r_1, r_2, r_3) must be such that (r_1^2, r_2^2, r_3^2) are divisors of 2006. The prime factorization of 2006 is: [ 2006 = 2 times 17 times 59 ] Therefore, the possible values for (r_1, r_2, r_3) are such that (r_1^2, r_2^2, r_3^2) are divisors of 2006. The possible values for (r_1, r_2, r_3) are 1, (sqrt{2}), (sqrt{17}), (sqrt{59}), (sqrt{34}), (sqrt{118}), (sqrt{1003}), and (sqrt{2006}). 4. **Checking integer solutions:** We need to check which combinations of (r_1, r_2, r_3) yield integer values for (x, y, z). After checking, we find the following valid combinations: - (r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = 1): [ x = y = z = frac{2006}{1^2} = 2006 ] - (r_1 = 1, r_2 = r_3 = 2): [ x = frac{2006}{2^2} + frac{2006}{1^2} - frac{2006}{2^2} = 1003 ] [ y = frac{2006}{1^2} + frac{2006}{2^2} - frac{2006}{2^2} = 1003 ] [ z = frac{2006}{2^2} + frac{2006}{2^2} - frac{2006}{1^2} = 7021 ] - (r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = 3): [ x = y = z = frac{2006}{3^2} = 9027 ] Thus, the solutions are: [ (x, y, z) = (2006, 2006, 2006), (1003, 1003, 7021), (9027, 9027, 9027) ] The final answer is ( boxed{ (2006, 2006, 2006), (1003, 1003, 7021), (9027, 9027, 9027) } )"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},W={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],M={key:0},z={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",W,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
