So we can split the distances in terms of given segments: [ AR = 2 times RN ] - Using the given lengths, RO = 11 and OM = 5: [ AR = 2 times RN quad text{gives us} quad RN = 5, AR = 10 ] - Calculating AO: [ AO^2 = AR^2 + RO^2 ] - Substituting the lengths: [ AO^2 = 10^2 +11^2 = 100 + 121 = 221 quad implies quad AO = sqrt{221} ] 4. **Using Pythagorean Theorem for the segments**: - Since OM = 5, considering the right triangle OMC, we can determine MC. - Using Pythagorean Theorem: [ OC^2 = AO^2 - OM^2 ] [ MC^2 = 221 - 25 = 196 quad Rightarrow quad MC = sqrt{196} = 14 ] 5. **Determining BC**: - Since M is the midpoint: [ BC = 2 times MC = 2 times 14 = 28 ] # Conclusion: The length of BC is, [ boxed{28} ]"},{"prompt":"Compute [ leftlfloor dfrac {1005^3}{1003 cdot 1004} dfrac {1003^3}{1004 cdot 1005} rightrfloor,]where lfloor x rfloor denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.","completion":"Let n = 1004, so the expression becomes [ leftlfloor frac{(n+1)^3}{(n-1)n} - frac{(n-1)^3}{n(n+1)} rightrfloor.] Combining the fractions under the common denominator (n-1)n(n+1), we get [begin{aligned} leftlfloor frac{(n+1)^3}{(n-1)n} - frac{(n-1)^3}{n(n+1)} rightrfloor &= leftlfloor frac{(n+1)^4 - (n-1)^4}{(n-1)n(n+1)} rightrfloor &= leftlfloor frac{(n^4+4n^3+6n^2+4n+1) - (n^4-4n^3+6n^2-4n+1)}{(n-1)n(n+1)} rightrfloor &= leftlfloor frac{8n^3+8n}{(n-1)n(n+1)} rightrfloor &= leftlfloor frac{8n(n^2+1)}{(n-1)n(n+1)} rightrfloor &= leftlfloor frac{8(n^2+1)}{n^2-1} rightrfloor . end{aligned}] Since frac{n^2+1}{n^2-1} is slightly greater than 1, we expect frac{8(n^2+1)}{n^2-1} to be a little greater than 8, resulting in the floor value of boxed{8}.

Since the median and the arithmetic mean are the same, the distribution of the integers is symmetric about the median. The given median is 160, and the greatest integer is 179.

These numbers are perfect squares of two-digit numbers that are four-digit numbers themselves. 1. **Formulate the given problem:** - Each number on a hat is a four-digit perfect square. - Tens digit of these numbers must be zero. - No hat number ends with zero. 2. **Mathematical formulation of the problem:** - Let overline{c b 0 a} be a perfect square (overline{e f})^2, where a neq 0, meaning f neq 0: overline{c b 0 a} = (10e + f)^2 = 100e^2 + 20ef + f^2 3. **Simplify with modulo 100:** - Considering modulo properties: 100e^2 + 20ef + f^2 equiv a (mod 100) - Since tens digit is 0: 20ef + f^2 equiv a (mod 100) 4. **Examine possible f values:** - For 20ef + f^2 to have tens digit as 0, f^2 must have tens place 0 which implies f must be from {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} (since {0, 4, 6} yield only tens digit ending 0 and not applicable). 5. **Analyze e values:** - Following cases ensure that the tens digit of 20ef + f^2 equals 0: - For f = 1, 2, 3: e = 5 yields numbers 51^2=2601, 52^2=2704, 53^2=2809. - For f = 5: 20ef + f^2 = 100e + 25 does not meet tens zero requirement. - For f = 7: e can be 4 or 9, thus numbers 47^2=2209, 97^2=9409. - For f = 8: e can be 4 or 9, thus numbers 48^2=2304, 98^2=9604. - For f = 9: e can be 4 or 9, thus numbers 49^2=2401, 99^2=9801. 6. **Identify possible groups:** - Valid four-digit squares are: {2209, 2809, 9409, 2704, 2304, 9604, 2501, 2401, 9801} - Group by identical unit digits of b=2, 7, 4: {(2209, 2809, 9409), (2704, 2304, 9604), (2501, 2401, 9801)} 7. **Apply logical deductions:** - Since A declares both others' unit digits match: - Confirm matching leading digits. - 8. **Identify the correct group using A, B, C statements:** - B, C conclude their values after A's statement.

The value of n can either equal the number of cells just colored by the other player in their previous move or exceed it by one. The player who cannot make a move loses. Who will win with optimal play from both players?","completion":"Solution: To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the moves and strategies of both players. Let's summarize the problem again: - **Initial Condition:** The game starts on a white 100 times 100 grid. - **First Move:** Petya makes the first move by coloring one cell black. - **Subsequent Moves:** For each subsequent move, a player can color any white vertical or horizontal rectangle 1 times n where n is a natural number. The rectangle must either match the number of cells just colored by the other player or exceed it by one. - **Winning Condition:** The player who cannot make a move loses the game. 1. **Initial Observation:** - Petya starts by coloring one cell (let's denote it by P_1 = 1). - The game's symmetry plays a significant role because the grid has an even size, 100 times 100. Vasya can leverage this symmetry. 2. **Symmetry Argument:** - Vasya can adopt a strategy where every time Petya colors a section of the grid, Vasya colors a section symmetrically opposite relative to the center of the grid. - If Petya colors a cell at position (i, j), Vasya can color the cell at position (100-i, 100-j). - Due to symmetry, after each of Vasya's moves, the position on the grid remains symmetric relative to its center. 3. **Advantages of the Symmetric Strategy:** - If Vasya always makes a move that maintains the symmetry relative to the center of the grid, he ensures that after each of his moves, a valid move always remains for him as long as there is a move for Petya. - The crucial aspect of this strategy is that Vasya mirrors Petya’s move in a symmetric fashion, which is always possible as long as there’s space to move, ensuring a counter move till the end of the game. 4. **Final Argument:** - Given this symmetric strategy, Vasya can always respond to Petya's moves. When the grid becomes sufficiently filled, Petya will eventually face a situation where any move he makes will be immediately mirrored by Vasya. - The symmetry ensures that Petya is forced into a position where he will be the first to be unable to make a legal move. # Conclusion: By adopting a symmetric strategy, Vasya ensures that Petya will be the first player to run out of moves, and thus Vasya will win the game with correct play from both sides.

Since by the inductive hypothesis, this holds for ( n-1 ), and combining the term ( a_n - a_i ) (which adds another divisible term if ( a_n equiv a_i mod k )), we conclude for ( n ). By the lemma, since the number of terms ( left(a_j - a_iright) ) divisible by any ( k ) is at least as many as ( (j - i) ) divisible by ( k ), we conclude: [ prod_{1 leq i < j leq n} (j - i) mid prod_{1 leq i < j leq n} left( a_j - a_i right) ] Thus, the original statement is proven. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Consider a region laid out as a network of many congruent equilateral triangles, where each side of the triangle is a road and each vertex is an intersection, with 6 roads meeting at each intersection.

Given that the cars start traveling in the direction ( vec{e}_{1} ), it is clear from the problem setup that any travel progression can be broken into contributions along ( vec{e}_{1}, vec{e}_{2}, vec{e}_{3} ). 2. **Existence of Non-Intersection Paths**: In our network, each car can at any intersection either proceed straight, turn left, or turn right by ( 120^circ ).

One part contains the tree, and the other part contains the vertices ( A_i ) between ( A_m ) and ( A_n ). 6. **Vertex Replacement:** Replace the vertices ( A_i ) (including ( A_m ), ( A_n ), and ( B )) with a single new vertex. This operation reduces the graph while maintaining the structure that each face shares an edge with the outer face. 7. **Inductive Step:** By induction, the reduced graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. When ( k ) becomes 1 or 2, the graph trivially has a Hamiltonian cycle. 8. **Conclusion:** Since the reduced graph has a Hamiltonian cycle, the original graph also has a Hamiltonian cycle. This cycle corresponds to a simple closed polygon that passes through all vertices of the polyhedron ( P ).

The set ( W = {1, 2, cdots, 2p} ) therefore is the union of ( U ) and ( V ), i.e., ( W = U cup V ). 2. **Number of Subsets:** - We need to find the number of ( p )-element subsets ( A ) of ( W ) such that: 1. ( |A| = p ). 2. The sum of the elements in ( A ) is divisible by ( p ). 3. **Combinatorics and Basic Sets:** - The total number of ( p )-element subsets of ( W ) is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{2p}{p} ] - Among these subsets, sets ( U ) and ( V ) both satisfy the given conditions. Since both ( U ) and ( V ) are disjoint, they contribute distinct solutions. 4. **Classifying Subsets:** - Any ( p )-element subset of ( W ) other than ( U ) and ( V ) must intersect both ( U ) and ( V ). 5. **Forming Classes Based on Sum Modulo ( p ):** - Let ( S ) and ( T ) be different ( p )-element subsets of ( W ), not equal to ( U ) or ( V ), and satisfying the conditions. - If ( S cap V = T cap V ), then each subset can be distinguished by the modular difference in elements chosen from ( U ). 6. **Analyzing via Modular Arithmetic:** - Consider subsets ( S cap U = {s_1, s_2, ldots, s_m} ) and ( T cap U = {t_1, t_2, ldots, t_m} ). - Let ( s_i - t_i equiv k pmod{p} ) for a suitable ( k ). - If ( sum_{i=1}^p s_i - sum_{i=1}^p t_i equiv (k_1 - k_2) m pmod{p} ), the sums differ by a non-zero multiple of ( p ), ensuring they form different classes.

Our goal is to determine whether there exists an arithmetic sequence a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ldots where none of the terms is divisible by a square greater than 1. 2. **Choosing an Appropriate Prime:** Choose a prime number p such that p does not divide the difference d. This can be done because there are infinitely many prime numbers. 3. **Forming the Sequence Modulo (p^2):** Consider the first p^2 terms of the sequence: [ a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ldots, a+(p^2-1)d ] When these terms are taken modulo (p^2), they must yield distinct residues. This is because: - Suppose 0 leq l < k leq p^2 - 1, and consider the difference: [ (a + kd) - (a + ld) = (k - l)d ] - Since (p nmid d) by our choice, the product ((k-l)d) can only be divisible by (p^2) if ((k-l)) were divisible by (p^2). However, (0 < k-l < p^2), so this is impossible. 4. **Existence of Zero Residues:** Given that there are (p^2) distinct residues modulo (p^2), one of these residues must be zero (the pigeonhole principle). Therefore, at least one of the terms (a, a+d, a+2d, ldots, a+(p^2-1)d) must be divisible by (p^2). 5. **Conclusion:** As (p) was chosen to be an arbitrary prime, it follows that no arithmetic sequence of distinct positive integers can exist such that none of its terms is divisible by a square greater than 1. Thus, no such sequence exists. blacksquare 2: 1. **Setting Up the Problem:** We need to examine whether the number a + nd can have a square divisor greater than 1. 2. **Specific Choice of ( n ):** Suppose ( n = a(d+2) ). Then: [ a + a(d+2)d = a[1 + d^2 + 2d] ] 3. **Simplification:** - Expanding and simplifying the right-hand side: [ a[1 + d^2 + 2d] = a(d+1)^2 ] - This result indicates a + a(d+2)d includes a term which is square of (d+1) which implies a square greater than 1. Conclusion from Solution 2 reinforces that an arithmetic sequence free from elements divisible by squares greater than 1 cannot exist owing to inherent multiplicative properties in the sequence related to squares of the difference plus the first term. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Calen originally had 5 more pencils than does Caleb, and Caleb has 3 less than twice as many pencils as does Candy.

Alphonse goes first. (a) Suppose ( m = 2^{40} ) and ( n = 3^{51} ). Determine which player is always able to win the game and explain the winning strategy. (b) Suppose ( m = 2^{40} ) and ( n = 2^{51} ). Determine which player is always able to win the game and explain the winning strategy.","completion":"Part (a) 1. **Initial Setup**: Let's consider the initial setup where ( m = 2^{40} ) and ( n = 3^{51} ). 2. **Transformation**: Instead of dealing with the actual numbers, we consider the number of prime factors they have. This transforms the numbers: - ( 2^{40} ) becomes 40 because it has 40 factors of the prime 2. - ( 3^{51} ) becomes 51 because it has 51 factors of the prime 3. 3. **Equivalent Simplified Game**: We now view the game as follows: two numbers ( a = 40 ) and ( b = 51 ) are on the board. On each turn, a player can replace a number ( k ) with any positive integer less than ( k ). 4. **Winning and Losing Positions**: By examining this simplified game: - The pair ( (0, 1) ) is a losing position because the player to move has no valid choices (can't reduce 1 or increase 0). - The pair ( (0, n geq 2) ) is a winning position: the player can replace ( n ) with 1, resulting in the pair ( (0, 1) ). 5. **General Strategy**: If moving from ( k ) to ( k-1 ) maintains the move non-losing: - ( (k, k) ) is a losing position since any move would make the positions unequal. - ( (k, n > k) ) is a winning position since moving ( n ) to ( k ) creates a ( (k, k) ) position. 6. **Induction Argument**: Using induction: - For ( k geq 2, (k, k) ) is a losing position, while ( (k, n geq k+1) ) is a winning position. 7. **Specific Case**: For ( m = 2^{40} ) and ( n = 3^{51} ): - We are in case ( (40, 51) ) which follows ( (40, 41) ). - Since ( 51 > 40 ), it corresponds to the winning position for the first player. **Conclusion**: Alphonse can always win. (boxed{text{Alphonse wins}}) Part (b) 1. **Initial Setup**: Consider ( m = 2^{40} ) and ( n = 2^{51} ). 2. **Common Divisors**: Both numbers are powers of 2, hence throughout the game only powers of 2 will appear. 3. **Key Observation**: - The player who writes a number (leq 2) first will lose: - If they write 1, the other writes 2 and wins. - If they write 2, the other writes 1 and wins. 4. **Generalization**: Extending this pattern: - The player who reduces a number ( leq 2^{2k-1} ) is likely to lose. - For each stage power of 2, the opponent adjusts with a power of 2 that leads to a losing position. 5. **Induction Argument**: By induction: - Whenever numbers exceed ( 2^{2k-1} ), forcing the other player to reduce below this gives a losing position for the first player who does so. 6. **Specific Strategy**: Since ( n = 2^{51} ), Alphonse can ensure that Beryl has a number (leq 2^{39}): - Replace ( 2^{51} ) with ( 2^{41} ). **Conclusion**: Alphonse can make a winning move on his first turn.

Now express x^{2}+2y in terms of theta: x^{2}+2y = (2costheta)^{2}+2bsintheta = 4cos^{2}theta + 2bsintheta = f(theta).

We need to find the minimum number of weighings required to determine the heaviest coin. **Solution using Induction:** We will show that we can determine the heaviest coin in ( 2n - 1 ) weighings. We prove this statement by induction on ( n ). 1. **Base Case ( (n = 2) ):** - Given two coins and three balances, perform two weighings: 1. Weigh the two coins on the first balance. 2. Weigh the two coins on the second balance. - If the readings of any balance are equal, such balance is spoiled, and we can then use the third balance to identify the heavier coin correctly, since this measurement will not be random for two coins. - If no balance results in equal weights, at least one coin should indicate heavier two times across the two weighings (considering one balance may be spoiled). This coin is the heavier one. Therefore, for ( n = 2 ), we determine the heaviest coin in ( 2 times 2 - 1 = 3 ) weighings. 2. **Inductive Step ( (n geq 3) ):** - Assume the statement is true for ( k ) coins, i.e., for ( k ) coins we need ( 2k - 1 ) weighings to determine the heaviest coin. - For ( k + 1 ) coins, proceed as follows: - Choose any two coins and any two balances. - Perform two weighings: 1.

Weigh the first coin against the second coin on the second balance. - Possible cases based on these two weighings: 1. **If any balance shows equal weights:** This balance is spoiled. Disregard this balance. 2. **If both balances show unequal weights:** One balance correctly identifies the heavier coin, but we cannot be sure which balance is correct. Still, we proceed by considering both coins equally probable to be the heaviest among initially weighed coins. - Set aside the coin identified as heavier (or keep both if uncertain). - After these first two operations, consider the remaining ( k - 1 ) coins and the previously identified heaviest coin, and apply the induction hypothesis to these ( k ) coins with the available weighings. - According to the induction hypothesis, we need ( 2k - 1 ) additional weighings for these ( k ) coins.

What is the ratio of machine B's rate to machine A's rate?","completion":"Let's denote the rate at which machine A works as A caps per hour and the rate at which machine B works as B caps per hour. Since machine A can complete the job in 8 hours, we can say that the total work (W) is equal to 8A. Now, machine A works for 6 hours, so the work done by machine A is 6A. The remaining work to be done by machine B is W - 6A. Since W is equal to 8A, the remaining work is 8A - 6A, which is 2A. Machine B takes 8 hours to complete this remaining work, so we can write the equation for machine B's work as 8B = 2A. To find the ratio of machine B's rate to machine A's rate, we need to find B/A. We can rearrange the equation to solve for B: 8B = 2A B = 2A / 8 B = A / 4 So, the ratio of machine B's rate to machine A's rate is B/A = (A/4) / A = 1/4.

For x in (-infty, -3), since f(x) is increasing and f(-3) = 0, then f(x) < 0. 2. For x in (-3, 0), since f(x) is increasing, then f(x) > 0. Furthermore, as f(x) is an odd function: 1. For x in (0, 3), by the property of odd functions (f(-x) = -f(x)), we have f(x) < 0. 2. For x in (3, +infty), since f(x) is the negative reflection across the y-axis of f(x) for x in (-infty, -3), then f(x) > 0. Now, considering g(x) = x^2 + x + 1, observe that: 1.

There are no additional posts needed for these junctions. 5. **Summation of total posts**: - 9 posts along the 80 m side. - 2 instances of 6 posts for each 50 m side, totaling 12 posts. - Subtracting 2 posts because they are shared at the junctions: 12 + 9 - 2 = 19 posts. 6. **Conclusion**: The total number of posts required to fence the given area with the specifications provided and installing a gate is 19.

From the problem, we have two conditions: 1. Xiao Ming spent the same amount of money on both purchases, but got 0.5kg more the second time. This implies that the cost for 1kg at the first purchase price is equal to the cost for 1.5kg at the second purchase price. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: x = 1.5y 2. Xiao Liang bought the same weight (2kg) both times but spent 10 yuan less the second time. This means the difference in cost for 2kg between the first and second purchase prices is 10 yuan. In equation form, this is: 2x - 2y = 10 Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: - From the first equation, we can express x in terms of y: x = 1.5y. - Substituting x = 1.5y into the second equation gives us 2(1.5y) - 2y = 10, which simplifies to 3y - 2y = 10, hence y = 10. - Substituting y = 10 back into x = 1.5y gives us x = 1.5 times 10 = 15.

For Xiao Liang: - The total cost for both purchases is 15 times 2 yuan and 10 times 2 yuan, respectively. - The total weight bought is 2 + 2 kg. - The average price is frac{15 times 2 + 10 times 2}{2+2} = frac{30 + 20}{4} = frac{50}{4} = 12.5 yuan/kg. boxed{text{The average prices for Xiao Ming and Xiao Liang are 12 yuan/kg and 12.5 yuan/kg, respectively.}} Part 3: Recommendation on Buying Strategy Since the average price for Xiao Ming (who spent the same amount of money on both purchases) is lower than that for Xiao Liang (who bought the same weight both times), it is more cost-effective to buy the same amount of money. boxed{text{money}}"},{"prompt":"There were 9 girls and some boys trying out for the school's basketball team.

Since ( triangle HBC ) and ( triangle ECD ) share the angle ( angle ECD ) and have equal sides: - ( HB = EC ) - ( BC = DC ) - They are thus congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion. - Consequently, ( triangle EHC ) is an isosceles right triangle, implying ( angle EHC = 45^circ ). - Given this, we have ( angle DEB = angle DGC = 180^circ - angle EHC = 135^circ ). 4. Therefore, since we have proved that: - ( DE = DE ) (common side) - ( EG = EB ) (sides of the square) - ( angle DEG = angle DEB ) (both being ( 135^circ )) 5. By the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) criterion, ( triangle DEG cong triangle DEB ). 6. Hence, corresponding sides ( DG ) and ( DB ) must be equal. 7. Therefore, triangle ( triangle BDG ) is isosceles, as it has two equal sides ( DG = DB ).

The speed of the train is given in kilometers per hour (kmph), so we need to convert it to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the platform length and the time taken. The conversion factor from kmph to m/s is: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 72 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 20 m/s Now, we know the train crosses the platform in 26 seconds at a speed of 20 m/s. The distance covered while crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 20 m/s * 26 s = 520 meters This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform. We are given the length of the platform as 230 meters, so we can find the length of the train by subtracting the platform length from the total distance covered.

Thus, (X_1) lies on the polar of (F') with respect to (odot(ABCD)). 4. **Self-Orthogonality Lemma:** - By the Self-Orthogonality Lemma, (omega_1 perp odot(ABCD)). - Therefore, (OY cdot OF' = R^2) where (R) is the circumradius of (odot(ABCD)). - Similarly, (OX cdot OE' = R^2). 5. **Inversion Consideration:** - Consider an inversion ((Psi)) around (odot(ABCD)). - (Psi) swaps ({S, (overline{O-I-S}) cap EF}) (by Brocard), ({F', Y}), ({E', X}), and ({A, M}) remains fixed. - Thus, (Psi) swaps ({odot(OS), EF}), ({odot(OAM), AM}), and ({odot(OXY), E'F'}). 6. **Equivalent Problem:** - The problem becomes equivalent to proving that (EF, AM, E'F') concur in a bicentric quadrilateral (ABCD) with incenter (I). 7. **Concurrency Proof:** - Let (EF cap E'F' = T) and (TA cap {odot(ABCD), IE} = {M', K}). - Using the cross-ratio, (-1 = (E, E'; K, I) overset{A}{=} (B, D; M', AI cap odot(ABCD))). - Notice that (AI cap odot(ABCD)) is the midpoint of (widehat{BCD}). - Hence, (M') must be the midpoint of the minor arc (BD), implying (M' equiv M). - Therefore, (EF, AM, E'F') are concurrent. 8. **Conclusion:** - Inverting back, we get that ({odot(OXY), odot(OAM), odot(OS)}) are coaxial.

When Pipe A is filling the tank without the leak, it takes 12 hours to fill the tank. Therefore, the rate of Pipe A is ( frac{1}{12} ) of the tank per hour. When Pipe A is filling the tank with the leak, it takes 18 hours to fill the tank. Therefore, the combined rate of Pipe A and the leak is ( frac{1}{18} ) of the tank per hour. We can set up the following equation to represent the situation when the tank is being filled with the leak present: [ A - L = frac{1}{18} ] We know that ( A = frac{1}{12} ), so we can substitute that into the equation: [ frac{1}{12} - L = frac{1}{18} ] Now, we solve for ( L ): [ L = frac{1}{12} - frac{1}{18} ] To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36 in this case: [ L = frac{3}{36} - frac{2}{36} ] [ L = frac{1}{36} ] This means the leak empties the tank at a rate of ( frac{1}{36} ) of the tank per hour. To find out how long it would take for the leak to empty the full tank, we take the reciprocal of the leak's rate: [ text{Time taken by the leak to empty the tank} = frac{1}{L} ] [ text{Time taken by the leak to empty the tank} = frac{1}{frac{1}{36}} ] [ text{Time taken by the leak to empty the tank} = 36 text{ hours} ] So, the leak alone can empty the full tank in boxed{36} hours."},{"prompt":"Every day, 12 tons of potatoes are delivered to the city using one type of transport from three collective farms.

How should the order for the supply of 12 tons be distributed among the farms so that the total cost of the potatoes delivered to the city is minimized?","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to build a mathematical model and find the cheapest way to distribute the order for 12 tons of potatoes among three collective farms. The prices and constraints for each farm are given. Let's denote: - ( x_1 ): Tons of potatoes from the first collective farm (I). - ( x_2 ): Tons of potatoes from the second collective farm (II). - ( x_3 ): Tons of potatoes from the third collective farm (III).

The domain for the non-negativity constraints ( x_1 geq 0 ), ( x_2 geq 0 ), ( x_3 geq 0 ) lies in the positive coordinate planes. Constraints ( x_1 leq 10 ), ( x_2 leq 8 ), and ( x_3 leq 6 ) define a rectangular parallelepiped. The additional constraint ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 12 ) imposes a plane cutting through this prism. Further, the constraint ( x_1 + 4x_2 + 3x_3 leq 40 ) delimits the region further, intersecting the given plane. The feasible region coincides with a geometric polytope within this space, bounded by the intersections of these planes and lines. 2. **Finding Intersection Points**: The feasible region can be determined by finding the points of intersection for the constraints. Here's how we compute these points: For point ( P_3 ): - ( x_3 = 6 ) - ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 12 ) - ( x_2 = 0 ) Solving, we get: [ x_1 + 0 + 6 = 12 implies x_1 = 6 ] Therefore, ( P_3 = (6, 0, 6) ). 3. **Evaluating the Cost Function**: Calculate the cost at each vertex of this polyhedron region: For ( P_3 ): [ boxed{F(P_3) = 4 cdot 6 + 3 cdot 0 + 1 cdot 6 = 24 + 6 = 30 text{ (rubles)}} ] 4. **Continuing for other critical intersection points**: Take point ( P_4 ): - ( x_3 = 6 ) - ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 12 ) - ( x_1 + 4x_2 + 3x_3 = 40 ) Solving this system: [ begin{aligned} & x_1 + x_2 + 6 = 12 implies x_1 + x_2 = 6 & x_1 + 4x_2 + 18 = 40 implies x_1 + 4x_2 = 22 end{aligned} ] Subtracting these equations: [ begin{aligned} &(x_1 + 4x_2) - (x_1 + x_2) = 22 - 6 &3x_2 = 16 implies x_2 = frac{16}{3}, quad x_1 = 6 - frac{16}{3} = frac{2}{3} end{aligned} ] Hence, the coordinates are ( P_4 left( frac{2}{3}, frac{16}{3}, 6 right) ).

We are to find (x). 1. **Identify the Factors**: - Since (x) is even, one of its prime divisors is 2. We need to find all (x) that have exactly two odd prime divisors, one of which is 11. - Thus, (x) can be written as (x = 11 times text{another odd prime} times 2^k). 2. **Rewriting the Equation**: - Divisibility by 11 means (7^n equiv -1 pmod{11}). - The order of 7 modulo 11 is 5, meaning (7^5 equiv 1 pmod{11}). - From this, (n) must be a multiple of 5, i.e., (n = 5m) where (m) is some odd natural number. Therefore, (x = 7^{5m} + 1). 3. **Factoring Using Sum of Geometric Progression**: [ x = 7^{5m} + 1 = (7^m + 1)(7^{4m} - 7^{3m} + 7^{2m} - 7^m + 1) ] Let (p = 7^m + 1) and (q = 7^{4m} - 7^{3m} + 7^{2m} - 7^m + 1). 4. **Checking Coprimeness**: - Notice that (p) and (q) are coprime. - Suppose there is a common divisor (r), then: [ r | (7^m + 1) ] [ r | (7^{4m} - 7^{3m} + 7^{2m} - 7^m + 1) ] Hence, combining these expressions, we get: [ r | q - (7^m + 1)(remaining terms) ] - This leads to (r) being a divisor of the coefficients involved. 5. **Proving (p) as a Power of Two**: - Assume (p = 7^m + 1 = 2^k). - For (m = 1), (7^1 + 1 = 8 = 2^3), and (x = 7^5 + 1 = 16808 = 2^3 times 11 times 191). 6. **Excluding Larger (m)**: - For (m > 1), assume (7^m + 1 = 2^s). - Since (m) is odd and (7^{odd} equiv some residual cycle pmod{16}), this (s) leads to contradictions in higher powers. - Thus, only valid case is for (m = 1), yielding (x = 16808). # Conclusion: [ boxed{16808} ]"},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(2cos x,1) and overrightarrow{b}=( sqrt {3}sin x+cos x,1), let the function be f(x)= overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}.

Since x is in the interval left[0, frac{pi}{4}right], the angle 2x+frac{pi}{6} will be in the interval left[frac{pi}{6}, frac{2pi}{3}right]. Therefore, the range of 2sin left(2x+ frac{pi}{6}right) is between frac{1}{2} and 1. Hence, we find that: [ f_{text{max}}(x)=2 quad text{and} quad f_{text{min}}(x)=1. ] Thus, the maximum value is boxed{2} and the minimum value is boxed{1}. (2) Given f(x_0)= frac{6}{5}, we have 2sin left(2x_0+ frac{pi}{6}right)= frac{6}{5}. From this, it follows that sin left(2x_0+ frac{pi}{6}right)= frac{3}{5}. Since x_0 is in the interval left[frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}right], the angle 2x_0+frac{pi}{6} will be in the interval left[frac{2pi}{3}, frac{7pi}{6}right].

The inequalities become: [ 6k_0+1geq 4omega quad text{and} quad 3k_0leq 1+omega. ] Since omega > 0, it follows that k_0 > -frac{1}{6}. Also, considering the length of the intervals: [ frac{2pi}{3}-frac{pi}{3}leq frac{1}{2}-frac{pi}{2omega}, ] we find 0 < omegaleq frac{3}{2}. Hence, k_0leq frac{5}{6}, so - frac{1}{6} < k_0leq frac{5}{6}. This implies k_0=0, and therefore, the range of omega is 0 < omegaleq frac{1}{4}.

He has 30 liters of milk at Rs. 18 per liter. Total cost of pure milk = 30 liters * Rs. 18/liter = Rs. 540 Now, the milkman mixes 5 liters of water with 20 liters of pure milk. This means he still has 10 liters of pure milk that he hasn't mixed with water. The total volume of the mixture (milk + water) is now 20 liters of milk + 5 liters of water = 25 liters. Since the water is freely available, it doesn't add any cost to the milkman. Therefore, the cost of the mixture is the same as the cost of the 20 liters of pure milk. Cost of 20 liters of pure milk = 20 liters * Rs. 18/liter = Rs. 360 The milkman sells the entire 25 liters of mixture at the cost price of pure milk, which is Rs. 18 per liter.

Let's denote the complete circumference of the circle as 360^circ. 2. **Step 2: Ensure Coverage** According to the problem, these arcs can overlap, but none of them covers the circle entirely. Hence, each point on the circle belongs to at least one arc, but some points may belong to more than one arc. 3. **Step 3: Partition the Circle** The endpoints of these arcs segment the circle into several smaller parts. Consider the partition points of these arcs, and ensure that these are the smallest possible segments, meaning each segment does not contain any endpoints of arcs within it. Each of these smallest segments is covered by at least one arc. 4. **Step 4: Excess Coverage Analysis** Suppose any of these smallest segments are covered by three or more arcs. We will choose two of these arcs that extend the farthest in either direction (clockwise and counterclockwise). If there is just one arc covering the segment, we take that single arc. This approach ensures that all points within any segment are covered by no more than two arcs. 5. **Step 5: Iterative Reduction** Perform the above selection iteratively for all smallest segments around the circumference of the circle. After sufficient iteration, we will reach a configuration where every point on the circle is covered by at most two arcs. 6. **Step 6: Calculate the Total Degree** Given that initially, each point was covered by potentially more than two arcs, and since we are reducing the number of arcs such that no point on the circle is covered by more than two arcs, the new total degree covered by the arcs should not exceed: [ 2 times 360^circ = 720^circ ] # Conclusion: By following the steps above, we can ensure that the circle is entirely covered by selecting arcs so that the sum of their measures is no more than 720^circ.

To prove the problem statement, we first utilize the result from problem 8.7, which helps us understand the division of the polyhedron's surface into zones. 2. Each \\"zone\\" in the polyhedron divides the surface of the polyhedron into two \\"caps\\". Given that the polyhedron is centrally symmetric, both \\"caps\\" contain an equal number of faces. Let us elaborate on this reasoning. 3. Let ( k ) be the number of different \\"zones\\" in the polyhedron. Each face of the polyhedron is a parallelogram. 4. Considering the general structure of this polyhedron, each \\"zone\\" intersects with ( k-1 ) other \\"zones\\". This means each \\"zone\\" contains exactly ( 2(k-1) ) faces. This idea is grounded in symmetry and how faces intersect within these zones. As each face is a parallelogram, intersections are well-defined along edges. 5. Note that since each face in the polyhedron is a parallelogram, it is shared by exactly two \\"zones\\". Therefore, when summing up the total count of faces, we must account for the double counting of each face. 6. Hence, the total number of faces ( F ) can be calculated by noting that each face appears in two \\"zones\\": [ F = frac{2(k-1)k}{2} = (k-1)k ] 7.

Assume without loss of generality that Amin's first move is to consider the top-left cell and color all cells in the left-most column red.

This table now has one row red and a column with all cells white except one, which is red. - Assume without loss of generality that the red row is the top-most row and the mentioned column is the left-most one. - We need to show that Amin can color the remaining ( (n-1) times (n-1) ) table red. - Note that Amin could color the original ( n times n ) table. In the left-most column, there is only one red cell, and the others are white. Amin couldn't use that column's cell except the top-most one. Similarly, he couldn't use the top-most row's cells except the left-most one since that top-left cell was black. - Therefore, Amin should apply his moves on the remaining ( (n-1) times (n-1) ) table and the top-left cell. - By the induction hypothesis, Ali can color the remaining ( (n-1) times (n-1) ) table, and his moves will cover the whole left-most column, making the entire table red.

Let's go through the solution step by step. 1. **Understanding Relatively Prime Numbers**: If ( a ) and ( b ) are relatively prime, then for any integer ( N > ab ), we can express ( N ) as ( N = ra + sb ) for some positive integers ( r ) and ( s ). This follows from the linear combination of ( a ) and ( b ). 2. **Explanation with Incongruent Residues**: Suppose ( a > b ). Consider the sequence ( N, N - b, N - 2b, ldots, N - (a-1)b ). These numbers are all positive and they are incongruent modulo ( a ), which means they form a complete set of residues modulo ( a ). Hence, one of these must be congruent to 0 modulo ( a ). In other words, some ( k ) exists such that ( N - kb ) is divisible by ( a ). 3. **Tiling Specific Cases**: - **( 35 times 5 ) and ( 35 times 7 ) using ( 5 times 7 ) rectangles**: Since 5 and 7 are relatively prime, we can tile any ( 35 times n ) rectangle for ( n > 35 ) using ( 35 times 5 ) and ( 35 times 7 ) rectangles. This is due to the fact that any integer ( n ) can be written in the form ( 35 = k cdot 5 + s cdot 7 ) for some appropriate ( k ) and ( s ). - **( 24 times 4 ) and ( 24 times 6 ) using ( 4 times 6 ) rectangles**: 4 and 6 have a greatest common divisor of 2. We can tile any ( 24 times 2n ) rectangle for ( n > 24 ) using ( 24 times 4 ) and ( 24 times 6 ). This follows because ( n ) can be reduced to the necessary base tiling length multiples and extended by combining tiles properly. 4. **Constructing Larger Rectangles**: - Since 24 and 35 are relatively prime, for any ( 2n > 48 ) and ( m > 840 ), we can use ( 35 times 2n ) and ( 24 times 2n ) rectangles to tile any ( m times 2n ) rectangle. 5. **Odd-Length Sides**: - Given any ( m times (2n+1) ) rectangle with ( 2n+1 > 83 ) and ( m > 840 ), we can split it into an ( m times 35 ) rectangle and an ( m times 2n ) rectangle.

Now, if B is used for half the time and A and B are used together for the other half, we can set up the following equation: (1/40 * T/2) + (1/24 * T/2) = 1 (since the tanker is filled completely) Multiplying both sides by 120 to clear the fractions, we get: (3 * T/2) + (5 * T/2) = 120 Combining like terms, we get: (3T + 5T) / 2 = 120 8T = 240 T = 240 / 8 T = 30 So, it will take boxed{30} minutes to fill the tanker if B is used for half the time and A and B are used together for the other half."},{"prompt":"f two positive numbers are in the ratio 1 / (6x) : 1 / (5y^2), and the sum of the numbers is such that 2x + 3y = 42, then by what percent is the second number more than the first?","completion":"Let's denote the two positive numbers as A and B, where A is in the ratio of 1 / (6x) and B is in the ratio of 1 / (5y^2).

For any pair of mutually attacking kings, mark the vertices of the squares they occupy. For each such pair, we mark at least six vertices. This is because two adjacent squares share exactly one side, which leads to four shared vertices and two additional vertices on the unshared sides. 3.

We need m such that exactly frac{1}{2} of S is below this line. 3. **Estimating m Using Geometry**: Let’s consider a middle point (x, y) such that it might fit this proportion. Logic suggests trying values around the midpoint of the x-range. If x = 25, then y should be half of the maximum possible y value minus 5 (due to y-intercept).

This is because shifting to the right means that every point on the parabola moves 3 units to the right along the x-axis. Thus, the equation becomes: [ y = (x - 3)^2 ] 2. **Shifting the Parabola Up by 4 Units:** After the rightward shift, the next transformation is shifting the parabola up by 4 units. Shifting a graph up or down involves adding or subtracting a constant from the y-value. Since we are shifting up, we add 4 to the equation obtained from step 1.

Here is a detailed step-by-step solution to find the count of \\"good numbers\\": 1. **Identify the range and the multiples of 3:** Since we are dealing with two-digit numbers, the range of (overline{ab}) is from 10 to 99. Find the multiples of 3 within this range: [ leftlfloor frac{99}{3} rightrfloor - 3 = 33 - 3 = 30 ] This calculation tells us there are 30 multiples of 3 in the range ([10, 99]). 2. **Special cases removal:** Among these multiples, the numbers 30, 60, and 90 need to be discarded because they include digits that don't satisfy the requirement (a > 0) and (b > 0) properly in respect to the problem's specific \\"good number\\" condition. So, we remove these 3 special cases: [ 30 - 3 = 27 ] There are 27 valid multiples of 3 left. 3. **Considering digits (a) and (b) within {2, 4, 6, 8}:** When (a) and (b) are from the set ({2, 4, 6, 8}) and (3 times (a + b)) holds, we analyze the possibilities: - (a, b in {2, 4, 6, 8}) There are 11 such combinations where (overline{ab}) forms a \\"good number\\". 4. **Considering (a = b):** When (a = b), imply the digits where (overline{ab}) and ( overline{a} ) would still satisfy the condition with common factor 2 or 3 respectively.

Substituting this into the formula for s in set S, we get: [s = 2(2k) + 1 = 4k + 1] This shows that when n is even, elements generated by s=2n+1 can also be represented as 4k+1, which matches the form of elements in set T. 2. **When n is odd:** Let's express an odd n as n=2k+1, where kin mathbb{Z}.

From this analysis, we see that only the elements of the form 4k+1 (which occur when n is even) are common to both S and T. Therefore, all elements of T (since all elements of T are of the form 4n+1) are included in S when considering the elements generated by even n in S. However, not all elements of S are in T because S also includes elements of the form 4k+3 (which are not in T). Thus, the intersection of S and T includes all elements of T but not all elements of S.

Consider another plane (P_2) that passes through (CD) and is perpendicular to (P_1). 4. **Examine Intersection with Perpendicular Plane**: - The plane (P_2) intersects (B) in such a way that it also forms a disk. The boundary of this disk intersects the circle defined by (CD). Therefore, the intersection of (P_2) with (B) must be a circle which passes through (C) and (D). 5. **Verify Diameter of the Circle in the Perpendicular Plane**: - Since (CD) is taken as a diameter in (P_1), in (P_2) it must also serve as a diameter for the intersection disk.

This gives us three equal segments on BH. 3. **Intersection of the angle bisector:** Let the angle bisector of angle A intersect BH at point K. 4. **Using the Angle Bisector Theorem:** From the properties of the angle bisector in triangle ABH, using the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have [ frac{BK}{KH} = frac{AB}{AH} > 1. ] This implies that point K divides BH in a ratio greater than 1, meaning (K) must lie closer to B than to H. Given our division of BH, the point K is positioned at G. 5. **Analyzing confusion with the median:** Now, consider the median AM from vertex A to the midpoint M of side BC. Since K is at G, the median AM would have to pass through point F. Similarly, point M, the midpoint of BC, would lie on segment BL where FL parallel AC. 6. **Contradiction with Thales' Theorem:** However, according to Thales' theorem, the segment BL parallel to AC must be such that: [ frac{BL}{BC} = frac{BF}{BH} = frac{1}{3}. ] But, this is a contradiction, because for the median AM to pass through F, it would imply M lies on BL in a way that does not match the division ratios provided. 7. **Conclusion:** The earlier contradiction implies that the angle bisector and median, both originating from vertex A, cannot divide the height BH into three equal parts.

What is the minimum number of sticks to be deleted so that the remaining sticks do not form any rectangle?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: Consider an 8 times 8 chessboard. Each grid square has 4 edges, but each edge is shared between two adjacent squares. Therefore, the total number of edges (sticks) on the chessboard is calculated as follows: [ text{Total number of horizontal edges} = 8 times 9 = 72 ] [ text{Total number of vertical edges} = 9 times 8 = 72 ] [ text{Total number of edges} = 72 + 72 = 144 ] 2. **Objective**: We need to delete the minimum number of sticks such that no four corners of any rectangle on the chessboard are connected by the remaining sticks. 3. **Graph Theory Insight**: Consider the chessboard as a graph where each grid square is a vertex and each stick is an edge. The problem translates to ensuring that no four vertices form a cycle (which would correspond to a rectangle). 4. **Block Formation**: When a stick is deleted, it effectively separates the chessboard into blocks. A block is defined as a set of grid squares that are connected by the remaining sticks. 5. **Minimum Deletion Requirement**: According to a theorem in graph theory, a connected graph with ( n ) vertices must have at least ( n-1 ) edges. Therefore, if a block contains ( n ) grid squares, it must have at least ( n-1 ) deleted sticks to ensure it remains connected and does not form a rectangle. 6. **Block Size and Stick Deletion**: For a block of size ( n ), the number of deleted sticks must be at least ( n-1 ). This is because each block must be connected and free of cycles (rectangles). 7. **Calculation of Minimum Deletions**: To avoid rectangles, we need to ensure that the total number of deleted sticks is sufficient to break all potential cycles. The critical observation is that the number of deleted sticks in a block must be at least ( frac{2}{3} ) of the number of grid squares in that block. This is derived from the fact that each block must be connected and free of cycles. 8. **Total Minimum Deletions**: Given the entire chessboard has ( 8 times 8 = 64 ) grid squares, the total number of deleted sticks must be at least: [ text{Total minimum deletions} geq 64 times frac{2}{3} = 42 frac{2}{3} ] Since the number of deleted sticks must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number: [ text{Total minimum deletions} geq 43 ] The final answer is ( boxed{ 43 } )"},{"prompt":"Find the equation of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = xe^x at the point (0, f(0)) ( ).

Recall the trigonometric identity for cos^2(x): [ cos^2(x) = frac{1}{1 + tan^2(x)} ] 3. Using the double-angle formula for cosine, we have: [ cos(2alpha_n) = 2cos^2(alpha_n) - 1 ] 4. Substitute cos^2(alpha_n) using the identity: [ cos^2(alpha_n) = frac{1}{1 + tan^2(alpha_n)} ] 5. Since tan(alpha_n) = frac{1}{cot(alpha_n)}, we get: [ tan(alpha_n) = frac{1}{sqrt{2n-1}} ] 6.

We start by expressing a general term {T}_{r+1} in the expansion as follows: {T}_{r+1} = {C}_{n}^{r}left(frac{sqrt{x}}{2}right)^{n-r}left(-frac{1}{sqrt[3]{x}}right)^{r} = {C}_{n}^{r}left(frac{1}{2}right)^{n-r}(-1)^{r}x^{frac{3n-5r}{6}}.

This gives us the quadratic equation n^2 - 5n - 50 = 0, which has solutions n=10 or n=-5. We discard n=-5 as n must be positive, thus n=10. There are 11 terms in the expansion, and the term with the largest binomial coefficient is the 6th term: {T}_{6} = {C}_{10}^{5}left(frac{1}{2}right)^{5}(-1)^{5}x^{frac{5}{6}} = -frac{63}{8}x^{frac{5}{6}}. Therefore, the term with the largest binomial coefficient in the expansion is the 6th term, {T}_{6} = -frac{63}{8}x^{frac{5}{6}}. **(2)** To find the term containing x^5, we continue with n=10: T_{r+1} = {C}_{10}^{r}left(frac{1}{2}right)^{10-r}(-1)^{r}x^{frac{30-5r}{6}}. Setting frac{30-5r}{6} = 5 and solving for r yields r=0. Therefore, the term is: T_{1} = {C}_{10}^{0}left(frac{1}{2}right)^{10}(-1)^{0}x^{5} = frac{1}{1024}x^{5}. The term containing x^5 in the expansion is the 1st term, T_{1} = frac{1}{1024}x^{5}. **Solution 2: Choose condition ②** **(1)** Given the sum of the binomial coefficients of the 2nd term and the 3rd term from the end is 55, we have: {C}_{n}^{1} + {C}_{n}^{n-2} = frac{n^2 + n}{2} = 55, which simplifies to n^2 + n - 110 = 0. Solving this equation yields n=10 or n=-11. We discard n=-11, thus n=10. The term with the largest binomial coefficient is the 6th term, which is the same as in Solution 1: {T}_{6} = -frac{63}{8}x^{frac{5}{6}}. Therefore, the term with the largest binomial coefficient in the expansion is the 6th term, {T}_{6} = -frac{63}{8}x^{frac{5}{6}}. **(2)** This is identical to Solution 1 (2), with the term containing x^5 being the 1st term, T_{1} = frac{1}{1024}x^{5}. **Solution 3: Choose condition ③** **(1)** Given {C}_{n+1}^{2} - {C}_{n}^{n-2} = 10, we can simplify this to {C}_{n+1}^{2} - {C}_{n}^{2} = 10 since {C}_{n}^{n-2} = {C}_{n}^{2}. This simplifies further to {C}_{n}^{1} = 10, implying n=10. Therefore, the term with the largest binomial coefficient is the 6th term, as before: {T}_{6} = -frac{63}{8}x^{frac{5}{6}}. Therefore, the term with the largest binomial coefficient in the expansion is the 6th term, {T}_{6} = -frac{63}{8}x^{frac{5}{6}}. **(2)** This is identical to Solution 1 (2) and Solution 2 (2), with the term containing x^5 being the 1st term, T_{1} = frac{1}{1024}x^{5}.

(1) Find a_1, a_2, and the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}; (2) Find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {na_n}.","completion":"(1) First, let's determine a_1 and a_2. For n=1, the given equation simplifies to: 2a_1 - a_1 = S_1 cdot S_1 Rightarrow a_1 = S_1^2. Since a_1 neq 0, we can conclude that S_1^2 neq 0. Therefore, we know S_1 = a_1 = 1 because it's the only square that equals itself non-zero. Now for n=2, we use the given relationship: 2a_2 - a_1 = S_1 cdot S_2 Rightarrow 2a_2 - 1 = 1 cdot (a_1 + a_2) Rightarrow 2a_2 - 1 = 1 + a_2 Rightarrow a_2 = 2. Next, we need to find the general formula for a_n. Since we know a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 2, we can rewrite the relation with S_{n-1} instead: 2a_n - 1 = 1 cdot S_n Rightarrow 2a_n - 1 = S_{n-1} + a_n Rightarrow a_n = 1 + S_{n-1}. To find S_{n-1}, we observe the pattern of a_n so far: a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2. It suggests a possible geometric progression. Therefore, we assume a_n = 2^{n-1}. To verify this assumption, we will use induction. Base case for n=2 holds true as a_2 = 2^{2-1} = 2. Assume it holds for n=k, then for n=k+1: a_{k+1} = 1 + S_k = 1 + (a_1 + a_2 + dots + a_k) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{k}2^{i-1} = 1 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1}2^i. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: 1 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1}2^i = 1 + (1-2^k)/(1-2) = 1 + 2^k - 1 = 2^{k} = 2^{(k+1)-1} = a_{k+1}. Hence, the assumption holds and thus a_n = boxed{2^{n-1}}. (2) Now to find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {na_n}: B_n = 1a_1 + 2a_2 + dots + na_n. Since we know a_n = 2^{n-1}, we have: B_n = 1 cdot 2^0 + 2 cdot 2^1 + dots + n cdot 2^{n-1} = sum_{k=1}^{n}k cdot 2^{k-1}. We now have to compute this sum. To do so, consider the sum 2B_n: 2B_n = 2 cdot 2^0 + 4 cdot 2^1 + dots + 2n cdot 2^{n-1}. Subtracting B_n from 2B_n: 2B_n - B_n = B_n = 2^0 + 2^1 + dots + n2^{n-1} - (2^0 + 2^1 + dots + (n-1)2^{n-2}). This leaves us with: B_n = n cdot 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} = (n + 1) cdot 2^{n-1}. But we must subtract the extra 2^{n-1} that was added to each term in the series: B_n = (n + 1)2^{n-1} - sum_{k=1}^{n}2^{k-1} = (n + 1)2^{n-1} - 2^n + 1 = n cdot 2^{n-1} + 1 - 2 cdot 2^{n-1} + 1 = (n - 1)2^{n-1} + 2.

Given that this segment is 5, we have: [ frac{105 - x}{2} = 5 ] 2. **Solve for ( x ) in Trapezoid A**: [ 105 - x = 10 implies x = 105 - 10 = 95 ] So, the shorter base of Trapezoid A is 95 units. 3. **Determine Details for Trapezoid B**: The longer base of Trapezoid B is ( 105 - 10 = 95 ) units. Using the relationship and the fact that the segment joining the diagonals' midpoints is usually half the difference of bases, we set the equation for Trapezoid B: [ frac{95 - y}{2} = 5 ] where ( y ) is the length of the shorter base of Trapezoid B. 4. **Solve for ( y )**: [ 95 - y = 10 implies y = 95 - 10 = 85 ] So, the shorter base of Trapezoid B is 85 units.

To prove that there exist two different sets ( A ) and ( B ) such that ( A(5) = B(5) ), we analyze the elements of ( A ) and ( B ). Step 2: Pairing Elements of ( A ) Note that each element of ( A ) except (-45) has its negative counterpart in ( B ). Let's denote these elements as pairs. For example: [ 1 leftrightarrow -1, quad 2 leftrightarrow -2, quad ldots ,quad 9 leftrightarrow -9 ] Step 3: Sums from ( A(5) ) Choose any 5 elements from ( A ) that include (-45).

The third case involves dividing the 4 boys into two groups of 3 and 1. The boy alone is inserted at the head or tail of the 4 gaps created by the arrangement of the 3 girls, and the group of 3 boys is inserted into one of the remaining 3 gaps. The problem can be solved using the principle of classification counting. This problem involves the application of permutations and combinations to a queuing problem.

Since 52% are even, the sequence starts and ends with an even number to have more even numbers than odd numbers. 2. **First Method:** Let the total number of even numbers be ( n ). Given that the sequence both starts and ends with an even number, the number of odd numbers must be ( n-1 ). Total numbers = ( n + (n-1) = 2n - 1 ). The percentage of even numbers is given by: [ frac{n}{2n-1} times 100% = 52% ] This leads to the equation: [ frac{n}{2n-1} times 100 = 52 ] Simplifying the equation: [ 100n = 52(2n - 1) ] [ 100n = 104n - 52 ] [ 104n - 100n = 52 ] [ 4n = 52 ] [ n = 13 ] 3. **Verification:** If ( n = 13 ): - Number of even numbers = 13 - Number of odd numbers = ( 13 - 1 = 12 ) - Total numbers = ( 13 + 12 = 25 ) Let's check the percentage: [ frac{13}{25} times 100% = 52% ] The percentage of even numbers is correct. 4. **Conclusion:** - There are ( 13 ) even numbers written on the board.

First, let's convert the speeds from km/hr to m/s to make the calculations easier: - Speed of the bus: 40 km/hr = (40 * 1000 m) / (3600 s) = 11.11 m/s - Speed of the skateboarder: 8 km/hr = (8 * 1000 m) / (3600 s) = 2.22 m/s Now, let's calculate the angular velocities (ω) of both the bus and the skateboarder. The angular velocity is given by the formula: ω = v / r where v is the linear velocity and r is the radius of the circular path. - Angular velocity of the bus (ω_bus): ω_bus = v_bus / r_bus = 11.11 m/s / 500 m = 0.02222 rad/s - Angular velocity of the skateboarder (ω_skateboarder): ω_skateboarder = v_skateboarder / r_skateboarder = 2.22 m/s / 250 m = 0.00888 rad/s Since they are moving in opposite directions, their relative angular velocity is the sum of their individual angular velocities: ω_relative = ω_bus + ω_skateboarder = 0.02222 rad/s + 0.00888 rad/s = 0.0311 rad/s The bus and the skateboarder start at opposite points on their respective circular paths, which means they are initially half a circle (π radians) apart.

The roots are: [2 - sqrt{5}, ;4+sqrt{10}, ;14 - 2sqrt{7}, ;-sqrt{2}.] **Step 1: Considering Radical Conjugates** Given that the polynomial has rational coefficients, the radical conjugate of each root must also be a root of the polynomial. This is because if a polynomial with rational coefficients has a root a + bsqrt{c}, where a, b, and c are rational numbers, and c is not a perfect square, then its conjugate a - bsqrt{c} must also be a root. This is a consequence of the polynomial having rational coefficients and the nature of complex conjugates. **Step 2: Calculating the Minimum Number of Roots** Since we have 4 given roots, and each of these roots must have a corresponding radical conjugate that is also a root, the polynomial must have at least 4 times 2 = 8 roots. This is because each of the original roots has one conjugate, doubling the total number of roots. **Step 3: Constructing a Polynomial for Each Pair of Conjugate Roots** To illustrate that a polynomial of degree 8 with rational coefficients that includes these roots is possible, we consider the construction of a monic quadratic polynomial for each pair of conjugate roots. For example, for the roots 2 - sqrt{5} and 2 + sqrt{5}, the monic quadratic polynomial that has these roots can be constructed as follows: [ (x - (2 - sqrt{5}))(x - (2 + sqrt{5})) = (x - 2 + sqrt{5})(x - 2 - sqrt{5}) = (x - 2)^2 - (sqrt{5})^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4 - 5 = x^2 - 4x - 1. ] This polynomial has rational coefficients, as expected. **Step 4: Conclusion** Since we have shown that for each pair of conjugate roots, a monic quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients exists, and since we need at least 8 roots to account for all the given roots and their conjugates, the smallest possible degree of the polynomial that satisfies the given conditions is boxed{8}.

Since 5% of the soft drink's calories were from added sugar, we calculate: 5% of 2500 calories = 0.05 * 2500 = 125 calories Mark exceeded the recommended intake of added sugar by 100%, which means he consumed twice the recommended amount. The recommended intake is 150 calories, so he consumed: 2 * 150 calories = 300 calories Now, we know that Mark got 125 calories of added sugar from the soft drink, so the remaining amount of added sugar he consumed came from the candy bars. To find out how many calories of added sugar were in the candy bars, we subtract the added sugar from the soft drink from the total added sugar consumed: 300 calories (total added sugar) - 125 calories (from soft drink) = 175 calories (from candy bars) Mark took 7 bars of candy, so to find the amount of added sugar in each bar, we divide the total added sugar from the candy bars by the number of bars: 175 calories / 7 bars = 25 calories of added sugar per bar Therefore, each bar of candy had boxed{25} calories of added sugar."},{"prompt":"What is the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of 2^{2010} times 5^{2012} times 7?","completion":"Calculate the mathematical expression: [ 2^{2010} times 5^{2012} times 7 = (2 times 5)^{2010} times 5^2 times 7 = 7 times 10^{2010} times 25.] [ = 7 times 25 times 10^{2010} = 175 times 10^{2010}.] The decimal representation of 175 times 10^{2010} is a 1 followed by two zeros (from the multiplication by 10^{2010}), and then the number 175.

Since there are more 2s than 5s in the factorization, we focus on counting the 5s to determine the number of 0s. First, we count the number of terms that contribute at least one factor of 5: - There are 96 terms from 5!, 10!, ldots, 100! that contribute at least one 5. - For every multiple of 10, starting from 10! to 100!, there are 91 terms contributing at least one additional 5. - For every multiple of 15, starting from 15! to 100!, there are 86 terms contributing at least one more 5. - This pattern continues down to 1 term for 95!. Summing these contributions, we have an arithmetic series with 20 terms, starting from 96 and ending with 1, decreasing by 5 each time. The sum of this series is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, S = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n), where n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the last term. Thus, we have: [S = frac{20}{2}(96 + 1) = 10 times 97 = 970] However, we have not yet accounted for higher powers of 5: - For n geq 25, each n! contributes an additional power of 5, adding 76 more 5s. - For n geq 50, each n! contributes yet another power of 5, adding 51 more 5s. - For n geq 75, each n! contributes yet another power of 5, adding 26 more 5s. - For n = 100, it contributes yet another power of 5, adding 1 more 5.

Combine inequalities: [ frac{2^k}{sqrt{2}} < n < frac{2^k}{sqrt{2}} + frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, ] implying: [ 2^k < n sqrt{2} < 2^k + 1, ] hence: [ lfloor n sqrt{2} rfloor = 2^k. ] 10. Thus, for ( n = leftlfloor frac{2^k}{sqrt{2}} rightrfloor + 1 ), ( lfloor sqrt{2} n rfloor = 2^k ), and continuing for infinitely many ( k ), we achieve the required result.

We need to determine the maximum number of sides of the quadrilateral ( mathrm{ANMK} ) that can each have a length of 1. 1. **Initial Assumption:** Suppose at least three sides of the quadrilateral ( mathrm{ANMK} ) are of length 1. There are two principal cases to consider based on the side lengths: - **Case 1:** (mathrm{AN} = mathrm{NM} = mathrm{MK} = 1) - Since (mathrm{N}) is a midpoint, (mathrm{NB} = 1), and since (mathrm{M}) is the centroid, ( mathrm{MB} = 2). - This creates a contradiction with the triangle inequality ((mathrm{MN} + mathrm{NB} = mathrm{MB})), so this case is not possible. - **Case 2:** (mathrm{KA} = mathrm{AN} = mathrm{NM} = 1) - Since (mathrm{K}) is a midpoint, (mathrm{AC} = 2), and since (mathrm{N}) is the midpoint, (mathrm{NC} = 3). - This also creates a contradiction with the triangle inequality ((mathrm{NA} + mathrm{AC} = mathrm{NC})), making this case impossible as well. 2. **Alternative Consideration:** If more than two sides of the quadrilateral are length 1, it implies either: - (mathrm{AK} = mathrm{NA}), - (text{or} mathrm{KM} = mathrm{MN}). In both scenarios above, triangle ( mathrm{ABC} ) would be isosceles: - **If ( mathrm{AK} = mathrm{NA}):** - This implies that ( mathrm{AKMN}) is a rhombus due to the equal sides, but this contradicts since ( mathrm{AK} ) and ( mathrm{NM} ) are not parallel. - **If ( mathrm{KM} = mathrm{MN}):** - This conclusion is similar to the rhombus scenario resulting in a contradiction as (mathrm{BK} = mathrm{CN} = 3). 3. **Third Scenario Analysis:** Consider point ( mathrm{L} ) which is the midpoint of side (mathrm{BC}): - If (mathrm{NM} = mathrm{NA} = mathrm{NB}), then (mathrm{triangle} mathrm{AMV}) is a right triangle. - Since triangle ( mathrm{LMK} ) is similar to ( mathrm{AMV} ) with a scaling factor of 0.5, (mathrm{MK}) is less than (mathrm{LK}), which is equal to (mathrm{NA}). - Hence, (mathrm{AM} > mathrm{LM}) making the hypotenuse of (mathrm{triangle} mathrm{AMK}) larger than (mathrm{LK}), which again implies (mathrm{AK}) is greater than (mathrm{LK} = mathrm{NA}).

Two players take turns marking points on a circle: the first player uses red, and the second player uses blue (marking the same point more than once is not allowed). The game ends when there are ( n ) points of each color marked. After that, each player finds the longest arc on the circle, with endpoints of their color, that contains no other marked points. The player who finds the longest such arc wins (if the lengths of the arcs are equal, or if such arcs do not exist for both players, the game is a draw). Which player can always win regardless of the opponent's strategy?","completion":"1. **Consider the Setup:** The game is played on a circle where two players alternately mark points. Player 1 (First) uses red, and Player 2 (Second) uses blue. 2. **Initial Assumption:** Assume that the length of the circle is n, where n is the number of points that each player will mark. Since the entire circle has 2n points (red and blue), this simplifies to dividing the circle into n sections. 3. **Strategy of the Second Player:** The Second Player employs a strategy to ensure that no dangerous arcs (arcs with red endpoints and no blue points in between) exceed length 1 in terms of these sections. The procedure is broken down into several steps: 4. **First Move and Subsequent Moves:** - Suppose the First Player marks a point of a regular n-gon inscribed in the circle. - The Second Player should then mark the next point of this n-gon. This means if the First Player marks point 1, the Second Player marks point 2 around the circle in sequence. 5. **Dealing With Dangerous Arcs:** - The arc between two adjacent marked vertices of the n-gon is considered an 'essential arc.' - If an essential arc has points only of one color, it is a 'clean arc.' If it has red endpoints, it is a 'dangerous arc.' 6. **Endgame Analysis:** - When all vertices of the n-gon are marked, suppose First has marked k vertices. Thus, Second has marked (n-k) vertices and has k moves remaining. - At most, there will be k-1 dangerous arcs, as there must be at least one clean essential arc between marks. 7. **Strategy Using Clean Arcs:** - The Second Player ensures clean arcs remain short by marking points strategically to split potential dangerous arcs. - Before the last move, all dangerous arcs have maximum length less than 1 in the context of these sections. 8. **Final Move of Second Player:** - At this step, any remaining clean arc will have a blue endpoint, ensuring the Second Player’s longest arc is not dangerous and securing points within safe bounds. 9. **Conclusion:** - The Second Player has a guaranteed win through this strategic marking. By ensuring that no dangerous arcs exceed a manageable length, they can always secure the longest safe arc. Therefore, the Second Player can always ensure a winning strategy regardless of the moves made by the First Player.

Therefore, [ 4 cdot [ABCD]^2 = 4 left( frac{sqrt{2}}{4} cdot AB cdot BC + frac{sqrt{2}}{4} cdot AD cdot DC right)^2. ] 8. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: [ 4 left( frac{sqrt{2}}{4} cdot AB cdot BC + frac{sqrt{2}}{4} cdot AD cdot DC right)^2 = 4 left( frac{sqrt{2}}{4} right)^2 cdot (AB cdot BC + AD cdot DC)^2. ] 9.

This implies that tan(alpha) = -2. 2. We know sin^2(alpha) = frac{tan^2(alpha)}{1+tan^2(alpha)} = frac{4}{1+4} = frac{4}{5}. Next, we rewrite the original expression using trigonometric identities, and substituting in sin(alpha) and cos(alpha): 1. sin(pi - alpha) = sin(alpha) because sin is a periodic function with period 2pi, and is also symmetric around pi. 2. sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - alpharight) = cos(alpha) by the co-function identity. 3. cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight) = -sin(alpha) by the sine of the supplementary angle identity. 4. cos(pi + alpha) = -cos(alpha) because cos is negative in the second quadrant.

Based on the previous factorization, consider: [ f(n^2) = max(f(n), f(n+1)). ] This indicates that between n and n^2, f(n) reaches a maximum value and is thus not strictly increasing for all values of n.

Hence, we have shown that there are indeed infinitely many n such that the largest prime divisor of n^4 + n^2 + 1 is the same as that of (n+1)^4 + (n+1)^2 + 1. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"There are several sets of three different numbers whose sum is 15 which can be chosen from { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 }.

We can ensure equal distances easily if, after clipping the two outermost clips, there is a middle clip in the remaining portion. Moreover, we require that this condition holds for each further division, with a middle clip being placed after each subsequent division. How many clips can we attach to the curtain rod if we want to fix the curtain in this manner?","completion":"To solve this problem, we should use the concept of recursively halving the intervals between clips. Let's examine the procedure in a step-by-step manner: 1. **Initial Setup:** Place the two clips at the ends of the curtain rod. This creates one interval. 2. **First Halving:** Place one clip at the midpoint of this interval. Now, we have two equal intervals. 3. **Second Halving:** Place a clip at the midpoint of each of the two intervals. This results in four equal intervals. 4. **Subsequent Halvings:** Continue in this manner. Each time, place a clip at the midpoint of every existing interval. After the kth step of halving, the number of intervals will be doubled compared to the previous step. To find the total number of clips after k steps, let's denote: - ( n_k ) as the number of intervals after the k-th halving - ( c_k ) as the total number of clips after k steps of halving Here are the detailed steps and calculations: 1. **Determine the Number of Intervals after ( k ) Steps:** - Initially, we have 1 interval (between the two end clips). - After the 1st step, this interval is split into 2 intervals. - After the 2nd step, each of the 2 intervals is split into 2 further intervals, resulting in a total of 4 intervals. - We can generalize this: After ( k )-th halving, the number of intervals becomes: [ n_k = 2^{k-1} ] 2. **Determine the Number of Clips:** - Initially, we have 2 clips (one at each end). - Each new clip added is used to split an interval into two. - The number of clips, ( c_k ), after k steps, is always one more than the number of intervals. This gives us: [ c_k = n_k + 1 = 2^{k-1} + 1 ] In conclusion, if we follow the described procedure of recursively halving the intervals, the number of clips required to attach the curtain to the rod after ( k ) steps of halving is: [ boxed{2^{k-1} + 1} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle XYZ, where XZ = 13 units and XY=12 units, and angle XYZ is a right angle at Y.

What is the minimum number of letters that can be placed in its cells so that no two identical letters are adjacent to each other?","completion":"We need to determine the minimum number of different letters that can be placed in a 100 times 100 grid such that no two identical letters are adjacent to each other, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 1. **Initial Consideration**: Let's start by relaxing the constraint to just horizontal and vertical adjacency. This means, we first consider a configuration where no two same letters are adjacent in those directions, ignoring diagonals. This is a simpler version of the larger problem. 2. **2-Color Checkerboard Pattern**: To avoid horizontal and vertical adjacency, we can place letters in a checkerboard pattern (also known as a 2-color pattern): \`\`\` A B A B A ... B A B A B ... A B A B A ... ... \`\`\` This type of pattern uses two different letters, 'A' and 'B', ensuring that no two adjacent cells horizontally or vertically have the same letter. 3. **Incorporating Diagonal Constraints**: Next, introduce the diagonal constraints. For the checkerboard pattern, adjacent cells diagonally are: A, B, A B, A, B A, B, A Here, diagonally adjacent cells have different letters in a 2-color checkerboard pattern. However, for larger squares, this may reintroduce conflicts. 4. **Expanding to a 2x2 Block Pattern**: We need a more complex pattern to avoid conflicts in all three directions. Consider a grid divided into 2 times 2 blocks: \`\`\` A B C D \`\`\` Repeating this as a tiling pattern throughout the 100 times 100 grid would look like: \`\`\` A B A B ... C D C D ... A B A B ... ... \`\`\` 5. **Checking the Pattern**: Within each 2 times 2 block, all adjacent letters are different: - Horizontally: 'A' is next to 'B', 'C' is next to 'D'. - Vertically: 'A' is next to 'C', 'B' is next to 'D'. - Diagonally: 'A' is next to 'D', 'B' is next to 'C'. Since no two identical letters are adjacent in any direction within and around these 2 times 2 blocks, the pattern works. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the smallest number of letters required to achieve this across the entire 100 times 100 table is four, corresponding to 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'.

We are told that any three delegates can communicate with each other either directly or indirectly using one of them as an interpreter. **Step 2:** Among any three delegates, there must be at least two who speak the same language. This is because if each delegate spoke a different language, they could not all communicate. **Step 3:** Select a group of three delegates from the 1000 delegates, and identify the pair who speak the same language. Place these two delegates in a single two-person hotel room. **Step 4:** After placing these two delegates, 998 delegates remain. Repeat the process: choose another set of three delegates from the remaining 998, find the two who speak the same language, and place them in a hotel room together. **Step 5:** Continue this process iteratively, reducing the number of delegates by two each time, until there are only four delegates left: (A, B, C), and (D). **Step 6:** Consider these four delegates: - Case 1: If every pair among ({A, B, C, D}) can communicate directly, there is no issue. Simply place any two together in each room. - Case 2: Suppose (A) and (B) cannot directly communicate.

Construct the reflection of the directrix ( D ) with respect to each of the tangents ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ). Let's denote these reflections as ( D'_{T_1} ) and ( D'_{T_2} ). 3. The focus ( F ) of the parabola is the point where the reflected directrices ( D'_{T_1} ) and ( D'_{T_2} ) intersect.

Therefore, we have: [a_{1} + a_{9} = a_{4} + a_{6}] Given also that a_{1} + a_{9} = a_{4}, we can substitute to find: [a_{4} + a_{6} = a_{4}] Subtracting a_{4} from both sides gives us: [a_{6} = 0] Thus, option A is correct, and we encapsulate this as boxed{A}. **For option B:** The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_{n} = frac{n}{2}(a_{1} + a_{n}). For S_{11}, we have: [S_{11} = frac{11}{2}(a_{1} + a_{11})] Since a_{11} = a_{1} + 10d (where d is the common difference), and we know a_{6} = 0, we can express a_{11} as 5d and a_{1} as -5d. Thus: [S_{11} = frac{11}{2}((-5d) + 5d) = 0] Therefore, option B is also correct, encapsulated as boxed{B}. **For option C:** The difference between S_{6} and S_{5} is the sixth term itself, a_{6}. Since we've established that a_{6} = 0, we have: [S_{6} - S_{5} = a_{6} = 0] This implies S_{5} = S_{6}, making option C correct, encapsulated as boxed{C}. **For option D:** Given a_{1} > 0 and the sequence is arithmetic, the first five terms are positive, and the sixth term is 0. The sum of the first n terms reaches its maximum when n=5 or n=6, as adding terms beyond a_{6}=0 would not increase the sum. Thus, S_{7} cannot be the largest since S_{5}=S_{6} represents the maximum sum achievable.

We also know that the line has an x-intercept at (4, 0). Since the line passes through P1 and the x-intercept, we can find the slope of the line using these two points. The slope (m) of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) Using the x-intercept (4, 0) and P1 (-6, y1), we have: m = (0 - y1) / (4 - (-6)) m = -y1 / 10 Now, we can use the slope and the point P2 to find the equation of the line. The point-slope form of the equation of a line is: y - y1 = m(x - x1) Using P2 (x2, 3) and the slope m, we have: 3 - y1 = (-y1 / 10)(x2 - (-6)) 3 - y1 = (-y1 / 10)(x2 + 6) Since the line passes through P2, we know that x2 is irrelevant to the y-coordinate of P1. We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 10 to get rid of the fraction: 10(3 - y1) = -y1(x2 + 6) Now, we can solve for y1: 30 - 10y1 = -y1(x2 + 6) Since we are looking for y1, we can ignore the x2 term as it will not affect the y-coordinate of P1. We can simplify the equation further: 30 - 10y1 = -y1 * 6 Now, we can solve for y1: 30 = -y1 * 6 + 10y1 30 = 4y1 y1 = 30 / 4 y1 = 7.5 Therefore, the y-coordinate of the first point (P1) is boxed{7.5} ."},{"prompt":"Two concentric circles have radii 3 and 5.

These tangents intersect the inner circle at points P and Q. Extend these tangents to intersect the outer circle again at points B' and C'. 3. **Using Right Triangle Properties**: Consider triangle OAP, a right triangle (since tangent at P is perpendicular to the radius OP). Here, OP = 3 (radius of the inner circle) and OA = 5 (radius of the outer circle). Using the Pythagorean theorem, AP^2 = OA^2 - OP^2 = 5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16, so AP = 4. 4. **Calculating angle AOP**: We have tan(angle AOP) = frac{OP}{AP} = frac{3}{4}. The angle angle AOP is therefore found using tan^{-1}(frac{3}{4}). This computes to approximately 36.87^circ. 5. **Arc Calculation**: The angle angle B'OC' subtended by arc B'C' is 2 times 36.87^circ = 73.74^circ.

Given that the parabola passes through the point (2,4), we substitute these values into the equation: [ 4^{2} = 2p cdot 2 implies 16 = 4p implies p = 4. ] Thus, the equation of C is y^{2} = 8x. - **Case 2**: Focus of C is on the y-axis. Let's assume the equation of the parabola C is x^{2} = 2py (p > 0). Given that the parabola passes through the point (2,4), we substitute these values into the equation: [ 2^{2} = 2p cdot 4 implies 4 = 8p implies p = frac{1}{2}. ] Thus, the equation of C is x^{2} = y.

From y_{1}y_{3} = y_{2}y_{4} = -16, we derive 8x + (frac{16}{y_{1}} + frac{16}{y_{2}})y + frac{256}{y_{1}y_{2}} = 0, which simplifies to y_{1}y_{2}x + 2(y_{1} + y_{2})y + 32 = 0. - Considering 2(y_{1} + y_{2}) - y_{1}y_{2} = 32, we find that left(x + yright)y_{1}y_{2} + 32left(y + 1right) = 0, leading to the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}x + y = 0, y + 1 = 0.end{array}right.

We need to determine if it's possible to color each of these numbers in either blue or red such that the sum of any two distinct numbers of the same color contains at least two '1's in its representation. 2. **Define Coloring Strategy:** - Color all numbers with an odd number of '1's in blue. - Color all numbers with an even number of '1's in red. 3. **Verify the Strategy:** - Consider two blue numbers. Each has an odd number of '1's. - When added, the sum will contain an even number of '1's plus 1 for each carry. Adding two odd numbers results in an even number. However, at least two '1's will be in their combined representation. This is due to a necessary carry during the addition. 4. **Analyze the Sum Calculation:** - Suppose (a) and (b) are two arbitrary numbers in binary form. Let (a = a_0a_1 ldots a_n) and (b = b_0b_1 ldots b_n). - Their sum (a + b) will have a binary form (s = s_0s_1 ldots s_n) where each (s_i = (a_i + b_i + c_i) mod 2) and (c_i) is the carry from the (i)th place. 5. **Extend the Shorter Sequence with Leading Zeros:** - To ensure that binary sequences (a) and (b) align correctly, prepend zeros to the shorter one until both sequences are of equal length. This standardizes the sum analysis. - Example: Consider (a = 1100) and (b = 0111). Extend (a) to (01100) to match the length of (b). 6. **Sum Representation Analysis:** - By adding two sequences, we analyze places where (a_i neq b_i). The presence of at least two carries will introduce two '1's. - If the sequences differ in at least two places, each difference generates a carry, sustaining the requirement for having at least two '1's. 7. **Check Different Colors:** - If the sequences vary at exactly one place, their total number of '1's would be off by one, and thus their resultant color assignment differs. 8. **Final Verification:** - Since sequences differing by at least two places guarantee two '1's, the divvied coloring scheme remains consistent. Summing same-colored numbers (both with either an odd or even number of '1's) will always result in at least two '1's in the final sum. 9. **Conclusion:** - It is feasible to color the required set's numbers such that the sum of any two like-colored numbers will always respect the problem's constraints.

This implies that f(0) = 0, and the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the origin. 2. **Three Zeros**: Given that f(x) has exactly 3 zeros and considering the symmetry due to the odd function property, we can deduce that one zero is at x=0, and the other two zeros are symmetrically placed about the origin, i.e., at x=a and x=-a for some a in mathbb{R}. 3. **Monotonically Increasing in (2, +infty)**: For f(x) to be monotonically increasing in this interval, the derivative f'(x) must be positive for x > 2. Considering these properties, a function that meets all these criteria is f(x) = x(x+1)(x-1). Let's verify this: - **Odd Function Check**: f(-x) = -x(-x+1)(-x-1) = -x(x-1)(x+1) = -f(x), confirming f(x) is an odd function. - **Zeros of f(x)**: Setting f(x) = 0 gives x(x+1)(x-1) = 0, which implies x = 0, -1, or 1. Thus, f(x) has exactly 3 zeros at x = 0, -1, and 1. - **Monotonicity Check**: The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = 3x^2 - 1. For x > 2, we have f'(x) = 3x^2 - 1 > 3(2)^2 - 1 = 11 > 0, which means f(x) is monotonically increasing in (2, +infty). Therefore, the function f(x) = x(x+1)(x-1) satisfies all the given conditions.

This means that every possible trio of friends has already been on duty within the first 99 days. Step 2. Analyze a Trio on Duty Consider any trio of friends on duty, say A, B, and C. Since everyone has only three friends in the group, they must have done duty together if we assume a fourth person D who could potentially create a new trio with each member. Consider A and D. Since D is not one of A's friends, the presence of D implies that initially, A, B, C, D must all be mutual friends. This means the only way A and D can be on duty together is in the combinations (A, B, D) and (A, C, D), but assuming (A, B, D), B must then have friends A, C, and D. Step 3. Deriving Contradiction If C and E are considered, where E is not a direct friend of any already mentioned members, the mixing of trios (A, B, C) does not continue with E due to E not being present in other members' friend list. This leads to a scenario where the duties do not intersect with the given logic, showing that mutual friendships must create closed groups within the main group. Step 4. Total Combinations of Friend Pairs Now, evaluating the count, each of the 100 people participating in duty must have done so only in specific framed ones by friend restrictions: - 99 text{ trios} times 3 text{ people} =297 - 100 text{ people} times 3 text{ duties each} =300 If there exists anyone with fewer than three duties, a logical breach arises that everyone else cannot fulfill fewer than exact counts leading to 296 max instead of 297.

After dropping the lowest score (D), Joe's average score across the remaining three tests improved to 40. This means that the total sum of the remaining three tests (A, B, and C) was 3 * 40 = 120. Since the total sum of the four tests was 140, and the sum of the three highest scores (A, B, and C) was 120, the lowest score (D) that was dropped can be calculated as follows: D = Sum of all four tests - Sum of the three highest tests D = 140 - 120 D = 20 Therefore, the lowest test score that Joe dropped was boxed{20} ."},{"prompt":"town X, 96 percent of the population are employed, and some percent of the population are employed males.

Let's denote each knight as a vertex in a graph where an edge represents a friendship and a lack of an edge represents enmity. 2. According to the problem, each knight has exactly three enemies. Hence, each vertex in the graph has a degree of ( n - 1 - 3 = n - 4 ) friends. Therefore, in a graph with ( n ) vertices, each vertex has exactly ( 3 ) edges missing. 3. Since each knight has exactly three enemies, and an enemy of an enemy is also an enemy, this ensures the consistency of the relationships. This means that the relationship is transitive in terms of enmity. 4. We start by considering the conditions given: - Each vertex (knight) must have exactly 3 edges (enemies). - The number of knights ( n ) must be such that the graph is valid under these conditions. 5. For ( n = 4 ): - Each knight can indeed have exactly 3 enemies, resulting in the knights forming a complete graph ( K_4 ) where every knight is connected to every other knight by an enmity relationship. This directly satisfies the given conditions. 6. For ( n = 5 ): - If there were 5 knights, each knight can have at most 4 enemies. This results in every knight being connected to every other knight by an enmity relationship (since they can't be connected as friends due to each having exactly ( 4 ) enemies). However, this exceeds the requirement of exactly 3 enemies per knight. Hence, ( n = 5 ) is not possible. 7. For ( n = 6 ): - Consider splitting the knights into two distinct groups of 3 knights each. - Each knight in the first group can have as enemies all the knights in the second group, which results in exactly 3 enemies per knight. - Similarly, each knight in the second group will have all knights in the first group as enemies.

In this scenario, overrightarrow{a} is technically parallel to overrightarrow{b} since the zero vector is parallel to any vector. Yet, there is no real number lambda that can satisfy overrightarrow{b}=lambdaoverrightarrow{0} unless overrightarrow{b} is also the zero vector. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it does not account for the special case involving the zero vector. **Option B:** The inequality |overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|leqslant ||overrightarrow{a}|-|overrightarrow{b}|| is proposed to always hold for any vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}. To counter this, consider vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} that are non-zero and have opposite directions.

Given that the difference between the numbers is equal to their product and that the sum of their squares is ( frac{45}{4} ), we have the following system of equations: [ x^2 + y^2 = frac{45}{4} ] [ x - y = xy ] 2. To solve this system, let us start by manipulating the first equation. Notice the identity for the sum of squares: [ x^2 + y^2 = (x-y)^2 + 2xy ] 3. Substitute ( x - y = xy ) into the identity: [ x^2 + y^2 = (xy)^2 + 2xy ] 4. Given that ( x^2 + y^2 = frac{45}{4} ), equating both expressions, we get: [ (xy)^2 + 2xy = frac{45}{4} ] 5. Let ( xy = k ). Substitute ( k ) for ( xy ): [ k^2 + 2k = frac{45}{4} ] 6. Rearrange this equation into a standard quadratic form: [ 4k^2 + 8k = 45 ] [ 4k^2 + 8k - 45 = 0 ] 7.

This gives us two possible values for ( k ): [ k = frac{20}{8} = frac{5}{2} ] [ k = frac{-36}{8} = -frac{9}{2} ] 9. Since one value ( k = frac{5}{2} ) does not suit the sign condition from ( x ) and ( y ) (as they can't both be positive or negative due to the given conditions and their product), we take ( k = -frac{9}{2} ). Hence: [ xy = -frac{9}{2} ] [ x - y = -frac{9}{2} ] 10. Next, utilize these results in the derived relationships. By squaring both sides of the equation ( x + y ): [ (x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy ] [ (x+y)^2 = frac{45}{4} - 9 = frac{9}{4} ] [ x + y = pm frac{3}{2} ] 11.

This needs to be rewritten and checked as a perfect square: Delta = 24(54 - k^2).

As 24 factors into 2^3 cdot 3, n^2 must account for the missing 2 and 3, implying n might be of 6m form to make 24n^2 = 864m^2 a perfect square (n = 6m gives 864m^2).

Since the line passes through point P(1, 4), we have 4 = m cdot 1 + b. The x-intercept occurs when y = 0, which gives us the point (frac{-b}{m}, 0). Since the intercepts must be positive, both b and frac{-b}{m} must be positive, which in turn implies that m is negative. The sum of the intercepts is the x-intercept plus the y-intercept, which is S = frac{-b}{m} + b. To minimize this sum, we can take the derivative concerning m and equate it to zero to find the optimal value of m. However, as there is a simpler way to determine m and b under the conditions provided, let us use the fact that intercepts are inversely proportional to the direction ratios of the line. For a line with direction ratios proportional to a and b, the x-intercept is proportional to frac{1}{a}, and the y-intercept is proportional to frac{1}{b}. Thus, for our line frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} = frac{a+b}{ab} is minimized when a = b since the product ab is constant for a fixed a+b. This suggests that for the sum of the intercepts to be minimal, the absolute values of the slope m and y-intercept b should be equal, resulting in a line at a 45-degree angle to the axes. With m = -1, the condition 4 = (-1) cdot 1 + b gives us b = 5. Therefore, our line's equation in slope-intercept form is y = -x + 5. Alternatively, to find the same result using a different approach, knowing that m = -1, the x-intercept is the positive value b, and we aim to minimize b + frac{b}{-1} = b - b = 0. However, since b must be positive, its minimum is the smallest positive real value, which is confirmed by the point P(1, 4) implying b = 5. Given that we use the standard form Ax + By = C for line equations, with A, B, C being integers, we can rewrite our equation as x + y = 5. Adjusting to have all terms on one side gives x + y - 5 = 0.

Since the cube has exactly 12 edges, if we use 7 colors, then at least one color (say, white) must be used only once. - The edge colored white will be adjacent to exactly 4 other edges.

The solution can be concluded by considering the number of choices for each part of the password: 1. **Year**: - The first 2 digits represent the last 2 digits of someone's birth year. - Assuming the range of years is from 1900 to 1999, these last 2 digits can range from 00 to 99. - Thus, there are (100) possible values for the year. 2. **Month**: - The middle 2 digits represent the month of birth. - There are 12 months in a year. - Thus, there are (12) possible values for the month. 3. **Day**: - The last 2 digits represent the day of birth. - The days in a month can range from 01 to 31. - Thus, there are (31) possible values for the day. By multiplying these together, we get the total number of possible passwords: [ 100 times 12 times 31 = 37,200 ] # Conclusion: The total number of possible passwords is ( boxed{37,200} )."},{"prompt":"what is the tens digit of 6 ^ 18 ?","completion":"To find the tens digit of 6^18, we can look at the pattern of the tens digit as we raise 6 to increasing powers. 6^1 = 6 (tens digit is 0) 6^2 = 36 (tens digit is 3) 6^3 = 216 (tens digit is 1) 6^4 = 1296 (tens digit is 9) 6^5 = 7776 (tens digit is 7) 6^6 = 46656 (tens digit is 6) 6^7 = 279936 (tens digit is 3) 6^8 = 1679616 (tens digit is 1) 6^9 = 10077696 (tens digit is 9) 6^10 = 60466176 (tens digit is 7) We can see that the tens digit follows a repeating pattern: 0, 3, 1, 9, 7, 6, 3, 1, 9, 7, ...

According to the problem, John spent: - 1/2 of his money on fresh fruits and vegetables, so that's (1/2) * X. - 1/3 of his money on meat products, so that's (1/3) * X. - 1/10 of his money on bakery products, so that's (1/10) * X. - The remaining 8 on candy. The sum of these expenditures should equal the total amount of money John had: (1/2) * X + (1/3) * X + (1/10) * X + 8 = X To solve for X, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 30 (the least common multiple of 2, 3, and 10). We can then rewrite the equation as: (15/30) * X + (10/30) * X + (3/30) * X + 8 = X Combining the fractions, we get: (15/30 + 10/30 + 3/30) * X + 8 = X (28/30) * X + 8 = X Now, we subtract (28/30) * X from both sides of the equation to isolate the 8 on one side: 8 = X - (28/30) * X To combine the terms on the right side, we can express X as (30/30) * X: 8 = (30/30) * X - (28/30) * X 8 = (2/30) * X Now, we solve for X by dividing both sides by (2/30): X = 8 / (2/30) Inverting the fraction (2/30) when dividing, we get: X = 8 * (30/2) X = 8 * 15 X = 120 So, John had boxed{120} initially and that's the total amount he spent at the supermarket."},{"prompt":"Given that the graph of the quadratic function y=x^{2}2bx+b^{2}+b5(b is a constant) intersects the xaxis, and when x lt 3.5, y decreases as x increases, then the range of values for b is ( ) A: bleqslant 5 B: bgeqslant 5 C: 3.5leqslant bleqslant 5 D: 3.5leqslant b lt 5","completion":"To solve for the range of values for b, we analyze the given quadratic function y=x^{2}-2bx+b^{2}+b-5 in two parts: the condition for it to intersect the x-axis and the behavior of the function when x < 3.5. **Step 1: Intersection with the x-axis** For a quadratic function to intersect the x-axis, its discriminant Delta must be greater than or equal to 0.

When the moving train is crossing the stationary train, it has to cover the length of the stationary train plus its own length. Let's denote the length of the moving train as L. The total distance covered by the moving train when crossing the stationary train is L (its own length) + 600 meters (the length of the stationary train).

Since the sum is due 3 years hence, t = 3 years. We also know that the Banker's Discount (BD) is the simple interest on the face value (FV) of the debt for the same period. The formula for Banker's Discount is: BD = (FV * r * t) / 100 Since the True Discount (TD) is the present value of the debt, we can say that the present value (P) plus the True Discount (TD) is equal to the face value (FV) of the debt: P + TD = FV We already know TD = Rs. 1000, and we can calculate P using the Banker's Discount (BD) and the Banker's Gain (BG): P = BD - BG P = Rs. 1360 - Rs. 360 P = Rs. 1000 Now we have P = Rs. 1000 and FV = P + TD = Rs. 1000 + Rs. 1000 = Rs. 2000. Using the formula for True Discount and substituting the known values, we get: TD = (P * r * t) / 100 1000 = (1000 * r * 3) / 100 1000 = (3000 * r) / 100 1000 = 30 * r r = 1000 / 30 r = 100 / 3 r = 33.33% Therefore, the percentage per annum is boxed{33.33%} ."},{"prompt":"Rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework, 2 pages of reading homework and 96 more pages of biology homework..

Since f(x) - f(frac{1}{x-3}) = f(x) - [f(1) - f(x-3)] = f(x) + f(x-3) = f(x^2 - 3x), Given f(2) = 1, we have 2 = 2 times 1 = 2f(2) = f(2) + f(2) = f(4). Therefore, f(x) - f(frac{1}{x-3}) leqslant 2 is equivalent to f(x^2 - 3x) leqslant f(4)quadquad(1), And x > 0, x - 3 > 0 (since the domain of f(x) is (0,+infty)), Since x(x - 3) = x^2 - 3x > 0, 4 > 0, And f(x) is increasing on (0,+infty), Therefore, (1) iff x^2 - 3x leqslant 4 iff -1 leqslant x leqslant 4, and x > 3, Hence, the solution set of the original inequality is boxed{{x mid 3 < x leqslant 4}}."},{"prompt":"y is generating a sequence of positive integers by adjusting the rules Terri used.

Now, let's derive solutions that match the criteria without transferring honey between barrels. First Solution: - The first and second person each take: - Three full barrels (3 units of honey), - One half-full barrel (0.5 units of honey), - Three empty barrels.

Thus, the third person gets: - Total honey = (1 + 2.5 = 3.5) units. - Total barrels = (1 + 5 + 1 = 7) barrels. Second Solution: - The first and second person each take: - Two full barrels (2 units of honey), - Three half-full barrels (1.5 units of honey), - Two empty barrels. Thus, for each of the first and second person, they get: - Total honey = (2 times 1 + 3 times 0.5 = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5) units. - Total barrels = (2 + 3 + 2 = 7) barrels. - The third person takes: - Three full barrels (3 units of honey), - One half-full barrel (0.5 units of honey), - Three empty barrels.

The sum of these angles will be: [ x + (x+d) + (x+2d) + ... + (x+7d) = 8x + 28d. ] Setting this equal to 1080 gives: [ 8x + 28d = 1080. ] We simplify by dividing the equation by 4: [ 2x + 7d = 270. ] Since x and d must be integers, we consider how they interact under the constraint x + 7d < 170, as the largest angle needs to be less than 170 degrees. Additionally, since the hexagon is not equiangular, d > 0.

Therefore, ( f(x) ) does not have any critical points in the real number domain. Since the coefficient of ( x^3 ) in ( f(x) ) is positive, ( f(x) rightarrow infty ) as ( x rightarrow pminfty ).

Nonetheless, it seems the lowest value ( f(x) ) reaches given no true critical points, and ( f(x) rightarrow infty ) as ( x rightarrow pminfty ). Conclusion: Since ( f(x) ) has no minimum in its domain, it only reaches as low as ( f(1) = 2021 ) around which it transitions in concavity.

Formally, let these powers be (2^a) and (2^b) where (a neq b), and both have the same digits in different orders. 2. **Divisibility Considerations (Modulo 9)**: Both (2^a) and (2^b) are not divisible by 3 (since any power of 2 greater than 1 is not divisible by 3). Given that they are rearrangements of the same digits, the sum of their digits will also be the same. This means: [ 2^a equiv 2^b pmod{9} ] 3. **Multiplicative Constraints**: Let (2^a) be the smaller power and (2^b) be the larger power. To maintain the same number of digits under decimal representation, multiplying (2^a) by 2, 4, or 8 is required to get the larger power: [ 2^b = 2^a cdot k quad text{where } k in {2, 4, 8} ] 4. **Alteration in Modulo 9**: If ((2^a cdot k) equiv 2^a pmod{9}), using properties of modular arithmetic, we observe: [ 2^a(2, 4, text{ or } 8) equiv 2^a pmod{9} ] Consequently: [ 2^a cdot 2 equiv 2^a pmod{9} quad text{or} quad 2^a cdot 4 equiv 2^a pmod{9} quad text{or} quad 2^a cdot 8 equiv 2^a pmod{9} ] For any (k in {2, 4, 8}), this results in a contradiction since multiplying by (2), (4), or (8) would change the residue modulo 9, showing the impossibility of maintaining the same residue. 5. **Periodic Sequence Verification**: The residues of successive powers of 2 modulo 9 form a periodic sequence. Listing a few: [ 2^1 equiv 2 pmod{9}, quad 2^2 equiv 4 pmod{9}, quad 2^3 equiv 8 pmod{9}, quad 2^4 equiv 7 pmod{9}, quad 2^5 equiv 5 pmod{9}, quad 2^6 equiv 1 pmod{9}, quad ldots ] This sequence repeats every 6 terms. 6. **Mathematical Conclusion**: Given the periodic sequence where (2^{n+6} equiv 2^n pmod{9}), and considering: [ 2^{n+k} notequiv 2^n cdot k pmod{9} quad text{for any } k in {2, 4, 8} ] it contradicts the possibility of rearranging the digits of a power of 2 to get another power of 2. # Conclusion: Thus, no such power of 2 exists where rearranging its digits forms another power of 2, keeping all digits non-zero.

This implies some part of ( triangle ACD ) must lie outside of ( triangle ABC ), breaking the boundary set by ( AC ). 6. **Bounding nature of equilateral triangles:** - Such a configuration leads to ( triangle ACD ) overlapping or intersecting with another triangle if adjacency occurs along any of the boundary lines. - If another triangle were adjacent to ( triangle ABC ) along ( BC ), this same logic of extension and necessary intersection holds. 7. **Contradiction due to overlap:** - Given the convexity of the polygon, any triangle sharing a side with ( triangle ABC ) must share boundary conditions of overlap. This would result in intersections, which is impossible for non-intersecting equilateral triangles. - The vertices where ( AB ) and the combined opposite sides should meet, are beyond 180 degrees, which contradicts the nature of equilateral triangles confined within a convex shape. 8. **Convex requirement and vertex angles:** - The angle criterion of equilateral triangles doesn't allow for boundary angles of greater than 180 degrees, verifying the lack of triangle accommodation inside a convex polygon without intersection or excess extension. # Conclusion: Thus, it is impossible to divide a convex polygon into 100 different equilateral triangles without violating the fundamental properties and boundaries of triangular and polygonal geometries.

The set C is a collection of ordered pairs (x, y), where the y-value corresponds to x^2+1. This is the set of points on the graph of the parabola y=x^2+1.

The number of divisors of ( n ) is given by: [ d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1) ] The product of all divisors of ( n ) is ( n^{d(n)/2} ).

Prove that starting in an arbitrary town one can make a round trip along the highways such that each town is passed exactly once and finally one returns to its starting point.","completion":"To prove that starting in an arbitrary town one can make a round trip along the highways such that each town is passed exactly once and finally one returns to its starting point, we need to show that the graph formed by the towns and highways is Hamiltonian. 1. **Graph Representation and Degree Condition**: - Let ( G ) be a graph where each vertex represents a town and each edge represents a highway. - Given that there are 2009 towns and each town is connected to exactly 1004 other towns, ( G ) is a 1004-regular graph with 2009 vertices. 2. **Hamiltonian Cycle in Regular Graphs**: - A well-known result in graph theory is Dirac's theorem, which states that a graph with ( n ) vertices (where ( n geq 3 )) is Hamiltonian if every vertex has a degree of at least ( frac{n}{2} ). - In our case, ( n = 2009 ) and each vertex has a degree of 1004. Since ( 1004 geq frac{2009}{2} ), Dirac's theorem implies that ( G ) contains a Hamiltonian cycle. 3. **Constructing the Hamiltonian Cycle**: - Let the largest cycle in the graph be ( C_1 ). With the remaining vertices, take the largest cycle to be ( C_2 ). Continue like this defining ( C_3, C_4, ldots, C_k ). - Let ( s = |C_k| ). It is clear that ( |C_1| geq |C_2| geq cdots geq |C_k| ). Additionally, if ( 2009 > |C_1| ), it follows that ( 1004 geq s ). Thus, every vertex of ( C_k ) is connected to another vertex outside of ( C_k ). 4. **Connecting Cycles**: - For every vertex ( v in C_k ), ( v ) is connected to at most ( frac{1}{2}|C_i| ) vertices of ( C_i ) for ( i < k ), since otherwise ( v ) would be connected to two adjacent vertices and thus the maximality of ( C_i ) would be compromised. - Consider the spacing (number of vertices) between vertices connected to ( v ) in a cycle ( C_i ) for ( i ne k ). We shall show that the spacing is strictly less than ( s + 1 ). 5. **Spacing Argument**: - Suppose otherwise. Then, in some cycle, ( C_i ), ( v ) is connected to at most ( frac{1}{2}(|C_i| - s) ). Otherwise, the maximum number of connected vertices in ( C_j ) (( j ne i, k )) is ( frac{1}{2}|C_j| ). - It follows that the number of vertices outside of ( C_k ) connected to ( v ) is at most: [ -frac{1}{2}s + frac{1}{2}left(C_1 + C_2 + cdots + C_{k-1}right) = -frac{1}{2}s + frac{1}{2}(2009 - s) = 1004.5 - s ] - Since ( v ) can be connected to at most ( s - 1 ) vertices of ( C_k ), it follows that ( deg(v) leq 1003.5 ), a contradiction. 6. **Combining Cycles**: - Now we consider two consecutive vertices ( v_1, v_2 in C_k ). Consider the vertices in ( C_1 ) to which they are connected. Let ( a in C_1 ) to which ( v_1 ) is connected. - If ( v_2 ) is connected to some vertex within a spacing of ( s - 1 ) of ( a ), then we may join the two cycles ( C_1 ) and ( C_k ) to create a cycle larger than ( C_1 ). - Otherwise, the closest vertices ( b, c in C_1 ) on either side of ( a ) (in the cycle ( C_1 )) connected to ( v_2 ) are a spacing of ( s ) away from ( a ). But then the spacing between the vertices ( b, c ) is at least ( s + 1 ) (as long as ( |C_1| > s ); the case ( |C_1| = s ) is trivial) which is a contradiction to the fact that all spacings of vertices in ( C_1 ) connected to ( v_2 ) are at most ( s ). Thus, we have shown that the graph ( G ) is Hamiltonian, and therefore, starting in an arbitrary town, one can make a round trip along the highways such that each town is passed exactly once and finally one returns to its starting point.

Prove that the large cube has at least one monochromatic face.","completion":"1. Let's assume that Misha has 1000 identical cubes, and each cube has: - One pair of opposite faces painted white, - One pair of opposite faces painted blue, - One pair of opposite faces painted red. 2. Misha arranges these cubes into a larger cube of dimensions ( 10 times 10 times 10 ), where the small cubes are aligned such that faces of the same color are adjacent to each other. 3. To prove that there is a single-colored face on the large cube, let's start by considering the arrangement of the small cubes row by row and layer by layer. 4. Focus on one particular row of (10) cubes in the larger cube. Each small cube in this row is aligned such that its colored faces are consistent with its neighbors. 5. Each small cube in the row has its pair of opposite blue faces, white faces, and red faces aligned. To ensure consistency in the arrangement: - The top and bottom layer will have the same color alignment across all small cubes. - This consistency ensures that the color scheme repeats uniformly across the layers. 6. Now, let’s consider the top face of the (10 times 10 times 10) large cube: - The top face is composed of (10 times 10) small cube faces. 7. Given the arrangement constraints: - Neighboring small cubes must have their touching faces of the same color (either blue, white, or red). 8. Since each dimension features a consistent color pairing: - The entire set of (10 times 10) small cubes on the top layer should theoretically have the same color on their topmost faces. 9. This color uniformity extends from the bottom-most layer to the top-most layer due to the pairing constraints between small cubes. 10. By considering the vertical alignment: - All small cube faces that form a larger face of the large cube must collectively display the same color to maintain the pairwise consistency. # Conclusion: Therefore, due to the consistent alignment of the color-paired faces of the small cubes that form the large cube, there necessarily exists at least one large face of the (10 times 10 times 10) cube that is completely of one color.

We have [ (a + b + c^2) left(frac{9}{a} + frac{16}{b} + frac{25}{c^2}right) geq 144. ] To minimize ( frac{9}{a} + frac{16}{b} + frac{25}{c^2} ), we need ( frac{9}{a} + frac{16}{b} + frac{25}{c^2} geq frac{144}{a + b + c^2} ). Since ( a + b + c = 5 ) and ( c^2 ) will be a positive real number typically greater than ( c ), this inequality's lower bound will differ, depending on ( c )'s value. Equality occurs when ( frac{9}{a} = 3 ), ( frac{16}{b} = 4 ), and ( frac{25}{c^2} = 5 ), which gives us ( a = 3, b = 4, ) and ( c^2 = 5 ) (or ( c = sqrt{5} )). Checking the sum ( a + b + c = 3 + 4 + sqrt{5} ), which does not equal 5. Thus, we must find a valid ( c ) such that ( a + b + c = 5 ) and maintains inequality: Assuming ( c^2 = c ) (i.e., ( c = 1 )), then ( a + b + 1 = 5 ) leads to ( a + b = 4 ).

According to the problem: [ S_b = frac{1}{2} S_l ] The relationship between the area of the base and the lateral face would be crucial for identifying the relations of the spheres. 3. **Height and Inscribed Sphere Radius:** Given the height (h = 70 text{ cm}), the radius of the inscribed sphere ((r_1)) can be found using properties of pyramids. However, for simplicity, the detailed geometric properties need not be delved into deeply because successive spheres will follow a geometric sequence in radius. 4. **Volume of a Sphere:** Recall, the volume (V) of a sphere with radius (r) is: [ V = frac{4}{3} pi r^3 ] 5. **Relationship Between Radii of Successive Spheres:** Each sphere (S_{n+1}) is tangential to both a lateral face and the preceding sphere (S_n).

To find the maximum distance d from point P(-2,1) to line l, we consider the distance between P and A: [ d = sqrt{(-2-1)^2 + (1+1)^2} = sqrt{9 + 4} = sqrt{13} ] Thus, the maximum distance d is boxed{sqrt{13}}. The slope of line PA is calculated as follows: [ k_{PA} = frac{1 - (-1)}{-2 - 1} = frac{2}{-3} = -frac{2}{3} ] Since the slope of line l is perpendicular to PA, we have k_l = -frac{1}{k_{PA}} = frac{3}{2}. Given that the slope of line l is frac{3}{2}, and it passes through point A(1, -1), we can find the value of a by setting the slope equal to -frac{1}{a}, which gives a = -frac{2}{3}. Therefore, the equation of line l at this time is: [ x - frac{2}{3}y - frac{5}{3} = 0 implies 3x - 2y - 5 = 0 ] So, the equation of line l is boxed{3x - 2y - 5 = 0}.

The distance d from the center of the circle (0,0) to the line is given by the formula d=frac{|0+0+m|}{sqrt{1^2+1^2}}=frac{|m|}{sqrt{2}}.

Since the incircle is tangent to sides (BC), (AC), and (AB) at (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1) respectively, we have the following equalities based on tangent segments from a point to a circle: [ BA_1 = CA_1, quad AB_1 = CB_1, quad AC_1 = BC_1. ] 3.

Thus, the equation of the ellipse is frac{x^{2}}{4} + y^{2} = 1. (II) Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). Since the perpendicular bisector of AB passes through point (0, frac{1}{2}), the slope k of AB exists. When the slope of line AB is k = 0, x_1 = -x_2 and y_1 = y_2. Therefore, the area of triangle AOB is S_{triangle AOB} = frac{1}{2} cdot 2|x| cdot |y| = |x| cdot sqrt{1 - frac{x_1^2}{4}}.

The coordinates of the midpoint of AB can be calculated, and using the perpendicular relationship between lines, we obtain 1 + 4k^2 = -6m ②. From ①②, we have -6m > m^2, which gives -6 < m < 0. The distance d from O(0, 0) to the line y = kx + m is d = frac{|m|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}}, and |AB| = sqrt{1 + k^2}|x_1 - x_2| = sqrt{1 + k^2} cdot 4 cdot sqrt{frac{1 + 4k^2 - m^2}{(1 + 4k^2)^2}}.

Let's break down the solution in a detailed manner. 1. **Understanding the Scenario:** We have a random experiment with the probability of event ( A ) occurring given by ( p = P(A) = varepsilon > 0 ), where ( varepsilon ) (epsilon) is a very small positive number. 2. **Calculation of Aggregate Probability:** Consider a sequence of 300 independent trials of this random experiment. Let (lambda) be the average number of occurrences of event ( A ) in these 300 trials. Given ( p = varepsilon ), for 300 trials: [ lambda = 300 times varepsilon ] Here, we are given ( varepsilon = 0.01 ), so: [ lambda = 300 times 0.01 = 3 ] 3. **Using Poisson Distribution:** The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of occurrences of an event within a fixed interval of time or space. In this case, it’s suitable because the probability ( p ) is small, and the number of trials ( n ) is large. Probability mass function of Poisson distribution is: [ P(xi = k) = frac{lambda^k mathrm{e}^{-lambda}}{k!} ] 4. **Calculating Probability ( P(0 leqslant xi leqslant 4) ):** We need to find the probability that the number of occurrences (xi) is between 0 and 4.

This high probability demonstrates that even though ( varepsilon ) is very small, the cumulative effect over many trials makes the event almost certain to occur.

Probability of drawing a black ball again: [ P(B) = P(A text{ and } B) + P(bar{A} text{ and } B) ] 2. **Calculating ( P(B) ):** - For the case when the first draw results in a black ball ( A ): [ P(A) cdot P(B mid A) = frac{a}{a+b} cdot frac{a}{a+b} ] - For the case when the first draw results in a white ball ( bar{A} ): [ P(bar{A}) cdot P(B mid bar{A}) = frac{b}{a+b} cdot frac{a}{a+b} ] Summing these, we get: [ P(B) = frac{a}{a+b} cdot frac{a}{a+b} + frac{b}{a+b} cdot frac{a}{a+b} = frac{a}{a+b} left( frac{a+b}{a+b} right) = frac{a}{a+b} ] Therefore, the probability of drawing a black ball in the second draw is the same as the first draw, showing independence.

We need to determine whether the number of positive numbers is greater than the number of negative numbers after increasing each real root by 1. 2. **Analyzing the Roots:** Since the coefficients of the polynomial are all positive, by Descartes' Rule of Signs, the polynomial has no positive real roots. Therefore, all real roots of the polynomial are negative. 3. **Pairing Polynomials:** Consider a polynomial (P(x)) with coefficients (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{45}). We can construct another polynomial (Q(x)) with coefficients in reverse order, i.e., (a_{45}, a_{44}, ldots, a_0). The relationship between (P(x)) and (Q(x)) is given by: [ P(x) = Qleft(frac{1}{x}right) cdot x^{45} ] This implies that if (r) is a root of (P(x)), then (frac{1}{r}) is a root of (Q(x)). 4. **Root Analysis:** For any root (r) of (P(x)) with (|r| > 1), there exists a corresponding root (s = frac{1}{r}) of (Q(x)) with (|s| < 1). This pairing ensures that for every root (r) with (|r| > 1), there is a root (s) with (|s| < 1), and vice versa. 5. **Increasing Roots by 1:** When we increase each root by 1, we need to consider the new values: - If (r < -1), then (r + 1 < 0). - If (-1 < r < 0), then (r + 1 > 0). 6. **Counting Positive and Negative Numbers:** Since the polynomial is of degree 45, it has 45 roots.

Observations from the statements provided in the problem show a pattern of alternating claims about the majority being boys or girls: - Initially, a child states \\"Most of us are boys.\\" - The next child states \\"Most of us are girls.\\" - This alternation continues around the table, returning to the first child who repeats \\"Most of us are boys.\\" 3. Key observations about the pattern of statements: - The majority statement changes every time because statements like \\"Most of us are boys\\" and \\"Most of us are girls\\" alternate consistently. - Such alternation implicates that these statements must cross the boundary between groups of boys and girls. 4. Since there are 13 children, and the statements alternate, it implies an even split in the falsehood and truth-telling groups: - The total number of statements is 13. - Since each type of statement alternates in truth value, there are 7 statements in one majority group and 6 in the other. 5. To conclude the pattern of these statements, we see that: - If there were an even number of boys and girls, the alternation would not be possible to satisfy the given condition. - Given that the statements reflect groups of children, we infer that the groups involved alternate between boys and girls with a somewhat equal distribution but skewed to maintain a majority group. 6.

Step-by-Step Calculation: 1. From equation 1: [ 15alpha = 360k implies alpha = frac{360k}{15} = 24k ] Thus, alpha must be a multiple of 24 degrees. 2.

Thus, position = 1 (group one) + 7 (all lights in first group) + 2 (for second red light in the second group) = 10. - The 30th red light requires calculation of full groups and additional lights: - Every two sequences (14 lights), there are 6 red lights. So, 5 groups (5 * 14 = 70 lights) have 30 red lights. The 28th, 29th, and 30th red are at lights 70, 71, and 72 respectively in position within their whole sequence count. 3. **Calculate Number of Lights Between 5th and 30th Red Lights**: - Lights between them are from position 10 to 72. Total = 72 - 10 = 62 lights. 4. **Calculate Number of Gaps and Convert to Distance**: - With 62 lights, there are 62 gaps at 8 inches each. - Total inches = 62 * 8 = 496 inches. 5. **Convert Distance to Feet**: - Total feet = 496 / 12 = 41.3333 feet. Rounded down to the nearest inch as we tend to measure in feet and inches, we have 41 feet. Conclusion: The total distance between the 5th red light and the 30th red light is 41 feet.

Here is the full detail of how we arrive at the answer. 1. **Understanding the Problem**: - There are 500 cyclists in a race. - The race consists of 15 stages. - Cyclists' positions are determined by their total time across all stages. - No cyclists have identical times, either on individual stages or in total. - Vasya finishes 7th in every stage. 2. **Key Observation**: - If a cyclist ( A ) has a better (lower-numbered) rank than cyclist ( B ), it means ( A ) must have finished ahead of ( B ) in at least one stage. 3. **Implication for Vasya**: - Vasya, finishing 7th in all 15 stages, is therefore overtaken by 6 cyclists in each stage. - Hence, across all 15 stages, a total of ( 6 times 15 = 90 ) different cyclists must have finished ahead of Vasya. 4. **Maximum Possible Rank for Vasya**: - Since Vasya is overtaken by 90 different cyclists, the highest rank Vasya can attain is when these 90 cyclists all finish ahead of him. This implies that there could be at most 90 cyclists with a better (lower-numbered) total time than Vasya. - Therefore, Vasya can potentially finish right after these 90 cyclists, giving him the rank: [ 1 + 90 = 91 ] Hence, Vasya’s worst possible rank (highest number) is 91, meaning there cannot be more than 90 cyclists above him; otherwise, there would be not enough distinct cyclists overtaking Vasya consistently. 5. **Example of Achieving Position 91**: - To verify that 91st place is possible for Vasya, consider the following: - If in each stage, the 6 cyclists finishing ahead of Vasya are different, we then have 90 distinct cyclists who consistently finish ahead of him. - Assume these 90 cyclists have all different total times just ahead of Vasya. - The remaining 409 cyclists finish behind Vasya in every stage and thus have worse total times than him. - If Vasya's total time is consistently ( T_7 ) per stage, and assume ( T_7 ) is in the middle range as described. Thus, there's a concrete scenario where Vasya can end up at exactly the 91st rank, and no ties or inconsistencies occur amongst the other positions. # Conclusion: By the logical deduction and the specific construction of finish times, the lowest possible rank (highest number rank) Vasya can achieve, given his consistent 7th place in each stage among the 500 cyclists, is indeed: [ boxed{91} ]"},{"prompt":"A bag contains 4 purple, 3 orange, and 5 green chips.

Under this change of variables: [ p(x, y, z) = q(u, v, w) ] Given that ( t ) scales ( x, y, z ) uniformly, the functional equation ( p(tx, ty, tz) = t^2 f(y-x, z-x) ) implies: [ p(x, y, z) = f(y-x, z-x) = f(v, w) ] Thus, ( q(u, v, w) = f(v, w) ) is independent of ( u ). 4. **Form of the Polynomial**: Since ( q ) is quadratic and only in ( v ) and ( w ), we can express: [ p(x, y, z) = a(y-x)^2 + b(y-x)(z-x) + c(z-x)^2 ] Here, ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are constants to be determined. 5. **Determine Coefficients ( a, b, c )**: Using the provided values of ( p ): [ p(1, 0, 0) = 4 implies a(0-1)^2 + b(0-1)(0-1) + c(0-1)^2 = 4 ] [ a(1) + b(1) + c(1) = 4 implies a + b + c = 4 quad (1) ] [ p(0, 1, 0) = 5 implies a(1-0)^2 + b(1-0)(0-0) + c(0-0)^2 = 5 ] [ a(1) + b(0) + c(0) = 5 implies a = 5 quad (2) ] [ p(0, 0, 1) = 6 implies a(0-0)^2 + b(0-0)(1-0) + c(1-0)^2 = 6 ] [ a(0) + b(0) + c(1) = 6 implies c = 6 quad (3) ] Substitute ( a = 5 ) and ( c = 6 ) into equation (1): [ 5 + b + 6 = 4 implies b = -7 ] 6. **Final Polynomial**: The polynomial is: [ p(x, y, z) = 5(y - x)^2 - 7(y - x)(z - x) + 6(z - x)^2 ] 7. **Find Roots Based on Conditions**: For complex numbers ( alpha, beta, gamma ), such that ( p(alpha, beta, gamma) = 0 ), we have roots ( beta ) and ( gamma ) related by: [ frac{beta - alpha}{gamma - alpha} = frac{7 pm sqrt{71} i}{10} ] Given ( |beta - alpha| = 10 ): [ left| frac{beta - alpha}{gamma - alpha} right| = frac{sqrt{49 + 71}}{10} = frac{sqrt{120}}{10} = sqrt{12}/10 ] Thus: [ |gamma - alpha| = 10 times frac{10}{sqrt{120}} = frac{100}{sqrt{120}} = frac{100}{2sqrt{30}} = frac{50sqrt{30}}{30} = frac{5sqrt{30}}{3} ] [ boxed{frac{5 sqrt{30}}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"f the function f(x) = sin(omega x) (omega > 0) is monotonically increasing in the interval [0, frac{pi}{3}] and monotonically decreasing in the interval [frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{2}], then omega equals to ( ) A: 8 B: 2 C: frac{3}{2} D: frac{2}{3}","completion":"From the given conditions, we know that the function reaches its maximum value at x = frac{pi}{3}.

Let x be the number of 40 milliliter bottles and y be the number of 45 milliliter bottles. Thus, we have the equation: [ 40x + 45y = 720 ] 2. **Solve for possible values of x and y:** Let's start by considering simple multiples of 40 and 45 that could add up to 720. - 720 div 40 = 18, so x could be 18 with y = 0. - 720 div 45 = 16, so y could be 16 with x = 0. - Try mixed combinations: if x = 9 and y = 8, then 40(9) + 45(8) = 360 + 360 = 720. 3. **Select the combination with the minimum number of bottles:** The total number of bottles in each valid scenario: - x = 18, y = 0 Rightarrow 18 bottles. - x = 0, y = 16 Rightarrow 16 bottles. - x = 9, y = 8 Rightarrow 17 bottles.

Let ( b ), ( c ), and ( d ) represent the number of vertices painted with each of the three colors, respectively. 2. **Define ( a_k ) Variables:** For ( k = 1, 2, 3 ), we define ( a_k ) as the number of isosceles triangles whose vertices contain exactly ( k ) colors. 3. **Assumption and Purpose:** Assume for contradiction that there are no isosceles triangles with vertices of three different colors, i.e., ( a_3 = 0 ). 4. **Count the Pairs ((triangle, E)):** Let's count the number of pairs ((triangle, E)) where ( triangle ) is an isosceles triangle and ( E ) is a side of ( triangle ) with endpoints of different colors. 5. **Counting Using ( a_2 ):** Since ( a_3 = 0 ), each triangle counted must consist of exactly two colors. Thus, each such isosceles triangle can be associated with two distinct sides having endpoints of different colors. Hence, the total number of such pairs is ( 2a_2 ). 6. **Counting with Vertex Pairs (A, B):** Now, consider two vertices ( A ) and ( B ) of different colors. Since ( n ) is relatively prime to 6, it must be odd. For any pair of vertices of distinct colors, we can form three isosceles triangles having ( A ) and ( B ) as vertices. This arrangement is true because: - Two triangles where ( AB ) is not the base. - One triangle where ( AB ) is the base. Therefore, for any pair of vertices ( A ) and ( B ), there are three such pairs. Since ( b+c+d ) is odd, the overall count for any such chosen pairs (taking symmetry into account) is ( 3(bc + cd + db) ). 7. **Establish the Contradiction:** We now equate the pair counts from both methods: [ 2a_2 = 3(bc + cd + db) ] Since ( b ), ( c ), and ( d ) are each odd, ( bc + cd + db ) is an odd number. Multiplying this odd number by 3 gives an odd number. Hence, ( 3(bc + cd + db) ) is odd. However, ( 2a_2 ) is always even because it is two times an integer. We therefore have: [ 2a_2 quad text{is even} quad text{and} quad 3(bc + cd + db) quad text{is odd} ] Since an even number cannot equal an odd number, this yields a contradiction. 8. **Conclusion:** As the assumption led to a contradiction, ( a_3 = 0 ) is not possible.

Can it be the case that the equation ( f(f(x)) = 0 ) has three distinct roots, while the equation ( f(f(f(x))) = 0 ) has seven distinct roots?","completion":"To solve this problem, we will use the properties of the quadratic polynomial function and its roots. 1. Let the quadratic polynomial ( f(x) ) have the form: [ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ] Since the polynomial is given to be a quadratic trinomial, it can have at most two distinct roots. 2. Given that ( f(x) ) has two distinct roots, denote these roots as ( alpha ) and ( beta ). So, we have: [ f(x) = a(x - alpha)(x - beta) ] 3. Next, examine the equation ( f(f(x)) = 0 ). From this composition of functions, we need ( f(x) ) to satisfy ( f(x) = alpha ) or ( f(x) = beta ). 4. This means we need to solve for ( x ) in the following quadratic equations: [ f(x) = alpha quad text{and} quad f(x) = beta ] 5. Each of these quadratic equations can have at most two roots. Denote the roots of ( f(x) = alpha ) as ( x_{1} ) and ( x_{2} ), and the roots of ( f(x) = beta ) as ( x_{3} ) and ( x_{4} ). Thus: [ text{Roots of } f(f(x)) = 0 text{ are } x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, text{ and } x_{4} ] 6. However, the problem specifically asks if there can be exactly 3 distinct roots for ( f(f(x)) = 0 ). This is not possible because each of the quadratic equations (f(x) = alpha) and (f(x) = beta) will yield exactly two roots each. So, the number of distinct roots here will be either 2 or 4. 7. Now consider the equation ( f(f(f(x))) = 0 ). 8. For ( f(f(f(x))) = 0 ), we need: [ f(x) = x_{1}, f(x) = x_{2}, f(x) = x_{3}, text{ and } f(x)=x_{4} ] 9. Each of these must be solved to determine the maximum number of roots. If we examine the roots ( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 ) of ( f(f(x)) = 0 ), substituting each of these into ( f(x) ) results in solving four quadratic equations. 10. Each of these quadratic equations ( f(x) = x_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 ) can yield at most two distinct roots. Thus, the total number of distinct roots possible for ( f(f(f(x))) = 0 ) is: [ 4 times 2 = 8 ] However, it is possible for some roots to be repeated, but we must consider the maximum distinct possibilities. 11. Since we started by noting that ( f ) is quadratic (with exactly two roots which don't merge during the function compositions involved), having 7 distinct roots for ( f(f(f(x))) ) does not align with the provable maximum number of distinct roots (which aligns as multiples of roots counts for nesting equalities). # Conclusion: Thus, it is impossible for the equation ( f(f(x)) = 0 ) to have exactly 3 distinct roots.

This implies that the solutions to the equation must satisfy [-100 le x le 100.] Considering the graph of y = sin x and y = frac{x}{100}, we observe that the line y = frac{x}{100} intersects the sine curve multiple times within the interval [-100, 100]. The sine function has crests at x = (2k + frac{1}{2})pi for integers k, where its value reaches 1. Given that frac{100}{pi} approx 31.83, we find that the crest of the sine function at x = left( 30 + frac{1}{2} right) pi is the last one that intersects the line y = frac{x}{100} within the specified interval. This is because beyond this point, the slope of the line y = frac{x}{100} is less than the maximum value reached by the sine function, and thus, they do not intersect. For each interval of the form [2 pi k, 2 pi (k + 1)] where 0 le k le 15, the graph of y = frac{x}{100} intersects the graph of y = sin x exactly twice. This is because within each period of the sine function, the line intersects the sine curve once on the way up and once on the way down. Since there are 16 such intervals from 0 to 100 (inclusive of the endpoints), there are [2 times 16 = 32] solutions in the interval [0,100]. By symmetry, the same number of solutions exists in the interval [-100,0]. However, counting the solutions in both intervals separately includes the solution x = 0 twice. Therefore, we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting this solution.

This does not conclusively prove that alpha is parallel to beta without additional information. Therefore, statement A cannot be considered correct without further context. **Statement B**: If a is perpendicular to alpha, and alpha is perpendicular to beta, then a could either be parallel to beta or lie within the plane beta. This is because two planes perpendicular to the same line are not necessarily parallel; they could intersect. Thus, statement B does not necessarily hold true in all cases. **Statement C**: Given that a is perpendicular to alpha, b is parallel to beta, and alpha is parallel to beta, we can deduce the following: - Since alpha is parallel to beta, and a is perpendicular to alpha, it follows that a is also perpendicular to beta because the orientation of perpendicularity is preserved across parallel planes. - Consequently, if b is parallel to beta, and a is perpendicular to beta, then a must be perpendicular to b as well. This logical deduction confirms that statement C is correct. **Statement D**: If alpha cap gamma = a and beta cap gamma = b, with a parallel to b, it suggests that alpha and beta could either intersect or be parallel, as their intersection with gamma produces parallel lines.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step. Step 1: Identifying the Mid-Perpendicular Bisectors Given that each vertex of the polygon lies on the circle, it follows that the perpendicular bisectors of each side of the polygon must pass through the circle's center, (O). Denote these perpendicular bisectors as (e_1, e_2, ldots, e_n). Step 2: Reflecting Across Perpendicular Bisectors - Each point (A_i) on the polygon, when reflected across (e_i), yields the next point (A_{i+1}). - Reflecting (A_1) across (e_1) gives (A_2). - Reflecting (A_2) across (e_2) gives (A_3), and so on. - This continues until we return (A_{n+1}=A_1), closing the polygon. Step 3: Decomposing the Transformation To simplify and understand the transformation: 1. **Reflection Sequence:** The ordered sequence of reflections across these bisectors can be analyzed. 2. **Replacing with Simplified Transformation:** - It is known that two reflections over intersecting axes can be replaced by a rotation around the intersection point (the circle's center (O)) with twice the angle between the axes. - Each transformation (T_i) can then be represented by an appropriate simpler transformation. Step 4: Distinguishing Cases # Case 1: (n) is Even When (n) is even, the cumulative transformation (T) can be expressed as: [ T = left( T_1 cdot T_2 right) cdot left( T_3 cdot T_4 right) cdot ldots cdot left( T_{n-1} cdot T_n right) ] which simplifies to: [ T = F(2alpha_{12}) cdot F(2alpha_{34}) cdot ldots cdot F(2alpha_{n-1,n}) = Fleft(2 left( alpha_{12} + alpha_{34} + ldots + alpha_{n-1,n} right)right) ] Here, (F) indicates a rotation around (O). - This rotation will have a non-trivial fixed point if and only if the total rotation angle is a multiple of (360^circ). Thus, for some integer (k): [ 2(alpha_{12} + alpha_{34} + ldots + alpha_{n-1,n}) = k cdot 360^circ ] If this condition holds, every point on the circle is a fixed point indicating infinite solutions. # Case 2: (n) is Odd When (n) is odd, the cumulative transformation (T) takes the form: [ T = left( T_1 cdot T_2 right) cdot left( T_3 cdot T_4 right) cdot ldots cdot left( T_{n-2} cdot T_{n-1} right) cdot T_n ] Simplified, this is: [ T = F(2alpha_{12}) cdot F(2alpha_{34}) cdot ldots cdot F(2alpha_{n-2,n-1}) cdot T_n = Fleft(2(alpha_{12} + alpha_{34} + ldots + alpha_{n-2, n-1})right) cdot T_n ] This is an overall transformation by rotation followed by one reflection. - Such transformation (rotation followed by reflection) leaves exactly two points on the circle fixed, indicating only two distinct solutions. Conclusion - For (n) even: - The problem has infinite solutions if the sum condition holds: (sum alpha_{ij} = k cdot 180^circ). - Otherwise, there are no solutions. - For (n) odd: - The construction yields exactly two valid inscribed polygons. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Suppose f(x) is defined for all real numbers x; f(x) > 0 for all x; and f(a)f(b) = f(a + b) for all a and b.

We are given a quadrilateral (ABCD) inscribed in circle (odot O), with (AD parallel OC) and the area relation (S_{AODC} = 2 cdot S_{triangle DBC}). 2. We aim to show (AB = 2 cdot BC). 3. Let's start by establishing the area relationships. Since (AD parallel OC), triangles (AOD) and (OCD) are similar. 4. The combined area of (AOD) and (OCD) can be written as: S_{triangle AOD} + S_{triangle OCD} = S_{AODC} 5. According to the given information: S_{AODC} = 2 cdot S_{triangle DBC} 6.

Determine which of these statements are correct (Write down all the correct statement numbers).","completion":"For statement ①, by taking the midpoint of segment BC as the origin of coordinates and line BC as the x-axis, we have B(-3,0) and C(3,0). The equation 4sin B=5sin C gives us 4b=5c. Let A(m,n), then we can write: 4sqrt{(m-3)^2 + n^2} = 5sqrt{(m+3)^2 + n^2}. Squaring both sides, we obtain: 16(m^2+n^2-6m+9) = 25(m^2+n^2+6m+9), which simplifies to: m^2 + n^2 + frac{82}{3}m + 9 = 0. Re-arranging gives us the equation of a circle: (m+frac{41}{3})^2 + n^2 = left(frac{40}{3}right)^2. This implies the locus of point A is a circle centered at left(- frac{41}{3},0right) with radius frac{40}{3}. Therefore, the maximum area of triangle ABC is given by frac{1}{2} times 6 times frac{40}{3} = 40. Hence, statement ① is correct. For statement ②, we have a=6, and from 4sin B=5sin C, we get 4b=5c. Let b=5t and c=4t. Using Pythagoras’ theorem a^2 = b^2 + c^2, we get 36 + 16t^2 = 25t^2, leading to t=frac{4}{3}. This implies that a right-angled triangle is possible, so statement ② is incorrect. For statement ③, with a=6, 4sin B=5sin C, and A=2C, we get B=pi - 3C. From the Law of Sines, we have 4b=5c, thus b=frac{5c}{4}. Applying the Law of Sines again leads to: frac{frac{5c}{4}}{sin(pi-3C)} = frac{c}{sin C} = frac{frac{5c}{4}}{sin C(4cos^2 C - 1)}, which simplifies, as sin C neq 0, to: 4cos^2 C - 1 = frac{5}{4}. Solving this equation yields cos C = frac{3}{4} (the negative root is discarded as it is not in the range of cosine for a triangle). Then we find sin C = sqrt{1 - cos^2 C} = frac{sqrt{7}}{4}, and consequently, sin A = 2sin C cos C = 2 times frac{3}{4} times frac{sqrt{7}}{4} = frac{3sqrt{7}}{8}. From this, we derive that c = 4 and b = 5; thus, the perimeter is a+b+c=15. Hence, statement ③ is correct. For statement ④, with a=6, 4sin B=5sin C, and A=2C, we get B=pi - 3C. By the Law of Sines, 4b=5c leads to b=frac{5c}{4}. Reapplying the Law of Sines: frac{frac{5c}{4}}{sin(pi-3C)} = frac{c}{sin C} = frac{frac{5c}{4}}{sin C(4cos^2 C - 1)}. Again, disregarding the negative root, we find sin C = frac{sqrt{7}}{4}. Then, sin A = frac{3sqrt{7}}{8}, c=4, and b=5. The area of triangle ABC is determined as S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}bcsin A = frac{15sqrt{7}}{4}. Assume the inradius of triangle ABC is R, so R=frac{2S}{a+b+c}=frac{2timesfrac{15sqrt{7}}{4}}{15}=frac{sqrt{7}}{2}. Finally, the area of triangle AOB is computed as: S_{triangle AOB} = frac{1}{2}cR = frac{1}{2} times 4 times frac{sqrt{7}}{2} = boxed{sqrt{7}}. Therefore, statement ④ is correct.

This process involves several steps: 1. **Clearing the Denominators**: We multiply both sides of the equation by 3jk to eliminate the fractions. This gives us: [3jk left(frac{1}{j}right) + 3jk left(frac{1}{k}right) = 3jk left(frac{1}{3}right)] Simplifying each term, we get: [3k + 3j = jk] 2. **Re-arranging the Equation**: To make this equation easier to solve, we want to get all the terms on one side. By moving all terms to one side, we aim to factor the expression. The equation becomes: [jk - 3j - 3k = 0] Adding 9 to both sides (a step inspired by Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick to make the expression factorable), we get: [jk - 3j - 3k + 9 = 9] 3. **Factoring the Equation**: The equation now looks like a quadratic equation in disguise. By factoring, we find: [(j-3)(k-3) = 9] This equation suggests that j-3 and k-3 are pairs of factors of 9. 4. **Finding Pairs of Factors of 9**: The positive factors of 9 are 1, 3, 9.

Let us consider the given scenario where two points ( P ) and ( Q ) are inside the square ( ABCD ). We are given that (angle PAQ = angle PCQ = 45^circ ). 2. To prove the required identity, we will use geometric transformations. 3. First, rotate (triangle AQD) by (90^circ) counterclockwise around point (A) to obtain (triangle AQ'B). This implies that points (D) and (Q) are moved to points (B) and (Q') respectively. 4. Similarly, rotate (triangle CQD) by (90^circ) clockwise around point (C) to get (triangle CQ''B). Thus, points (D) and (Q) are moved to points (B) and (Q'') respectively. 5.

Since this triangle is right-angled, the median to the hypotenuse ( s_c ) will be half of the hypotenuse ((frac{1}{2}sqrt{(2a)^2 + (2b)^2} )) due to the properties of the right triangle medians. 3. **Right Triangle Constructed from Medians**: Now, consider a triangle where the sides are the medians of the original triangle: - ( s_a ) is the median to ( BC ) - ( s_b ) is the median to ( AC ) - ( s_c ) is the median to ( AB ) According to the problem, this new triangle is also right-angled. 4. **Calculating Medians**: - For ( s_a ), we have: [ s_a = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2(2b)^2 + 2(2a)^2 - (2b)^2} = sqrt{4b^2 + a^2} ] - For ( s_b ), we have: [ s_b = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2(2a)^2 + 2(2b)^2 - (2a)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ] - For ( s_c ), as previously noted, it is half the hypotenuse, so: [ s_c = frac{1}{2} sqrt{(2a)^2 + (2b)^2} = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ] 5. **Verifying the Triangle Formed by Medians**: Since the triangle formed by medians is right-angled and ( s_c ) is the hypotenuse, we have the relationship: [ s_a^2 + s_b^2 = s_c^2 ] Substituting the values calculated: [ (sqrt{4b^2 + a^2})^2 + (sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 ] Simplifying, [ 4b^2 + a^2 + a^2 + b^2 = 2a^2 + 5b^2 ] [ 2a^2 + 5b^2 = (sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 ] Giving us: [ 2a^2 + 5b^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 ] This simplifies down to: [ a^2 = 2 b^2 implies a = sqrt{2} b ] 6. **Ratio of Sides**: The ratio of the side lengths of the original triangle is: [ frac{2a}{2b} = frac{a}{b} = sqrt{2} ] 7. **Ratios of Sides in the Right Triangle Constructed by Medians**: - The ratio of the sides of the new triangle constructed from medians is: [ frac{s_a}{s_b} = frac{sqrt{4b^2 + a^2}}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = frac{sqrt{4b^2 + 2b^2}}{sqrt{2b^2 + a^2}} = sqrt{frac{6b^2}{3b^2}} = sqrt{2} ] 8. **Conclusion**: - Both triangles, the original right triangle, and the triangle formed by its medians, satisfy: [ frac{a}{b} = sqrt{2} ] Since the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal and the included angles are equal ((90^circ)), by the definition of similarity of triangles, the two triangles are similar.

Show that the last number written on the board is odd.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup:** Consider the integers from 1 to 2018 written on the board. The sum of these integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{2018} i = frac{2018 cdot (2018 + 1)}{2} = frac{2018 cdot 2019}{2} ] 2. **Simplification of the Sum:** Simplify the sum: [ S = 1009 cdot 2019 ] Since 2019 is odd, multiplying it by any number (specifically 1009, which is irrelevant to its odd nature in this proof) results in an odd product. Thus, ( S ) is odd. 3. **Operation Analysis:** Consider the operation where we choose two numbers ( a ) and ( b ), erase them, and write the absolute value of their difference, ( |a - b| ). This operation changes the numbers on the board, but affects their sum as follows: [ a + b rightarrow |a - b| ] Let's analyze the change in the overall sum: - Before the operation, the sum involving ( a ) and ( b ) is ( a + b ). - After the operation, the modified sum becomes ( |a - b| ). Therefore, the change in the sum due to this operation is: [ Delta S = (a + b) - |a - b| ] 4. **Parity of Change in Sum:** The change in sum can be written as follows (depending on ( a ) and ( b )): [ Delta S = (a + b) - (b - a) = 2a quad text{or} quad Delta S = (a + b) - (a - b) = 2b ] In both cases, the change ( 2a ) or ( 2b ) is always even.
