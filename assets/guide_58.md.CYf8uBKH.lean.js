Substituting this into the first equation: [ frac{1}{4^x} + frac{1}{27^y} = frac{5}{6} ] Becomes: [ frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{a} = frac{5}{6} ] Since: [ frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{a} leq frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{b+1} ] Thus: [ frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{b + 1} leq frac{5}{6} ] 4.

Assume without loss of generality that the complex origin lies at the center of Gamma. 3. **Introducing complex roots of unity**: Let omega = e^{i pi / 3}, which is a primitive 6th root of unity and also represents a 60° rotation in the complex plane. Note that omega^3 = e^{i pi} = -1 and omega^6 = 1. Also, omega^2 = e^{i 2pi / 3}, which we denote by j. 4. **Expression for points on the circle**: Since AB = CD = EF = R and the points are placed in trigonometric (counterclockwise) order, each pair (A, B), (C, D), and (E, F) is separated by pi/3 radians.

Can the remaining cells of the board be tiled with dominoes? (A domino is a 1 times 2 or 2 times 1 rectangle.)","completion":"1. Consider a (10 times 10) chessboard with 10 rooks placed such that no two rooks attack each other. This implies that there is exactly one rook in each row and each column. Let the coordinates of the rooks be ((r_i, c_i)) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 10). 2. Define (s_i) as the sum of the row number and the column number where the (i)-th rook is placed. Since the rooks do not attack each other, each row number (r_i) and each column number (c_i) appears exactly once in the set of indices. Therefore, the sum of all these indices is: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} s_i = sum_{i=1}^{10} (r_i + c_i) ] 3. Note that (sum_{i=1}^{10} r_i = 1 + 2 + cdots + 10) and (sum_{i=1}^{10} c_i = 1 + 2 + cdots + 10). Hence: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} s_i = 2 cdot (1 + 2 + cdots + 10) ] 4. Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) natural numbers, (1 + 2 + cdots + 10 = frac{10 cdot 11}{2} = 55). Therefore: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} s_i = 2 cdot 55 = 110 ] 5. Since (110) is an even number, the sum of all (s_i) is even. This implies that the number of rooks positioned such that (s_i) is even must itself be even. Consequently, the number of rooks with odd (s_i) must also be even. 6. Now color the chessboard in a checkerboard pattern, with the bottom-left cell colored black. In this coloring, the sum (s_i = r_i + c_i) is even if and only if the cell ((r_i, c_i)) is black, and odd if and only if the cell is white. 7. Without loss of generality, assume a certain number of rooks are on black cells and the rest on white cells. Since the number of even (s_i) (corresponding to black cells) is even, and the number of rooks is 10, if we denote the number of rooks on black cells as (k), (k) must be an even number less than or equal to 10. 8. Given each domino covers one black and one white cell, we can infer the following: - There are (50) black and (50) white cells in total on the (10 times 10) board. - With (10) rooks placed, there remain (90) cells to be covered by dominos. - As each domino covers one black and one white cell, the remaining cells should consist of the same number of black and white cells. 9. However, if the number of rooks on black cells ((k)) is even, then the placement of the remaining rooks on white cells implies an imbalance in the number of black and white cells left unoccupied by rooks. Conclusion: Since the remaining number of black and white cells to be covered by dominos differ after placing rooks, it is impossible to tile the rest of the board with (1 times 2) or (2 times 1) dominos perfectly.

Now, let's consider the possible digit lengths: - If the digit length is 6, the number would look like this: ABCCBA. Since the first and last digits can only be 6 or 8, we have 2 choices for A. For B and C, we can have any digit from 0 to 9, which gives us 10 choices for each. So, the total number of 6-digit palindromic integers would be 2 * 10 * 10 = 200. - If the digit length is more than 6, the number of palindromic integers would be greater than 200 because we would have more positions to fill with 10 choices each, which would result in more combinations. - If the digit length is less than 6, we cannot satisfy the condition that the number is greater than 500000. Therefore, the digit length of these palindromic integers is boxed{6} ."},{"prompt":"a class of 60 students, 41 are taking French, 22 are taking German.

According to the problem, there are 60 students in total.

We know that 41 students are taking French and 22 are taking German. If we add these two numbers, we get the total number of enrollments in French and German courses, not the total number of students, because some students are counted twice (those who are taking both languages). So, the sum of students taking French and German is ( 41 + 22 = 63 ) enrollments. However, since we know that only 54 students are actually taking at least one language, the difference between the number of enrollments and the number of students will give us the number of students who are counted twice (those taking both courses).

We factor (g(n) = n^3 - 550) to find its roots. Setting (g(n) = 0), we have: [ n^3 = 550 implies n = sqrt[3]{550} ] This value is not an integer, and hence (g(n)) does not have rational roots.

Look at the following sums: [ x_{1}, , x_{1} + x_{2}, , dots, , x_{1} + x_{2} + dots + x_{n} ] There are ( n ) such sums. If any of these sums is a multiple of ( n ), the lemma is proven.

Divide the five integers into these three equivalence classes. - If all equivalence classes are non-empty, we can form a sum using one integer from each, yielding a sum divisible by 3. - If one class is empty, at least three integers must remain in the other two classes. Choose any subset sum of three integers from these classes. - **Lemma 3:** Given five integers, some of them red, it is possible to choose a subset such that its sum and the count of red integers within it are both multiples of 3. **Proof of Lemma 3:** - If all integers are red, use Lemma 2 directly. - If two or fewer integers are red, use Lemma 1 to pick a subset that has a count of red numbers which is a multiple of 3. - **Case Specific Breakouts - If there are three red numbers and two blue numbers:** - If the sum of the three red numbers is a multiple of 3, choose them. - Otherwise, select one of the blue numbers if it balances modulo 3 with the three red sums. - **If there are four red numbers and one blue number:** - If the blue number is a multiple of 3, add it to the required sum as needed. - Otherwise, distribute the red's modular sums within the three possible mats. 4. **Combining Results:** From Lemmas 1, 2, and 3, it’s possible to iteratively select groups of numbers satisfying both conditions: - At least one group sums to multiples of 2013. - The remaining count of groups satisfying subsets of red integers sums to multiples of 3. 5. **Final Insight:** With 2015 integers, iterative selection of possible sets yields solutions that satisfy A's target sums for multiples of 2013.

The function y=f(x) has f(1+x)=f(1-x) for any real number x, and the function f(x) is monotonic on [1,+infty), implying that the function f(x) is symmetric about the line x=1. The sequence {a_{n}} is an arithmetic sequence with a non-zero common difference, and f(a_{6})=f(a_{23}), implying that a_{6}+a_{23}=2.

This means ( a_{100} = a_1 ), and generally ( a_{99+k} = a_k ). 4. **Define ( b_i ) Values**: We assign a value ( b_i ) for each adjacent pair ( (a_i, a_{i+1}) ): - ( b_i = 0 ) if ( a_i = a_{i+1} ) - ( b_i = 1 ) if ((a_i, a_{i+1})) is ((1, 2)), ((2, 3)), or ((3, 1)) - ( b_i = -1 ) if ((a_i, a_{i+1})) is ((1, 3)), ((2, 1)), or ((3, 2)) 5. **Compute Initial Sum ( S )**: We calculate the sum ( S ) of all ( b_i ) for the initial sequence: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{98} b_i ] Breaking it down: - (49) pairs of ((1, 2)): each contributes (1) (total (49)) - (48) pairs of ((2, 1)): each contributes (-1) (total (-48)) - (1) pair of ((2, 3)): contributes (1) (total (1)) - (1) pair of ((3, 1)): contributes (1) (total (1)) [ S = 49 - 48 + 1 + 1 = 3 ] 6. **Behavior Under Allowed Move**: Each allowed move changes ( a_i ) and affects ( b_{i-1} ) and ( b_i ). - If ( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} ), then ( b_{i-1} + b_i = 0 ), making the net change zero. - If ( a_{i-1} neq a_{i+1} ), we cannot change ( a_i ), maintaining ( S ).

We need to prove the following: [ frac{PA_1}{AB} + frac{PB_1}{BC} + frac{PC_1}{CA} = 1 ] Step-by-step proof: 1. **Introduce areas and parallel lines concept:** Since P lies inside triangle ABC, let’s consider the areas of the smaller triangles formed by the lines p_1, p_2 and p_3. 2. **Use the properties of parallel lines and similar triangles:** - The ray p_1 is parallel to AB, so triangle PA_1C sim triangle ABC. - The ray p_2 is parallel to BC, so triangle PB_1A sim triangle ABC. - The ray p_3 is parallel to CA, so triangle PC_1B sim triangle ABC. 3. **Express the area ratios:** From the similarity of the triangles, we have the ratio of the areas: [ frac{[PA_1C]}{[ABC]} = left(frac{PA_1}{AB}right)^2, quad frac{[PB_1A]}{[ABC]} = left(frac{PB_1}{BC}right)^2, quad frac{[PC_1B]}{[ABC]} = left(frac{PC_1}{CA}right)^2. ] 4. **Relate segment ratios to area ratios:** Since triangle PA_1C, triangle PB_1A, and triangle PC_1B are similar to triangle ABC, the sum of their areas is equal to the area of triangle ABC. 5. **Sum of the ratios:** [ left(frac{PA_1}{AB}right)^2 + left(frac{PB_1}{BC}right)^2 + left(frac{PC_1}{CA}right)^2 = 1 ] 6. **Considering that ratios of line segments add up directly:** Here, since the areas are summed up and using properties of parallel lines forming similar segments: [ frac{PA_1}{AB} + frac{PB_1}{BC} + frac{PC_1}{CA} = 1 quad text{(sum of proportions over whole triangle ABC)} ] Conclusion: Thus, we have: [ frac{PA_1}{AB} + frac{PB_1}{BC} + frac{PC_1}{CA} = 1 ] This relationship holds for all points within the convex hull of triangle ABC or on the boundary of triangle ABC.

During subsequent steps, we select a black cell adjacent to a yellow cell and color it blue. Then we color all its white neighbors within the figure yellow. 3. **Connectedness and Number of Steps:** Since the figure is connected and there are exactly k black cells, it takes exactly k steps to recolor all black cells into blue: - On the first step, we recolor potentially up to five cells (one black and at most four white neighbors). - On each of the next k-1 steps, we recolor at most four cells (one black and at most three white neighbors), because each selected black cell is adjacent to a previously colored yellow cell. 4. **Total Number of Cells:** To compute the total number of cells in the figure: - First step: up to 5 cells. - Each of the following k−1 steps: up to 4 cells per step.

Simplifying, we get: [ {e_1}^2 cdot {e_2}^2 = left(1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}right) cdot left(1 + frac{a^2}{b^2}right) = 2 + frac{b^2}{a^2} + frac{a^2}{b^2} geqslant 2 + 2sqrt{frac{b^2}{a^2} cdot frac{a^2}{b^2}} = 4 ] This inequality follows from the AM-GM inequality, where the equality holds if and only if a = b. Therefore, we conclude that e_1 cdot e_2 geqslant 2, making statement ③ correct. 4. **Statement ④ Analysis**: The half-focal distance c for both hyperbolas is the same, sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. This means the foci of both hyperbolas are equidistant from the origin, implying that they lie on the same circle centered at the origin with radius c. Thus, statement ④ is correct.

However, the solution provided in the question indicates that the correct answer is supposed to be based on the number of correct conclusions, which appears to be a misunderstanding in the provided solution.

We have two rectangular strips of paper with lengths (9) and (7), both cut from an original strip of length ( 16 ). The width of both strips is assumed to be constant and identical. 2. We know the area of the table covered only by the left strip is ( 27 ) and the area covered only by the right strip is ( 18 ). 3. Denote by ( S ) the area covered by both strips. 4. Since the width of the strips is the same, the areas of the strips are proportional to their lengths. Therefore, if we let ( 9w ) and ( 7w ) be the areas of the strips, where ( w ) is the common width, we have the relation between the areas proportional to their lengths, i.e., ( frac{9}{7} ). 5. Set up the equation to account for the total area covered by each strip. The area covered by the left strip includes the area covered by both strips plus the area not covered by the right strip: [ 27 + S ] Similarly, the area covered by the right strip includes the area covered by both strips plus the area not covered by the left strip: [ 18 + S ] 6. Since the ratio of the lengths is ( 9:7 ), we set up the proportion: [ frac{27 + S}{18 + S} = frac{9}{7} ] 7.

What is the ratio of the amount of almond butter needed to make a batch of cookies to the amount in a jar?","completion":"First, let's find out the cost of a jar of almond butter. Since a jar of almond butter costs three times the amount of a jar of peanut butter, and a jar of peanut butter costs 3, the cost of a jar of almond butter is: 3 times 3 = 3 * 3 = 9 Now, we know that it costs 3 more per batch to make almond butter cookies instead of peanut butter cookies. Since the only difference in cost between the two types of cookies is the type of butter used, we can assume that the extra 3 cost for the almond butter cookies is due to the almond butter itself. Therefore, the amount of almond butter needed to make a batch of cookies costs 3, which is the additional cost when compared to making peanut butter cookies. Now, we have a jar of almond butter that costs 9, and we know that 3 worth of almond butter is needed for a batch of cookies. To find the ratio of the amount of almond butter needed for a batch of cookies to the amount in a jar, we divide the cost for a batch by the cost of a jar: 3 (cost for a batch) / 9 (cost of a jar) = 1/3 So, the ratio of the amount of almond butter needed to make a batch of cookies to the amount in a jar is boxed{1:3} ."},{"prompt":"Given ( f(z) = C_{0} z^{n} + C_{1} z^{n1} + C_{2} z^{n2} + cdots + C_{n1} z + C_{n} ), which is a polynomial of degree ( n ) with complex coefficients.

Substitute these results back into the sum, (noting also that (omega^n = 1)): [ sum_{k=1}^n f(omega^k eta) = n (C_0 eta^n + C_n) ] 8. For ( n = 1 ), observe that the above expression holds true trivially as well. Thus, for any ( n in mathbb{N} ), we have: [ sum_{k=1}^n f(omega^k eta) = n (C_0 eta^n + C_n) ] 9.

The length of an integer is the number of prime factors (counting multiplicity) that make up the number. To maximize the length, we should use the smallest prime, which is 2, as many times as possible because using larger primes would reduce the number of factors we can have. Given that the maximum possible sum of the lengths of x and y is 16, we can distribute this sum between x and y in various ways. However, to maximize x + 3y, we should allocate as much of the length to y as possible. If we give y a length of 15 (the maximum possible while leaving at least a length of 1 for x), y would be 2^15 (since we're using the smallest prime to maximize the length).

By defining a parallelogram transformation, (K) and (M) are the resulting vertices of the parallelogram when parallel translations along vectors (overline{BC}) and (overline{BA}) are performed. Therefore, the quadrilateral (ACKM) is a parallelogram. The diagonals of this parallelogram have the sides of lengths (a) and (b) and an angle (alpha) between them. 2. **Translation along vector (overrightarrow{BA}):** When we translate the diagonal (BD) along the vector (overrightarrow{BA}), the segment (BD) shifts to the segment (AM). 3. **Translation along vector (overrightarrow{BC}):** Similarly, when (BD) is translated along the vector (overrightarrow{BC}), the segment (BD) shifts to the segment (CK). 4. **Formation of the Parallelogram:** Hence, the quadrilateral (ACKM) becomes a parallelogram with sides (a) and (b) and the angle between them is (alpha). 5. **Finding the minimal perimeter:** To determine the quadrilateral (ABCD) with the minimal perimeter, let's analyze the following expressions: Since (AB = DM), (BC = DK), (CD = DA), and (DA = DC), we consider the lengths: [ AB + BC + CD + DA = DM + DC + DK + DA ] This can further be expressed as: [ (DM + DC) + (DK + DA) geqslant CM + AK = NC + NM + NA + NK ] From the triangle inequality, the sum of these distances is minimized, proving that (N) coincides with (D).

Define point ( P ) as the intersection of the diagonals of the parallelepiped and let ( PQ ) be the perpendicular to the plane ( B D C_{1} ). It is evident that point ( P ) is equidistant from the vertices of triangle ( D C_{1} B ), making ( Q ) the center of the circle circumscribing the triangle. Since this triangle is acute-angled and isosceles, point ( Q ) lies on the segment ( C_{1} O ). 4. The angle between the line ( B D_{1} ) and the plane ( B D C_{1} ) is the acute angle ( alpha ) between ( left(B D_{1}right) ) and its orthogonal projection onto ( left(B D C_{1}right) ), which is the angle ( P B Q ). 5.

For scenario 1: The probability of the husband being selected is 1/7. The probability of the wife not being selected is 1 - the probability of her being selected, which is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.

[ z = frac{(2)(1) - (2)(i) - (i)(1) + (i)(i)}{(1)(1) + (1)(-i) + (i)(1) - (i)(i)} ] [ z = frac{2 - 2i - i - i^2}{1 - i + i - i^2} ] Step 3: Recall that i^2 = -1, and simplify the expression. [ z = frac{2 - 2i - i + 1}{1 + 1} ] [ z = frac{3 - 3i}{2} ] [ z = frac{3}{2} - frac{3i}{2} ] Step 4: Split the real and imaginary parts. [ z = frac{1}{2} - frac{3i}{2} ] The real part is frac{1}{2}, and the imaginary part is -frac{3}{2}. Therefore, the point corresponding to the complex number z in the complex plane is (frac{1}{2}, -frac{3}{2}).

We introduce a lemma: There exists a permutation of all non-empty subsets of ( G_n ) such that ( P_1 = {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ), ( P_{2^n - 1} = {n} ), ( P_{2^n - 2} neq G_n ), and ( |P_i cap P_{i+1}| = 1 ) for all ( i ). 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that for ( G_n ), there exists a type 2 permutation of subsets that starts and ends with two-element subsets, and the last subset does not contain ( n ). 3. **Base Case:** For ( n = 4 ), we need to construct the permutation explicitly. Consider the subsets of ( G_4 = {1, 2, 3, 4} ): [ {1, 2}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3}, {1, 3, 4}, {3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}, {2, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 3} ] This sequence satisfies the condition ( |P_i cap P_{i+1}| = 2 ). 4. **Inductive Step:** Suppose the hypothesis holds for ( G_n ). We need to show it holds for ( G_{n+1} ). - By the lemma, there exists a type 1 permutation of ( G_n ). Add ( n+1 ) to every set in this permutation. The first subset becomes ( {1, 2, ldots, n-1, n+1} ) and the last one becomes ( {n, n+1} ). Every two consecutive subsets now have two elements in common (the one they had before and ( n+1 )). - By induction, there is a type 2 permutation of ( G_n ) where the last element is a two-element subset that does not contain ( n ). Let this permutation be ( R ). - Combine the sequences ( R ) and ( Q ) (the modified type 1 permutation). The last element in ( R ) has two elements in common with the first subset in ( Q ). The combined sequence ( RQ ) ends with ( {n, n+1} ). To avoid this, reverse the order of the combined sequence. 5. **Proof of Lemma:** - Consider a type 1 permutation of ( G_n ): ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{2^n - 1} ) where ( P_1 = {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ) and ( P_{2^n - 1} = {n} ). - Write this sequence twice, but reverse the second sequence: ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{2^n - 1}, P_{2^n - 1}, P_{2^n - 2}, ldots, P_1 ). - Add ( n+1 ) to every second subset in this sequence and append ( {n+1} ) at the end. - The first subset is ( {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ) and the last subset is ( {n+1} ). The subset before the last is ( {1, 2, ldots, n-1, n+1} ), which is not ( G_{n+1} ). - Swap the first subset with one of the subsets ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) that does not contain ( n+1 ). 6. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for any ( n geq 4 ), there exists a permutation of the subsets of ( G_n ) that satisfies the given conditions.

Assume the claim of the problem is false and for definiteness, let us assume angle A_{2}M_{2}N_{2} < 90^{circ}. We will derive a contradiction from this assumption. 3. Construct a circle using O A_{2} as the diameter, where O is the center of the original circumscribed circle of the n-gon. 4. Observe that angle O M_{2}A_{2} = angle O M_{3}A_{3} = 90^{circ}, meaning points M_{2} and M_{3} lie on this newly constructed circle since angles subtended by the diameter of a circle are right angles (Thales' theorem). 5. Since M_{2}N_{2} geq 1 and O A_{2} = 1, the point N_{2} cannot lie inside the circle constructed on O A_{2}. 6. Let P be the point where the cut M_{2}N_{2} intersects with the constructed circle (potentially, P could coincide with N_{2}). 7. Notice that angle P M_{2}A_{2} = angle P M_{3}A_{3} and hence angle A_{2}M_{2}N_{2} > angle A_{2}M_{2}N_{2}, leading to our contradiction. 8.

Such inequality chain generates a logical inconsistency: [ angle A_{2}M_{2}N_{2} > angle A_{2}M_{2}N_{2} ] 10. Hence the assumption that angle A_{2}M_{2}N_{2} < 90^{circ} is false based on contradiction logic. 11.

After a 15% reduction, the new price of petrol per gallon becomes 0.85P dollars (since 100% - 15% = 85%). The motorist can buy 7 more gallons for 300 with the reduced price. So, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation: Original amount of petrol (in gallons) with 300 = 300 / P Additional petrol (in gallons) with reduced price = 7 gallons New amount of petrol (in gallons) with 300 = 300 / (0.85P) According to the problem, the new amount of petrol is 7 gallons more than the original amount, so we can write: 300 / (0.85P) = 300 / P + 7 Now, let's solve for P: 1 / (0.85P) = 1 / P + 7 / 300 To clear the denominators, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 0.85P * P * 300: 300 * P * 0.85 = 300 * 0.85P + 7 * 0.85P * P Now, let's simplify: 255P = 255P + 5.95P^2 Since 255P is on both sides of the equation, we can subtract it from both sides: 0 = 5.95P^2 This equation implies that P^2 = 0, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because the price of petrol cannot be zero.

First, let's get all the x terms on one side of the equation by subtracting 0.6667 * x from both sides: 0.6667 * x + 1 - 0.6667 * x = 0.75 * x - 0.6667 * x This simplifies to: 1 = 0.75 * x - 0.6667 * x Combine like terms: 1 = (0.75 - 0.6667) * x 1 = 0.0833 * x Now, to find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.0833: x = 1 / 0.0833 x ≈ 12 So, the number we are looking for is approximately boxed{12} ."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, if the measure of angle C is triple the measure of angle B and angle B measures 15^circ, what is the measure of angle A?","completion":"In triangle ABC, given that angle C = 3 times angle B and angle B = 15^circ, we can calculate angle C as follows: [ angle C = 3 times 15^circ = 45^circ ] The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180^circ.

We need to determine the maximum number of terms that such a sequence can contain, given that every number in the sequence does not exceed 1967. 1. **Observation on Maximum Term**: It's important to note that the largest term in the sequence can only be one of the initial terms a_0 or a_1. This is because each subsequent term a_k for k geq 2 is formed by taking the absolute difference of two preceding terms: [ a_k = |a_{k-2} - a_{k-1}| ] Hence, a_k leq max(a_{k-1}, a_{k-2}), meaning no term beyond the second can be greater than the maximum of the first two terms. 2. **Addressing Initial Conditions**: To maximize the length of the sequence, it's logical to start with the largest allowable value. Without loss of generality, let us set a_0 = n and a_1 = 1, where n leq 1967. 3. **Pattern Recognition**: Considering this starting point: [ begin{aligned} & a_0 = n & a_1 = 1 & a_2 = |n - 1| = n - 1 & a_3 = |1 - (n - 1)| = n - 2 & a_4 = |(n - 1) - (n - 2)| = 1 & a_5 = |(n - 2) - 1| = n - 3 end{aligned} ] Continuing this process, we see that every second term will be 1, and the terms in between slowly decrement down from n-1, n-2, n-3, ldots. 4. **Generalizing the Sequence**: Essentially, the sequence follows: [ n, 1, n-1, 1, n-2, 1, ldots ] where the non-one terms decrement by 1 in each step until reaching 1. 5. **Deriving the Length Formula**: Let’s denote the sequence length by k_n for a starting term n. We observe the relation: [ k_n = 3 + k_{n-2} ] - This recurrence means every time n is decremented by 2, the maximum length extends by 3 (corresponding to n, 1, n-1, ldots). 6. **Calculating the Length**: We solve for the sequence length via the recursive relation: [ begin{aligned} & k_1 = 2, & k_2 = 3, & k_3 = 5, & k_4 = 6, & k_5 = 8, & vdots & k_n = leftlfloor frac{3n + 1}{2} rightrfloor end{aligned} ] 7. **Final Calculation for n = 1967**: Plugging n = 1967 into the formula: [ k_{1967} = leftlfloor frac{3 times 1967 + 1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{5901 + 1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2951 rightrfloor = 2951 ] # Conclusion: The maximum number of terms such a sequence can contain is: [ boxed{2951} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the largest integer y such that frac{y}{4}+frac{3}{7} < frac{7}{4}?","completion":"1. **Eliminate fractions**: Multiply through by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 28: [ 28left(frac{y}{4} + frac{3}{7}right) < 28cdotfrac{7}{4} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 7y + 12 < 49 ] 2. **Isolate y**: Subtract 12 from both sides: [ 7y < 37 ] Divide both sides by 7: [ y < frac{37}{7} approx 5.2857 ] 3. **Find the largest integer y**: The largest integer less than 5.2857 is 5.

This equation implies that the left side, dfrac{n+1000}{70}, must be an integer because the right side, lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor, is defined as the greatest integer not exceeding sqrt{n}, which is always an integer. 2. **Identifying Key Properties**: - The equation suggests that as n increases, both sides of the equation will increase. However, the rate of increase will differ because the left side increases linearly with n, while the right side increases at a rate that slows down as n increases (since it is tied to sqrt{n}). - It's noted that n must be congruent to 50 pmod{70} for the left side to be an integer. This is because when n = 50, n+1000 = 1050 is divisible by 70, and adding 70k (where k is an integer) to n keeps the left side an integer. 3. **Finding Intersection Points**: - The observation that the graphs of (n+1000)/70 and sqrt[]{n} intersect at 2 points is crucial. These intersections represent the values of n where the linear increase on the left side matches the slower, square root-based increase on the right side. - To find these intersections, we start by testing values of n that are congruent to 50 pmod{70}, as established earlier. We begin with n=20 and n=21 (noting that these are initial guesses and we adjust our approach based on the congruence condition). - Upon further inspection, the correct approach involves starting with values of n that satisfy the congruence condition (n equiv 50 pmod{70}). Through trial and error or graph estimation, we identify the values around the intersections. 4. **Correcting and Finalizing the Solution**: - The initial mention of n=20 and n=21 seems to be a misinterpretation. Given the congruence condition, we should focus on values like n=50 and others that are 70k + 50 for some integer k. - By carefully testing or estimating based on the graph, we find that the correct values of n that satisfy the equation are around two clusters, leading to a total of 6 cases.

To enumerate all possible triangles with perimeter 30, let's consider the possible lengths for the largest side, ranging from 14 down to 10: - **For the largest side of length 14**, the pairs can be (14, 14, 2), (14, 13, 3), (14, 12, 4), (14, 11, 5), (14, 10, 6), (14, 9, 7), totaling 6 variations. - **For the largest side of length 13**, the pairs can be (13, 13, 4), (13, 12, 5), (13, 11, 6), (13, 10, 7), totaling 4 variations. - **For the largest side of length 12**, the pairs can be (12, 12, 6), (12, 11, 7), (12, 10, 8), totaling 3 variations. - **For the largest side of length 11**, the pair can only be (11, 11, 8), totaling 1 variation. - **For an equilateral triangle with side length 10**, this is another unique variation. Now, let's count all variations: text{Total variations} = 6 (14) + 4 (13) + 3 (12) + 1 (11) + 1 (10) = 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 15 However, the longest side being less than 15 means we must also consider the cases where the longest side is 9, resulting in more variations: - **For the largest side of length 9**, the pairs can be (9, 9, 12), (9, 10, 11), totaling 2 variations. Adding these to the previous total gives: text{Final Total} = 15 + 2 = 17 Thus, we can conclude that you can construct 17 different triangles using 30 matchsticks. boxed{17}"},{"prompt":"A ladder of a certain length is leaning against a wall that is perpendicular to level ground.

How long is the ladder?","completion":"Let's denote the length of the ladder as L. When the ladder is leaning against the wall, it forms a right-angled triangle with the wall and the ground. The length of the ladder is the hypotenuse of this triangle, the distance from the wall to the bottom of the ladder is one leg, and the height of the ladder up the wall is the other leg. Initially, the bottom of the ladder is 9 feet from the base of the wall. Let's call the initial height of the ladder up the wall H. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we have: L^2 = 9^2 + H^2 L^2 = 81 + H^2 (Equation 1) When the top of the ladder slips down 1 foot, the height of the ladder up the wall becomes H - 1. The bottom of the ladder slips out to 10.07212046142853 feet from the wall. Again, using the Pythagorean theorem, we have: L^2 = 10.07212046142853^2 + (H - 1)^2 L^2 = 101.446074 + H^2 - 2H + 1 (Equation 2) Since the length of the ladder L does not change, we can set Equation 1 equal to Equation 2: 81 + H^2 = 101.446074 + H^2 - 2H + 1 Now, we can solve for H: 81 = 101.446074 - 2H + 1 2H = 101.446074 + 1 - 81 2H = 21.446074 H = 10.723037 Now that we have the value of H, we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find the length of the ladder: L^2 = 81 + (10.723037)^2 L^2 = 81 + 114.8829 L^2 = 195.8829 Taking the square root of both sides to find L: L = √195.8829 L ≈ 13.9965 feet Therefore, the length of the ladder is approximately boxed{13.9965} feet."},{"prompt":"f the function f(x) = x(xa)^2 has a local minimum at x=2, then a= ___.","completion":"To find the derivative of the function, we get f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4ax + a^2.

For boys: 50% of 50 boys passed the test. 0.50 * 50 = 25 boys passed. For girls: 40% of 100 girls passed the test. 0.40 * 100 = 40 girls passed. Now, let's find out how many boys and girls failed the test. For boys: Since 25 boys passed, the remaining boys failed. 50 boys - 25 boys = 25 boys failed. For girls: Since 40 girls passed, the remaining girls failed. 100 girls - 40 girls = 60 girls failed. Now, let's find the total number of students and the total number of students who failed. Total number of students = number of boys + number of girls Total number of students = 50 + 100 Total number of students = 150 Total number of students who failed = number of boys who failed + number of girls who failed Total number of students who failed = 25 + 60 Total number of students who failed = 85 Now, let's find the percentage of the total who failed.

First Solution: 1. Let ( a = 10^{1/2} ) and ( b = 2 log 11 ). 2. We need to calculate ( a^b ): [ left(10^{1/2}right)^{2 log 11} ] Use the property of exponents ((x^m)^n = x^{mn}): [ = 10^{(1/2) cdot (2 log 11)} ] 3. Simplify the exponent expression: [ 10^{(1/2) cdot 2 log 11} = 10^{log 11} ] 4. Use the property of logarithms ( b^{log_b(x)} = x ): [ 10^{log 11} = 11 ] Therefore, ( a^b = 11 ), which is rational. 5. To verify ( a ) and ( b ) are irrational: - For ( a = 10^{1/2} ): Assume ( 10^{1/2} ) is rational. Then there exist natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( 10^{1/2} = frac{m}{n} ). Squaring both sides gives: [ 10 = left(frac{m}{n}right)^2 rightarrow 10n^2 = m^2 ] This equation implies that ( m^2 ) and ( n^2 ) have different factorizations (involving an odd and even power of 2), which is contradictory. Hence, ( 10^{1/2} ) is irrational. - For ( b = 2 log 11 ): Assume ( log 11 ) is rational. Then there exist natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( log 11 = frac{m}{n} ). Raising 10 to both sides, we get: [ 10^{log 11} = 10^{m/n} rightarrow 11 = 10^{m/n} ] This implies: [ 11^n = 10^m ] Since 11 and 10 have different prime factors, this is impossible. Therefore, ( log 11 ) is irrational, and so is ( 2 log 11 ). Thus, both ( 10^{1/2} ) and ( 2 log 11 ) are irrational and ( a^b = 11 ) is rational. Second Solution: 1. Consider ( A = sqrt{2}^{sqrt{2}} ). 2. If ( A ) is rational, let ( a = sqrt{2} ) and ( b = sqrt{2} ). Clearly, ( sqrt{2} ) is irrational. 3. If ( A ) is irrational, we then consider: [ A^{sqrt{2}} = left(sqrt{2}^{sqrt{2}}right)^{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}^2 = 2 ] Here, ( A = sqrt{2}^{sqrt{2}} ) is irrational, and ( sqrt{2} ) is irrational, but ( left(sqrt{2}^{sqrt{2}}right)^{sqrt{2}} = 2 ) is rational. Therefore, in both cases, we have identified pairs of irrational numbers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a^b ) is rational. # Conclusion [ boxed{text{There exist such irrational numbers.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove that the expression (x^{8} x^{7} y + x^{6} y^{2} ldots x y^{7} + y^{8}) is not a prime number for any natural values of (x) and (y).","completion":"To demonstrate that the given expression ( x^8 - x^7 y + x^6 y^2 - ldots - x y^7 + y^8 ) is never a prime number for any natural numbers ( x ) and ( y ), we proceed as follows: 1. **Expression Construction**: Consider the expression ( x^8 - x^7 y + x^6 y^2 - ldots - x y^7 + y^8 ) and rewrite it more systematically: [ x^8 - x^7 y + x^6 y^2 - ldots - x y^7 + y^8 ] 2. **Factorization Insight**: We observe that the given expression can be rewritten as: [ x^8 - x^7 y + x^6 y^2 - ldots - x y^7 + y^8 = frac{(x+y) left( x^8 - x^7 y + ldots - x y^7 + y^8 right)}{x+y} ] Here, we notice the cyclic pattern that allows us to simplify the fraction by noting symmetry. 3. **Simplified Form**: The simplified form can be expressed by: [ frac{(x + y) (x^8 - x^7 y + x^6 y^2 - ldots - x y^7 + y^8)}{x + y} = frac{x^9 + y^9}{x + y} ] Further simplification provides: [ frac{(x^3 + y^3)left( x^6 - x^3 y^3 + y^6 right)}{x + y} = (x^2 - xy + y^2)(x^6 - x^3 y^3 + y^6) ] 4. **Analyzing Factors**: The factors ( (x^2 - xy + y^2) ) and ( (x^6 - x^3 y^3 + y^6) ): - Notice that ( x^2 - xy + y^2 ) is always positive and equals 1 if and only if ( x = y = 1 ). - However, if ( x neq y ), both ( x^2 - xy + y^2 ) and ( x^6 - x^3 y^3 + y^6 ) are greater than 1. 5. **Prime and Composite Analysis**: Since ( x^2 - xy + y^2 ) and ( x^6 - x^3 y^3 + y^6 ) are both greater than 1 for all natural ( x ) and ( y ) (except ( x = y = 1 )), it means the product of these factors will always be a composite number.

Checking cycles of solutions: 1. ( z^{10} = 1 ) would signify ( z^{10} - 1 = (z^5)^2 - 1 = 0 ), which gives ( z^5 = pm 1 ). That's ( 2 times 6 = 12 ) solutions since ( z^5 ) has 6 fifth roots of unity. 2. ( z^{10} = -1 ) would signify ( z^{10} + 1 = (z^5)^2 + 1 = 0 ), which indicates ( z^5 = pm i ).

The expression is positive if: 1. **Case 1**: ( x < c ) - Since ( a > b > c ) and ( x < c ), we have: [ a - x > 0, quad b - x > 0, quad c - x > 0. ] Hence, the numerator ((a-x)(b-x) > 0 ) and the denominator ((c-x) > 0 ), making the overall expression positive. 2. **Case 2**: ( b < x < a ) - For ( b < x < a ), we have: [ a - x > 0, quad b - x < 0, quad c - x < 0. ] In this case: [ (a-x)(b-x) < 0 quad text{(positive factor times negative factor)} ] and [ (c-x) < 0. ] Therefore, both the numerator and the denominator are negative, making the overall expression positive. II. The expression is negative if: 1. **Case 1**: ( c < x < b ) - For ( c < x < b ), we have: [ a - x > 0, quad b - x > 0, quad c - x < 0. ] Here the numerator ((a-x)(b-x) > 0 ) and the denominator ((c-x) < 0 ), making the overall expression negative. 2. **Case 2**: ( x > a ) - For ( x > a ), we have: [ a - x < 0, quad b - x < 0, quad c - x < 0. ] Hence: [ (a-x)(b-x) > 0 quad text{(negative factor times negative factor)} ] and [ (c-x) < 0. ] Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, making the overall expression negative. III. The expression is zero if: 1. **Case 1**: ( x = a ) - If ( x = a ), then ( a - x = 0 ), which makes the numerator zero. Thus, the entire expression is zero. 2. **Case 2**: ( x = b ) - If ( x = b ), then ( b - x = 0 ), which makes the numerator zero. Thus, the entire expression is zero. IV. The expression is infinite if: - ( x = c ) - If ( x = c ), then the denominator ( c - x = 0 ), leading to division by zero. Thus, the expression tends to infinity. # Conclusion: The values of ( x ) determine the sign and behavior of the expression ((a-x)(b-x):(c-x)) as follows: - **Positive**: ( x < c ) or ( b < x < a ) - **Negative**: ( c < x < b ) or ( x > a ) - **Zero**: ( x = a ) or ( x = b ) - **Infinity**: ( x = c ) [ boxed{Positive: x < c , text{or} , b < x < a, quad Negative: c < x < b , text{or} , x > a, quad Zero: x = a , text{or} , x = b, quad Infinity: x = c} ]"},{"prompt":"An adult panda can eat 138 pounds of bamboo each day.

However, since the question does not specify that the ratio needs to be simplified, we can leave it as a fraction: Ratio of women to total population = 377050 / 754100 This is the ratio of women to the total population in Salem. If you want to express it as a decimal or percentage, you can perform the division: Ratio as a decimal = 377050 / 754100 ≈ 0.5 Ratio as a percentage = 0.5 * 100% = 50% So, the ratio of women to the total population in Salem is boxed{377050:754100,} which is approximately 0.5 or 50%."},{"prompt":"Factorize the expression x^{3}+5x in the complex number range.","completion":"To factorize the expression x^{3}+5x within the complex number range, follow these steps: 1. First, factor out the common factor x from the given expression: [x^{3}+5x = x(x^{2}+5)] 2. Next, recognize that x^{2}+5 can be factored further into the product of two complex factors. This is because x^{2}+5 can be seen as a sum of squares, which can be factored using the formula a^2 + b^2 = (a-bi)(a+bi) where a=x and b=sqrt{5}: [x(x^{2}+5) = x(x^{2}+5 cdot 1) = x(x^{2} + (sqrt{5})^2)] 3.

The square root of 15 is approximately 3.87, and the square root of 121 is exactly 11. Therefore, the integers ( n ) must satisfy ( 3.87 < |n| < 11 ). Since ( n ) must be an integer, the possible values for ( n ) are from 4 to 10 and their negatives. 2. **List all possible integers**: Positive integers within the range are ( 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ). Negative integers within the range are ( -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10 ). 3. **Count the integers**: There are 7 positive integers and 7 negative integers.

For (x > -7), (x + 7 > 0), and for (x < -7), (x + 7 < 0). 3. **Combine and Solve**: Since the denominator is always positive, the sign of the fraction (frac{x + 7}{x^2 + 2x + 8}) is determined by the numerator (x + 7).

Let's denote the squares in the corners according to their coordinates: - Top-left corner: ((1,1)) - Top-right corner: ((1,8)) - Bottom-left corner: ((8,1)) - Bottom-right corner: ((8,8)) Since opposite corners are removed, we can consider the removal of ((1,1)) and ((8,8)). Both these squares are colored black on a standard chessboard. 3. **Counting the Remaining Squares**: Originally, an (8 times 8) chessboard has (64) squares. - Number of black squares: (32) - Number of white squares: (32) By removing the two black corner squares, we have: - Remaining black squares: (32 - 2 = 30) - Remaining white squares: (32) 4. **Domino Coverage**: Each domino covers exactly two squares: one black and one white. Thus, to tile the modified chessboard completely with (1 times 2) dominoes, we need an equal number of black and white squares. 5. **Analysis and Conclusion**: After the removal, we have (30) black squares and (32) white squares, an imbalance between the number of black and white squares. Since each domino requires one black and one white square, it is impossible to place dominos in such a way that they cover the chessboard without leaving some squares uncovered or overlapping.

Assume the circumcenter O of triangle ABC is the origin of the complex plane and the circumcircle of triangle ABC is the unit circle. Let the complex numbers corresponding to the vertices A, B, C be a, b, c respectively. By definition, O is the origin, so |a|=|b|=|c|=1. 2. **Defining the Points:** The points M, Q, N, P are on AB, AC, BC, and BC, respectively, such that AM = MQ = QP = PN = NM.

We need to demonstrate that there exist infinitely many pairs of integers k, m in mathbb{Z} such that the triples x, y, z in mathbb{Z} meet the condition (x, y) = 1. Observe that if all numbers k, m, a, b are pairwise coprime (mutually prime) and at least one of a or b does not divide by 3, then x and y will be coprime. 4.

This implies that its base is a quadrilateral (a shape with 4 sides). - A quadrilateral prism has two bases, and each base contributes the same number of edges as the number of sides in the base shape. Therefore, the number of edges contributed by the bases is 4 times 2 = 8. - Additionally, each lateral face contributes one edge that is not shared with the base. Since there are 4 lateral faces, this adds 4 more edges. - Combining the edges from the bases and the lateral faces, we have a total of 8 + 4 = 12 edges. For the vertices: - Each vertex on the base is replicated on the top base, meaning the number of vertices is twice the number of vertices on one base. - Since the base is a quadrilateral, it has 4 vertices. Thus, the total number of vertices in the prism is 4 times 2 = 8. Therefore, a prism with 4 lateral faces has boxed{12} edges and boxed{8} vertices."},{"prompt":"Every year an amount increases by a certain fraction of itself.

The total cost of the apples is 40A cents, and the total cost of the oranges is 60O cents. Mary puts back 6 oranges, so she keeps O - 6 oranges. The average price of the fruit she keeps is 45¢. Since she keeps A apples and O - 6 oranges, the total cost of the fruit she keeps is 40A + 60(O - 6) cents. The average price of the fruit she keeps is the total cost divided by the number of pieces she keeps, which is A + (O - 6). So we have: (40A + 60(O - 6)) / (A + O - 6) = 45 Now let's solve for A and O. We know that A + O = 10, so we can express O in terms of A: O = 10 - A. Substituting O with 10 - A in the equation above, we get: (40A + 60((10 - A) - 6)) / (A + (10 - A) - 6) = 45 Simplifying the equation: (40A + 60(4 - A)) / (10 - 6) = 45 (40A + 240 - 60A) / 4 = 45 -20A + 240 = 180 -20A = -60 A = 3 Since A + O = 10, and A = 3, then O = 10 - 3 = 7.

Thus, we examine numbers less than or equal to 108. Step 2: Simplify the problem using divisibility A number n that is 4 times the sum of its digits must be divisible by 4.

We consider two cases: ① If the slope of line l does not exist, i.e., l: x=-1, substituting it into the circle's equation yields y=±4, so |AB|=8, which is valid. ② If the slope of line l exists, let the equation of line l be y-frac {3}{2}=k(x+1), i.e., 2kx-2y+3+2k=0. Since AB=8, the distance d from the center C to line l is d=sqrt {25-16}=3. Thus, we have d=frac{|4k-0+3+2k|}{sqrt{4+4k^2}}=3. Solving for k, we get k=frac{3}{4}. Therefore, the equation of line l is y-frac{3}{2}=frac{3}{4}(x+1), which simplifies to 3x-4y+9=0. (2) Proof: Since P is a point on the line x+y+6=0, let P be (m, -m-6).

Substituting tan A = 2tan B into the equation and simplifying gives 2tan^2 B - 4tan B - 1 = 0, Solving this, we get tan B = frac{2 pm sqrt{6}}{2}, Since B is an acute angle, therefore tan B = frac{2 + sqrt{6}}{2}, therefore tan A = 2tan B = 2 + sqrt{6}.

Consider each pair of intersecting circles a and b. They intersect at two points, dividing the boundary into arcs. For a maximum, these arcs should form non-overlapping sides. 4. **Establishing the Maximum Number**: For each circle, every intersection adds two points on the boundary of that circle. If we consider two intersections, it results in dividing the circle into four segments. By generalizing for n circles: - Each circle can intersect with every other circle at two points. Hence, a single circle contributes a maximum of 2(n-1) intersections. - These intersections form segments between the circles. When counting distinct segments, each circle intersection point with another adds to the count without overlapping the previous ones. 5. **Induction Basis (n=2)**: For n=2, there are exactly 2 curved sides, located between the intersection points of the two circles. 6. **Inductive Step**: Assume for k circles, the maximum number of curved sides is 2k-2. When adding another circle, it can intersect each of the k existing circles at two new points, thus adding 2k new segments. However, this doesn't exceed the previous rule because these segments are counted within existing boundaries. 7. **Conclusion**: Using this principle inductively, the maximum number of curved sides for n circles is: [ 2(n-1) = 2n-2 ] Thus, the maximum number of curved sides that the figure F can have when formed by the intersection of n circles is: [ boxed{2n-2} ]"},{"prompt":"Chris has been saving his allowance to buy a new pair of soccer cleats and a ball.

Each secant can optimally divide each sector once, resulting in each secant adding three new areas. This leads to 3 + 3 times 2 = 9 areas. 2. **General Case Analysis**: - Each additional n introduces 3 more radii, increasing the previous number of areas. Each secant will ideally intersect each new sector created by the radii, thus multiplying the division. - The secant lines, placed optimally, should intersect every sector exactly once. Thus, each additional sector created by a new radius is doubled in area by each secant. 3. **Pattern Recognition and Formula Derivation**: - From the pattern, the initial circle with two secant lines gives 4 areas.

This gives us: [1^{2} = 2p(1) implies 2p = 1 implies p = frac{1}{2}.] Therefore, the equation of the parabola becomes x^{2} = y. The directrix of a parabola x^{2} = 2py is y = -frac{p}{2}, so in this case, the directrix is y = -frac{1}{4}. This shows that option A is incorrect because it states the directrix is y = -1.

For each segment (A_p A_q), assign to it the smaller of the two numbers: (|p-q|) and (2n - |p-q|). This is because the polygon is periodic with modulus (2n), and we consider the shortest distance between the vertices in a circular manner. 2. As a result, for the (n) pairs of vertices, we will get the numbers (1, 2, ldots, n). Note that these are the possible lengths of the segments when assigned the shorter distance. 3. Now, let's count the even and odd numbers among these segment lengths. We need to determine the counts of even and odd numbers between 1 and (n). 4. If (n = 4m + 2), which is of the form described in the problem: - Then (n) is an even number and can be written as (n = 4m + 2), where (m) is an integer. - Among the numbers (1, 2, ldots, n), half are even and half are odd because every two consecutive integers contain one even and one odd number. - Thus, there are exactly (2m + 1) even numbers and (2m + 1) odd numbers. 5. If (n = 4m + 3), which is another form described in the problem: - Then (n) is an odd number and can be written as (n = 4m + 3), where (m) is an integer. - Similarly, among the numbers (1, 2, ldots, n), half are even and half are odd, but the odd numbers will be one more than the even numbers since (n) itself is odd. - Thus, there are exactly (2m + 1) even numbers and (2m + 2) odd numbers. 6. Considering odd edges: - Odd segments correspond to (A_p A_q) where (p) and (q) have different parities (one is even, the other is odd). - Therefore, we can place odd values (|p - q|) or (|2n - (p - q)|) into segments connecting an even index and an odd index. 7. Even edges: - Even segments correspond to (A_p A_q) where (p) and (q) share the same parity (both are even or both are odd). - This is due to the fact that these segments represent the remaining vertex pairs. 8. Calculating the number of vertices connected by even-length segments: - If among the remaining (n) segments, we find all the odd segments account for connecting even and odd vertices. - Therefore, even segments connect the remaining vertices which must always connect vertices of the same parity (either both even or both odd). 9. Concluding observations: - Since both (2m + 1) (from (n = 4m + 2)) and (2m + 2 - k) (remaining odd) add up to a count involving segments connecting vertices of the same parity. - This (2m + 1) even numbers create at least two segments of the same length between even or odd-solitary numbers. - Result conflicts with the assumption that all segments were distinct. Thus, two pairs of vertices must be endpoints of equal segments if (n = 4m + 2) or (n = 4m + 3). [ blacksquare ]"},{"prompt":"A hiker traverses a certain path at a constant speed.

Note that Petya can always eat exactly 1 candy by taking the only candy from the pile with 1 candy on his first move. 2. To prove that Vasya can prevent Petya from eating more than 1 candy, let's examine Vasya's optimal strategy: - Whenever a pile with exactly 1 candy appears, Vasya takes that candy and eats it. - If there are no such piles, Vasya takes 1 candy from any pile that has more than 2 candies. 3. First, let's see why Vasya will always have a move: - Suppose at some point Vasya has no valid move that follows the strategy, meaning that each pile has at most 2 candies and no piles with exactly 1 candy exist. - In this situation, each pile must have exactly 2 candies, and the total number of candies remaining is even. - Initially, the total number of candies is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 55 = frac{55 cdot 56}{2} = 1540 ] which is even. Therefore, after an odd number of moves (which is Petya's move), an odd number of candies remains, contradicting the above situation that only an even number of candies remains after Vasya's move. 4. Thus, it's guaranteed that Vasya can always find a move. 5. Now let's analyze why Petya cannot eat more than 1 candy: - If Petya starts by eating the only candy from a pile with 1 candy, he eats 1 candy directly. - If Petya does not take any pile with 1 candy, Vasya will take it on his next move, ensuring Petya does not benefit from any future moves concerning that specific candy. - Once Vasya follows this strategy, each time a pile with 1 candy appears, it is eaten by Vasya almost immediately. - As a result, all piles Petya creates from piles with more than 1 or 2 candies will be eliminated by Vasya's strategy, ensuring no new piles with 1 candy consistently stay for Petya to eat in future rounds. 6.

If we call the middle sibling's age \\"n\\", then the ages of the siblings can be represented as: n - 4, n - 2, n, n + 2, n + 4 Since these are consecutive odd integers, the difference between each age is 2. The sum of their ages is given as 325, so we can write the equation: (n - 4) + (n - 2) + n + (n + 2) + (n + 4) = 325 Combining like terms, we get: 5n = 325 Dividing both sides by 5, we find: n = 325 / 5 n = 65 So the middle sibling is 65 years old.

To determine whether roots exist, the discriminant of the quadratic must be non-negative. 2. Let's calculate the discriminant D. For a quadratic ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is given by: [ D = b^2 - 4ac ] Here, a = 1, b = -2sin(x y), and c = 1. Therefore, the discriminant is: [ D = (-2sin(x y))^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1 = 4 sin^2(x y) - 4 ] 3. For the quadratic to have real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative: [ D geq 0 implies 4 sin^2(x y) - 4 geq 0 implies sin^2(x y) geq 1 ] 4. The solution to sin^2(x y) = 1 is: [ sin(x y) = pm 1 ] Therefore, we have: [ sin(x y) = 1 quad text{or} quad sin(x y) = -1 ] 5.

The solutions for x based on even and odd n are: [ frac{pi}{2} + pi n = x y Rightarrow y = frac{frac{pi}{2} + pi n}{x} ] - For even n: [ x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0 implies (x-1)^2 = 0 implies x = 1 ] - For odd n: [ x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0 implies (x+1)^2 = 0 implies x = -1 ] 7. Since the equation is symmetric in x, the corresponding y values remain the same for x = 1 and x = -1: [ (x, y) = left( pm 1, frac{pi}{2} + pi k right), quad k in mathbb{Z} ] 8. We now need to determine how many of these solutions fall within the circle x^2 + y^2 leq 100. For pm 1: [ 1 + y^2 leq 100 implies y^2 leq 99 implies |y| leq sqrt{99} ] With y = frac{pi}{2} + pi k, we solve for k: [ -sqrt{99} leq frac{pi}{2} + pi k leq sqrt{99} ] [ -sqrt{99} - frac{pi}{2} leq pi k leq sqrt{99} - frac{pi}{2} ] [ -frac{sqrt{99}}{pi} - frac{1}{2} leq k leq frac{sqrt{99}}{pi} - frac{1}{2} ] Numerically, k values satisfying this are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 giving 6 total solutions. 9.

At your usual speed: [ S cdot T = text{Distance to the bus stop} ] At the slower speed: [ frac{3}{5}S cdot T' = text{Distance to the bus stop} ] Since the distance to the bus stop doesn't change, we can set the two equations equal to each other: [ S cdot T = frac{3}{5}S cdot T' ] Now, we can solve for ( T' ) in terms of ( T ): [ T' = frac{5}{3}T ] You miss the bus by 5 minutes, which means ( T' = T + 5 ) minutes.

Denote x_i as the number of diagonals at point A_i in A_3A_4 ldots A_n. 5. **Sum of Diagonals:** - It is obvious that sum x_i is divisible by 2 because each vertex must have an even number of diagonals. - However, x_n is odd because A_nA_3 is a diagonal, leading to a contradiction since sum x_i must be even. 6. **Considering Sub-polygons:** - If A_k neq A_n, then A_1 must be connected to A_k. Consider two polygons P = A_3A_4 ldots A_k and Q = A_{k+1} ldots A_1. - If the number of diagonals starting at A_k to P is even, and so is Q, then both P and Q satisfy the condition. Thus, the number of vertices of P and Q must be divisible by 3. - If the number of diagonals starting at A_k to P is odd, we get a contradiction similar to the first case. 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, n must be divisible by 3.

According to the problem, l_1, l_2, and l_3 intersect pairwise (meaning each point A, B, C belongs to two of these lines). First, it's clear that the case where a = 0 is impossible, otherwise the lines y = ax + 4 and y = frac{a}{2}x + 8 would be parallel. 3. The point C lies on the Oy axis and on two of the three lines. This means their equations, when substituting x = 0, give the same values (equal to the ordinate of point C). Consequently, C cannot be the intersection point of l_1 and l_3. 4. The line l_1 intersects the Oy axis at -frac{4}{a}, the line l_2 at -frac{b}{2}, and the line l_3 at frac{-16}{a}. Among these three numbers, there are two equal ones (equal to the abscissa of point B). Clearly, -frac{4}{a} neq frac{-16}{a}, meaning two cases are possible. **Case 1:** -frac{4}{a} = -frac{b}{2}. This means l_1 and l_2 intersect at point B. 5. Since -frac{4}{a} = -frac{b}{2}, we have: [ -frac{4}{a} = -frac{b}{2} implies frac{4}{a} = frac{b}{2} implies b = frac{8}{a} ] 6. Point C is the intersection of lines l_2 and l_3, so their equations when x = 0 coincide, giving b = 8. Hence: [ frac{8}{a} = 8 implies a = 1 ] 7.

Point C is the intersection of lines l_1 and l_2, so their equations when x = 0 must coincide, implying b = 4. Hence: [ frac{32}{a} = 4 implies a = 8 ] 12.

Thus, statement A is boxed{text{correct}}. **Statement B**: If sin A > sin B, then A > B - In a triangle, larger angles have larger opposite sides. - By the Law of Sines, frac{a}{sin A}=frac{b}{sin B}. - If sin A > sin B, it implies a > b, which in turn implies A > B due to the property of triangles that larger sides are opposite larger angles.

He has four bottles of orange soda and seven bottles of grape soda, each containing 2 liters. So, Julio's total amount of orange soda is 4 bottles * 2 liters/bottle = 8 liters. Julio's total amount of grape soda is 7 bottles * 2 liters/bottle = 14 liters. Therefore, Julio's total amount of soda is 8 liters (orange) + 14 liters (grape) = 22 liters. Now, let's consider Mateo's soda. We know that Mateo has one bottle of orange soda and an unknown number of bottles of grape soda. We also know that Julio has 14 more liters of soda than Mateo. Let's denote the number of bottles of grape soda Mateo has as G. Mateo's total amount of orange soda is 1 bottle * 2 liters/bottle = 2 liters. Mateo's total amount of grape soda is G bottles * 2 liters/bottle = 2G liters. Therefore, Mateo's total amount of soda is 2 liters (orange) + 2G liters (grape).

According to the definition of a derivative, if f'(x) exists, it represents the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at point x. 2. If f'(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, it means the function f(x) is non-decreasing, but not necessarily strictly increasing.

Noting that (n+k) binom{2n}{n-k} = 2n binom{2n-1}{n-k} , so, mathrm{E}(xi+n) = n binom{2n}{n} frac{1}{2^{2n}} + frac{2n}{2^{2n-1}} left( sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{2n-1}{n-1-k} right) 3. The sum inside the parentheses is half of all the terms in the (2n-1)^{th} row of Pascal's Triangle: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{2n-1}{k} = 2^{2n-2} 4. Therefore, mathrm{E}(xi+n) = n C_{2n}^{n} frac{1}{2^{2n}} + n 5. Finally, removing n to get mathrm{E}(xi): mathrm{E}(xi) = mathrm{E}(xi+n) - n = n binom{2n}{n} frac{1}{2^{2n}} Approximating this using Stirling's formula m! approx sqrt{2 pi m} cdot m^m e^{-m}: begin{aligned} mathrm{E}(xi) &approx frac{n}{2^{2n}} cdot frac{sqrt{4 pi n} cdot (2n)^{2n} e^{-2n}}{left( sqrt{2 pi n} cdot n^n e^{-n} right)^2} = sqrt{frac{n}{pi}} end{aligned} Conclusion: boxed{sqrt{frac{n}{pi}} approx 0.564 sqrt{n}} Part (c): Calculating the variance: 1.

Using that k^2 = (2n-k-n)^2 and then substitute, mathrm{E}(xi^2) = sum_{k=0}^{2n} (k-n)^2 C_{2n}^{k} frac{1}{2^{2n}} Given that xi follows a binomial distribution with n trials and success probability p=0.5, the variance mathrm{Var}(xi) equals np(1-p) = n/2. 3. Thus, mathrm{D}(xi) = mathrm{E}(xi^2) - (mathrm{E}(xi))^2 mathrm{D}(xi) = frac{n}{2} - left(frac{n binom{2n}{n}}{2^{2n}}right)^2 approx frac{n}{2} - frac{n}{pi} mathrm{D}(xi) approx frac{pi-2}{2pi} n approx 0.182 n Conclusion: boxed{0.182 n}"},{"prompt":"Given the universal set U = [0, 2] and the set M = {x mid x^2 x leq 0}, find the complement of M with respect to U, denoted as complement_U M.","completion":"First, we need to determine the elements that belong to the set M. The inequality x^2 - x leq 0 can be factored as x(x - 1) leq 0. This inequality holds true in two situations: When x=0 or when 0<x<1. So we can write the set M as M = {x mid 0 leq x leq 1}. Now, the complement complement_U M includes all elements in the universal set U that are not in M. Since U = [0, 2] and M = [0, 1], the set complement_U M will be composed of all real numbers between 1 (excluding 1) and 2 (including 2).

First, let's express the perimeter of the rectangle in terms of x. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(text{length} + text{width}). Since the total length of the rope is 10cm, which forms the perimeter of the rectangle, we have: [2(x + text{width}) = 10] Solving for the width, we get: [text{width} = frac{10}{2} - x = 5 - x] Therefore, the area of the rectangle, y, which is the product of its length and width, can be expressed as: [y = x times (text{width}) = x times (5 - x)] Simplifying this expression gives us: [y = 5x - x^2] Rearranging the terms to match the standard form of a quadratic equation, we get: [y = -x^2 + 5x] Next, to determine the range of x, we consider the constraints. Since x represents the length of one side of the rectangle, and the width is (5 - x), both x and (5 - x) must be greater than 0 for the rectangle to exist. This gives us two inequalities: [x > 0] [5 - x > 0 Rightarrow x < 5] Combining these inequalities gives us the range of x: [0 < x < 5] Therefore, the algebraic expression for y in terms of x is y = -x^2 + 5x, and the range of the independent variable x is 0 < x < 5. Encapsulating the final answer: [y = -x^2 + 5x, quad 0 < x < 5] Thus, the algebraic expression for y is boxed{y = -x^2 + 5x}, and the range of x is boxed{0 < x < 5}."},{"prompt":"A certain telephone company offers two plans, A and B.

The duration of a call, in minutes, for which the company charges the same amount under plan A and under plan B is 18 minutes. What is the total charge for the first 4 minutes under plan A?","completion":"Let's denote the total charge for the first 4 minutes under plan A as X. Under plan A, the cost of an 18-minute call would be the cost of the first 4 minutes (X) plus the cost of the remaining 14 minutes at 0.06 per minute. So the equation for plan A would be: [ X + 14 times 0.06 ] Under plan B, the cost of an 18-minute call is 0.08 per minute for the entire duration. So the equation for plan B would be: [ 18 times 0.08 ] Since the cost is the same for an 18-minute call under both plans, we can set these two equations equal to each other: [ X + 14 times 0.06 = 18 times 0.08 ] Now we can solve for X: [ X + 0.84 = 1.44 ] [ X = 1.44 - 0.84 ] [ X = 0.60 ] Therefore, the total charge for the first 4 minutes under plan A is boxed{0.60} ."},{"prompt":"Let A be a commutative unitary ring with an odd number of elements. Prove that the number of solutions of the equation x^2 equal{} x (in A ) divides the number of invertible elements of A .","completion":"1. **Characteristic of the Ring:** Since ( A ) is a commutative unitary ring with an odd number of elements, the characteristic of ( A ) must be odd. This implies that 2 is invertible in ( A ). 2. **Equation Transformation:** Consider the equation ( x^2 = x ). We can rewrite this equation as: [ x^2 - x = 0 implies x(x - 1) = 0 ] This equation implies that ( x ) is either 0 or 1 in the ring ( A ). 3. **Invertibility of 4:** Since the characteristic of ( A ) is odd, 4 is invertible in ( A ). This allows us to transform the equation ( x^2 = x ) into another form. Specifically, we can write: [ x^2 = x implies (2x - 1)^2 = 1 ] This transformation is valid because 2 is invertible in ( A ). 4. **Square Roots of 1:** The equation ( (2x - 1)^2 = 1 ) implies that ( 2x - 1 ) is a square root of 1. Therefore, ( 2x - 1 ) must be either 1 or -1. Solving these equations: [ 2x - 1 = 1 implies 2x = 2 implies x = 1 ] [ 2x - 1 = -1 implies 2x = 0 implies x = 0 ] Thus, the solutions to ( x^2 = x ) are ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 1 ). 5. **Number of Solutions:** The number of solutions to ( x^2 = x ) is the number of elements ( x ) in ( A ) such that ( x(x - 1) = 0 ). This is equivalent to finding the number of idempotent elements in ( A ). In this case, we have identified that the solutions are ( x = 0 ) and ( x = 1 ). 6. **Invertible Elements and Subgroup:** The set of solutions to ( x^2 = x ) forms a subgroup of the unit group ( U ) of the ring ( A ). The unit group ( U ) consists of all invertible elements in ( A ). Since the solutions to ( x^2 = x ) are contained in ( U ), and the set of solutions forms a subgroup, the number of solutions must divide the number of invertible elements in ( A ). 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the number of solutions to the equation ( x^2 = x ) divides the number of invertible elements in ( A ).

Since |x| can be either x or -x depending on the value of x, we have two cases to consider: - **Case 1:** x geq 0 In this case, |x| = x, so our inequality becomes -x^2 + x + m + 2 geq x. Simplifying, we get: -x^2 + m + 2 geq 0 - **Case 2:** x < 0 In this case, |x| = -x, so our inequality becomes -x^2 + x + m + 2 geq -x. Simplifying, we get: -x^2 + 2x + m + 2 geq 0 2. **Solve for x in Both Cases** - **Case 1:** -x^2 + m + 2 geq 0 This is a quadratic inequality. The roots of the corresponding equation -x^2 + m + 2 = 0 are given by: x = pmsqrt{m + 2} Since we're considering x geq 0, we only take the positive root. The inequality holds for x in [0, sqrt{m + 2}]. - **Case 2:** -x^2 + 2x + m + 2 geq 0 The roots of the corresponding equation -x^2 + 2x + m + 2 = 0 are: x = 1 pm sqrt{m + 3} Since we're considering x < 0, we focus on the root x = 1 - sqrt{m + 3}. The inequality holds for x in [1 - sqrt{m + 3}, 1]. 3. **Determine the Range of m** For the solution set of the inequality f(x) geq |x| to contain exactly one integer, the intervals derived from both cases must overlap at exactly one integer point. This condition is satisfied when the upper bound of the interval from Case 1 is just to the right of an integer, and the lower bound of the interval from Case 2 is just to the left of the same integer. This integer is 0, as it's the only point where the two cases can meet given the nature of |x|. Therefore, we need m + 2 to be slightly greater than 0^2 = 0 and m + 3 to be slightly less than 1^2 = 1. This gives us: 0 < m + 2 < 1 Simplifying, we find: -2 < m < -1 Thus, the range of real number m for which the solution set of the inequality f(x) geq |x| contains exactly one integer is boxed{[-2, -1)}."},{"prompt":"The integer part of the quotient of 3.24÷1.5 is ; the integer part of the quotient of 1.92÷2.4 is .","completion":"**Analysis:** According to the principle that the quotient remains unchanged, we transform 3.24÷1.5 into 32.4÷15.

This is because the centroid, being the balance point, does not move under reflection about a symmetry line. 4. **Implication of Multiple Symmetries**: If the polygon has multiple axes of symmetry, all reflections corresponding to these axes must map the centroid to the same point (since a point cannot map to two different locations under symmetry).

According to the problem, any group of 10 parrots must contain at least one red parrot. This implies that the number of parrots that are not red must be at most 9. Therefore, we can write the inequality: [ y + z leq 9 ] 3. Similarly, the problem states that any group of 12 parrots must contain at least one yellow parrot. This means that the number of parrots that are not yellow must be at most 11. Consequently, we have: [ x + z leq 11 ] 4. To find an upper bound for the total number of parrots, we sum the individual constraints: [ (y + z) + (x + z) leq 9 + 11 ] Simplifying the above inequality, we get: [ x + y + 2z leq 20 ] 5. Rearranging to find an upper bound for ( x + y + z ), we recognize: [ x + y + z leq 20 - z leq 19 ] This shows that the total number of parrots does not exceed 19. 6. Now, we need to verify if it is possible to have exactly 19 parrots under the given conditions. Suppose there are 10 red parrots, 8 yellow parrots, and 1 green parrot. The total is: [ x + y + z = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 ] 7. We check the conditions: - Any 10 parrots always include a red parrot since there are 10 red parrots. - Any 12 parrots always include a yellow parrot since there are 8 yellow parrots. Hence, having 19 parrots satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the largest number of parrots that can be in the zoo is: [ boxed{19} ]"},{"prompt":"The ratio of buses to cars on River Road is some ratio.

We solve for p in terms of q: [ 5p = 50 - 4q ] [ p = 10 - frac{4q}{5} ] Since p must be a whole number, frac{4q}{5} must also be a whole number. This means q must be a multiple of 5. Let's check possible values of q starting from the smallest: 1. If q = 5, then p = 10 - frac{4 times 5}{5} = 10 - 4 = 6. Thus, p + q = 6 + 5 = 11. 2. If q = 10, then p = 10 - frac{4 times 10}{5} = 10 - 8 = 2. Thus, p + q = 2 + 10 = 12. Trying q = 0 (since q must increase in steps of 5): [ p = 10 - frac{4 times 0}{5} = 10 ] So, p + q = 10 + 0 = 10.

Consider a point ( C' ) such that ( C' ) is the reflection of point ( C ) across the line ( AD ). Therefore, ( AD ) is the perpendicular bisector of segment ( CC' ). 3. Since ( C' ) is the reflection of ( C ), triangle ( ACD ) is congruent to triangle ( ADC' ). Therefore, quadrilateral ( AC DC' ) forms a rhombus because all sides are equal and opposite angles are equal. Specifically, ( AC = AD = DC = DC' ). 4. In the rhombus ( AC DC' ), the angles at ( A ) and ( D ) are bisected by the diagonals. Therefore, ( angle A C' D = 2alpha ). Consequently, this implies ( angle A + angle C' = 180^circ ) since consecutive angles in a rhombus add up to ( 180^circ ). 5. Observing quadrilateral ( ABDC' ), the combination of angle relationships ( angle ABD + 2alpha = 180^circ ) implies that quadrilateral ( ABDC' ) is cyclic. This is because opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to ( 180^circ ). 6.

To solve this problem, let's follow these steps: 1. Let (f(ABCD)) denote the sum of the four angles in the given problem. Step 1: Consider the special case when quadrilateral (ABCD) can be inscribed in a circle. In this case, if (ABCD) is cyclic, the opposite angles of the quadrilateral add up to (180^circ). Therefore, we can decompose: [ f(ABCD) = (angle BAC + angle CAD) + (angle DCA + angle BCD) = angle BAD + angle BCD = 180^circ. ] So the required assertion holds true for a cyclic quadrilateral. Step 2: Consider the case when (ABCD) is not inscribed in a circle (general convex quadrilateral). The described condition implies that the circumcircle of (triangle BCD) intersects the line segment (AC) again at a point (A' neq A). Here, let’s denote the angle sum differently for the new quadrilateral (A'BCD): [ f(A'BCD) ] We need to demonstrate the substitution and angle sums difference: [ f(A'BCD) - f(ABCD) = (angle BA'C - angle BAC) + (angle AD'B - angle ADB) = pm(angle ABA' - angle ADA'). ] Note that the sign depends on the specific alignment of the points (A), (A') on line (AC). Step 3: Utilizing the given products and the sine rule. From the given condition: [ frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AD}{DC} = k ] We denote (R) as the circumradius of (triangle A'BCD). Using the sine rule: [ 2R = frac{BC}{sin BA'C} = frac{CD}{sin CA'D}. ] Multiplying both sides by (k): [ frac{AB}{sin AA'B} = frac{AD}{sin AA'D}. ] Using the sine rule in triangles (ABA') and (ADA'): [ frac{AA'}{sin ABA'} = frac{AB}{sin AA'B} = frac{AD}{sin AA'D} = frac{AA'}{sin ADA'}. ] Thus: [ sin ABA' = sin ADA' ] That implies: [ angle ABA' = angle ADA' quad text{(or if angles' sum is (180^circ))} ] Since the sum of angles for a non-convex quadrilateral is (360^circ): [ angle ABA' + angle ADA' < 180^circ. ] Thus, (angle ABA' = angle ADA').

This is given by the combination formula: [ binom{100}{2} = frac{100 cdot 99}{2} = 4950 ] 3. **Understanding the Meeting Conditions:** Each evening, 3 people are on duty, so we are forming 1 pair each of the 3 people: [ {a, b, c} implies {(a,b), (a,c), (b,c)} ] Thus, every evening 3 pairs are formed. 4. **Counting the Number of Evenings:** Suppose there are ( N ) evenings, then the number of pairs formed in ( N ) evenings can be written as: [ 3N = 4950 ] 5. **Solving for ( N ):** Solving for ( N ) gives: [ N = frac{4950}{3} = 1650 ] 6. **Counting Individual Appearances:** Each person appears on duty with 2 other people. Hence, if we assume that every arrangement allows every pair to meet exactly once, every person should be on duty multiple times. Let ( k ) be the number of times any given person is on duty: [ 3k = 1650 implies k = frac{1650}{100} = 16.5 ] 7. **Analyzing the Number of Pairs per Person:** If each person is on duty ( k ) times, then each of these duties involves 2 other people, contributing 2 pairs each time. Since each pair must meet exactly once, the number of pairs involving a single person must be: [ k cdot 2 = 16.5 cdot 2 = 33 ] 8. **Checking Consistency:** The problem arises because 33 is not an even number, and it means each person would be counted in 33 pairs. In reality, because each pair should meet exactly once, the number of pairs involving any particular person should also be even (as the total number pairs formed must balance for each individual). Therefore, it is impossible to satisfy these conditions. # Conclusion: Thus, with 100 people, it is impossible to arrange duty schedules so that every pair meets exactly once.

Since we're removing the same percentage of salt as the solution, we're also removing ( 70 times 0.18 = 12.6 ) gallons of salt. So, after removing 70 gallons, we have ( 45 - 12.6 = 32.4 ) gallons of salt left in 180 gallons of solution (since ( 250 - 70 = 180 )). Now we add 70 gallons of the second solution, which is ( 0.92x ) gallons of salt (since 8% is water, so 92% is salt). The total amount of salt in the new 250-gallon mixture is ( 32.4 + 0.92x times 70 ). The new solution is 22% salt by weight, so in 250 gallons, there are ( 250 times 0.22 = 55 ) gallons of salt.

However, assuming that we are looking for the angle between the given line and another line within the plane that yields the maximum angle (which will be a straight line or 180 degrees as any greater angle would again refer to an overlap on the same line), we can interpret the question as: \\"The minimum angle formed by a line and a plane is the angle between the line and its perpendicular projection onto the plane.

This equation represents a linear function where the slope is -3. The slope of a line, denoted as k in some contexts, tells us how the value of y changes as x changes. In this case, since k = -3 < 0, it indicates that the line is decreasing. This means that as x increases, y decreases. Given two points on this line, left(-2,mright) and left(3,nright), we want to compare the values of m and n. Since the slope of the line is negative, we know that as we move from left to right along the x-axis (from a smaller x value to a larger x value), the corresponding y values will decrease. Specifically, we have two x values: -2 and 3. Since -2 < 3, we are moving from left to right on the x-axis when going from the point left(-2,mright) to the point left(3,nright).

(1) Let the probability of an employee being eliminated be (f(p)). Find (f(frac{1}{2})). (2) The cost for each employee who does not need to be retested is 120, and the total cost for those who need to be retested is 200. In addition to the testing costs, other costs amount to 10,000 in total. All 300 employees participate in the tests, and the budget is 60,000. Will this plan exceed the budget? Please explain.","completion":"# Solution: Part (1): Given the problem, we can calculate the probability of an employee being eliminated as follows: - The probability of being eliminated after the first round of tests is due to failing two or all three tests. This can be calculated as: [ f_1(p) = C_3^2{p^2}(1-p) + C_3^3{p^3} ] where (C_3^2) and (C_3^3) are the combinations for choosing 2 out of 3 and 3 out of 3, respectively. - The probability of being eliminated after the retest (failing one test initially and then failing one or both retests) is: [ f_2(p) = C_3^1p(1-p)^2[1-(1-p)^2] ] where (C_3^1) is the combination for choosing 1 out of 3. Combining these, the overall probability of an employee being eliminated is: [ f(p) = f_1(p) + f_2(p) = C_3^2{p^2}(1-p) + C_3^3{p^3} + C_3^1p(1-p)^2[1-(1-p)^2] ] Simplifying, we get: [ f(p) = -3p^5 + 12p^4 - 17p^3 + 9p^2 ] Substituting (p = frac{1}{2}), we find: [ fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = -3left(frac{1}{2}right)^5 + 12left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 - 17left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 + 9left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{25}{32} ] So, the probability of an employee being eliminated when (p = frac{1}{2}) is boxed{frac{25}{32}}. Part (2): For the cost analysis, we have two scenarios for each employee's test cost, (X), which can be either 120 or 200. The probabilities for these scenarios are: - (P(X=200) = C_3^1p(1-p)^2), for needing retests. - (P(X=120) = 1 - C_3^1p(1-p)^2), for not needing retests. The expected cost, (E(X)), is then: [ E(X) = 120 times [1 - C_3^1p(1-p)^2] + 200 times C_3^1p(1-p)^2 = 120 + 240p(1-p)^2 ] Let (g(x) = 120 + 240x(1-x)^2), with (x in (0,1)). The derivative of (g(x)) with respect to (x) is: [ g'(x) = 240[(1-x)^2 - 2x(1-x)] = 240(3x^2 - 4x + 1) ] This derivative simplifies to: [ g'(x) = 240(3x - 1)(x - 1) ] Analyzing (g'(x)), we find: - (g'(x) > 0) for (0 < x < frac{1}{3}), indicating (g(x)) is increasing in this interval. - (g'(x) < 0) for (x in (frac{1}{3}, 1)), indicating (g(x)) is decreasing in this interval. Thus, (g(x)) reaches its maximum at (x = frac{1}{3}), and: [ gleft(frac{1}{3}right) = 120 + 240left(frac{1}{3}right)left(1-frac{1}{3}right)^2 = frac{1400}{9} ] Therefore, the maximum expected cost per employee is frac{1400}{9} dollars. The maximum total cost for 300 employees, plus the 10,000 other costs, is: [ 300 times frac{1400}{9} + 10,000 < 60,000 ] Thus, the plan will not exceed the budget, and the final conclusion is boxed{text{No, the plan will not exceed the budget.}}"},{"prompt":"Evaluate the expression [ frac{0.128 div 3.2 + 0.86}{frac{5}{6} cdot 1.2 + 0.8} cdot frac{left(1 frac{32}{63} frac{13}{21}right) cdot 3.6}{0.505 cdot frac{2}{5} 0.002}. ]","completion":"We will solve the given expression step by step: [ frac{0.128 div 3.2 + 0.86}{frac{5}{6} cdot 1.2 + 0.8} cdot frac{left(1 frac{32}{63} - frac{13}{21} right) cdot 3.6}{0.505 cdot frac{2}{5} - 0.002} ] 1. **Calculate the numerator of the first fraction:** [ 0.128 div 3.2 + 0.86 ] [ 0.128 div 3.2 = 0.04 ] [ 0.04 + 0.86 = 0.9 ] 2. **Calculate the denominator of the first fraction:** [ frac{5}{6} cdot 1.2 + 0.8 ] [ frac{5}{6} cdot 1.2 = 1 ] [ 1 + 0.8 = 1.8 ] So, the first fraction simplifies to: [ frac{0.9}{1.8} = 0.5 ] 3. **Simplify the expression inside the second fraction:** [ 1 frac{32}{63} - frac{13}{21} ] Convert mixed fraction to improper fraction: [ 1 frac{32}{63} = frac{95}{63} ] Convert the denominator: [ frac{13}{21} = frac{13 cdot 3}{21 cdot 3} = frac{39}{63} ] Subtract the fractions: [ frac{95}{63} - frac{39}{63} = frac{56}{63} ] 4. **Calculate the numerator of the second fraction:** [ left( frac{56}{63} right) cdot 3.6 ] Simplify the fraction: [ frac{56}{63} = frac{8}{9} ] Multiply with 3.6: [ frac{8}{9} cdot 3.6 = frac{8 cdot 36}{9 cdot 10} = frac{288}{90} = frac{32}{10} = 3.2 ] 5. **Calculate the denominator of the second fraction:** [ 0.505 cdot frac{2}{5} - 0.002 ] Calculate the first part: [ 0.505 cdot frac{2}{5} = 0.505 cdot 0.4 = 0.202 ] Subtract 0.002: [ 0.202 - 0.002 = 0.2 ] So, the second fraction simplifies to: [ frac{3.2}{0.2} = 16 ] 6. **Combine all parts:** We had: [ 0.5 cdot 16 = 8 ] So the final answer is: [ boxed{8} ]"},{"prompt":"Determine both the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the cylinder and the ratio of their lateral surface areas.

The question is whether it is always possible to divide this company into three groups in such a way that each person has at least one-third of their total number of friends within their own group. 1. **Counterexample to the Claim**: Let's consider a group where the number of people is not divisible by 3, and assume a scenario where everyone is friends with everyone else. 2. **Calculations**: Since everyone is friends with everyone else, if we attempt to divide the entire group into three groups, it is inevitable that one group will have fewer than (frac{1}{3}) of the total number of individuals. For instance, suppose the total number of people, (N = 101), and each person has (N-1=100) friends (since they are friends with everyone else). Assigning people to groups in such a scenario means at least one group will have fewer than (lceil frac{101}{3} rceil = 34) people. This would lead to a case where someone in this smaller group would not meet the condition ( geq frac{1}{3} ) of their friends within the same group, since they would have fewer than ( frac{100}{3} approx 33.33 ) friends in their own group.

This will help in ensuring that the number of friends within the same group is minimized. 3. **Initial Coloring Attempt**: Consider a coloring scheme that maximizes the number of edges between differently colored vertices. This is often related to edge-partitioning in graph theory. 4. **Adjust for (1/11) Criterion**: Suppose we color the vertices aiming for maximum inter-color edges. For a person (A) in a group (say, colored red), if the number of red-colored friends exceeds ( frac{|N(A)|}{11} ), where (N(A)) is the total number of (A)'s friends, this person should be moved to another color group. 5. **Iterative Adjustment**: Every time we have such a discrepancy, moving the vertex to a different color can increase the number of inter-color edges and meet the criterion. This adjustment is finite and ensures coverage. 6. **Mathematical Argument**: Let’s assume (A) originally has (m) friends in red and (n) friends in blue. The discrepancy assumed is (m > frac{|N(A)|}{11}), implying that adjusting (A)'s color decreases (m) and (n) accounts for the total friends to satisfy the condition without violating any constraints. Conclusion: The maximum achievable condition ensures that every individual has at most (frac{|N(A)|}{11}) friends within any color group after adjustments thereby satisfying the non-friendly divide.

Hence, for ( n leq 3 ), the statement holds. Inductive Step: 2. **Assume the statement is true for ( n ):** - That is, for any set ( S ) of ( n ) points where the maximum distance between any two points is 1, there are at most ( n ) pairs of points that are exactly 1 unit apart. 3. **To prove for ( n + 1 ) points:** - Consider a set ( S ) of ( n + 1 ) points in the plane where the greatest distance between any two points is 1. - If no single point is at a distance of 1 from more than 2 other points, then each point can be connected to at most 2 other points by edges of length 1. Consequently, there can be no more than ( n + 1 ) edges, and we are done. 4. **Assume there exists a point ( P ) in ( S ) such that ( P ) is at a distance of 1 from three points ( A, B, ) and ( C ):** - With ( AP = BP = CP = 1 ), consider the angles ( angle APB, angle APC, ) and ( angle BPC ). - Without loss of generality, assume ( angle APB ) is the largest among them.

We are interested in the sum of the coefficients of the odd powers of ( x ) in this polynomial. 2. The sum of the coefficients of the odd powers of ( x ) in ( P(x) ) can be found by evaluating ( frac{P(1) - P(-1)}{2} ). This is because ( P(1) ) gives the sum of all coefficients, and ( P(-1) ) gives the sum of the coefficients of the even powers of ( x ) minus the sum of the coefficients of the odd powers of ( x ). 3.

We need to show that ( 2^{n-1} ) divides this sum. To do this, we will express the sum in terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

Notice that: [ left( frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right)^n text{ and } left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} right)^n ] are the terms in Binet's formula for the Fibonacci sequence.

Since it takes 4 bananas to make one cup of mush, we divide the number of bananas by 4 to find the number of cups of mush: 32 bananas ÷ 4 bananas/cup = 8 cups of banana mush Now, let's calculate the amount of each ingredient needed based on the proportions given in the recipe. For flour, the recipe requires 3 cups of flour for every cup of banana mush. Since Hannah has 8 cups of banana mush, she will need: 3 cups of flour/cup of banana mush × 8 cups of banana mush = 24 cups of flour For sugar, the recipe requires 2 cups of sugar for every 3 cups of banana mush.

Consider the total number of goals scored by both teams at any given moment in the match. Let n be the number of goals scored by Russia at a particular moment, and (9-n) be the number of goals scored by Tunisia at the same moment. Hence, the total number of goals scored by both teams at that moment is: [ n + (9 - n) = 9 ] 2. Let us denote the number of goals Russia still needs to score to reach a total of 9 goals as (9 - n). This expression represents the number of goals Russia needs to score at the moment when Russia has already scored n goals. 3. At any given time during the match, the number of goals scored by Tunisia can be expressed as (9 - n). Simultaneously, the number of goals Russia still needs to score to achieve their final tally of 9 goals is also (9 - n). 4. By these observations, at the moment in the match when Russia had scored n goals, the number of goals Russia still needed to score, which was (9 - n), equaled the number of goals Tunisia had scored so far, which was also (9 - n).

We want S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{10} to form an arithmetic sequence. Assume S_j = S_1 + (j-1)e for some common difference e neq 0. 5. **Ensure the equality of products:** The product of all R_i's must equal the product of all S_j's: [ R_1 cdot R_2 cdot ldots cdot R_{10} = S_1 cdot S_2 cdot ldots cdot S_{10} ] Given the arithmetic sequences, we have: [ prod_{i=1}^{10} (R_1 + (i-1)d) = prod_{j=1}^{10} (S_1 + (j-1)e) ] 6. **Constructing the table with distinct natural numbers:** One way to ensure distinct natural numbers is to use prime numbers. Let p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{100} be the first 100 prime numbers. Arrange these primes in a 10 times 10 table such that the product of each row and each column forms the desired arithmetic sequences. 7. **Verify the arithmetic sequences:** By carefully selecting the primes and arranging them, we can ensure that the row products R_i and column products S_j form nontrivial arithmetic sequences. For example, we can choose the primes such that the product of the primes in each row increases by a fixed multiplicative factor, and similarly for the columns. 8. **Conclusion:** By constructing the table with distinct primes and ensuring the products form arithmetic sequences, we have shown that such a 10 times 10 table exists.

Let ( n ) be a positive integer, ( p ) be a prime, and ( q ) be a divisor of ( (n + 1)^p - n^p ). We need to show that ( p ) divides ( q - 1 ). 2. First, observe that by Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer ( a ) and a prime ( p ), we have: [ a^p equiv a pmod{p} ] Applying this theorem, we get: [ (n+1)^p equiv n+1 pmod{p} ] and [ n^p equiv n pmod{p} ] 3. Therefore, we can write: [ (n+1)^p - n^p equiv (n+1) - n equiv 1 pmod{p} ] 4. Since ( q ) is a divisor of ( (n+1)^p - n^p ), we have: [ (n+1)^p - n^p equiv 0 pmod{q} ] 5. This implies: [ (n+1)^p equiv n^p pmod{q} ] 6. Dividing both sides by ( n^p ) (assuming ( n ) is not divisible by ( q )), we get: [ left( frac{n+1}{n} right)^p equiv 1 pmod{q} ] 7. Let ( g = frac{n+1}{n} ). Then: [ g^p equiv 1 pmod{q} ] 8. The order of ( g ) modulo ( q ), denoted as ( text{ord}_q(g) ), is the smallest positive integer ( d ) such that: [ g^d equiv 1 pmod{q} ] 9. Since ( g^p equiv 1 pmod{q} ), the order ( text{ord}_q(g) ) must divide ( p ). Because ( p ) is a prime, the possible values for ( text{ord}_q(g) ) are ( 1 ) or ( p ). 10. If ( text{ord}_q(g) = 1 ), then ( g equiv 1 pmod{q} ), which implies: [ frac{n+1}{n} equiv 1 pmod{q} implies n+1 equiv n pmod{q} implies 1 equiv 0 pmod{q} ] This is a contradiction since ( q ) is a divisor of ( (n+1)^p - n^p ) and ( q neq 1 ). 11. Therefore, ( text{ord}_q(g) = p ). By Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in the multiplicative group of integers modulo ( q ) must divide ( phi(q) ), where ( phi ) is the Euler's totient function. Hence: [ p mid phi(q) ] 12. For a prime ( q ), ( phi(q) = q - 1 ). Thus: [ p mid (q - 1) ] 13. If ( q ) is not a prime, it must be a product of primes each of which is congruent to ( 1 pmod{p} ), which implies ( q equiv 1 pmod{p} ). 14. Therefore, in both cases, we have shown that ( p mid (q - 1) ). (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Color 6 cells in a 4 times 4 grid with one color.

For positive even integer ( n ), consider the polynomials ( (x+1)^{n} ) and ( x^{n}+1 ). - Notice that [ gcd((x+1)^n, x^n+1) = 1 ] since ( (x+1)^n ) and ( x^n+1 ) are relatively prime polynomials for even ( n ). - Therefore, by the Bezout's identity in the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients, there exist polynomials ( f^*(x) ) and ( g^*(x) ) such that: [ 1 = f^{*}(x) (x+1)^n + g^{*}(x) (x^n+1). ] - Define ( k ) as a common multiple of the coefficients of the polynomials ( f^{*}(x) ) and ( g^{*}(x) ).

Define ( m = 2^alpha ). Thus, we can write: [ x^n + 1 = (x^m)^t + 1 = (x^m + 1) h(x) ] where ( h(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. - Consider the roots of ( x^m + 1 = 0 ). These roots are given by ( omega_j = e^{i cdot frac{2j-1}{m} pi} ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, m ). - For any integer ( k ) and integer polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) satisfying ( k = f(x) (x+1)^n + g(x) (x^n+1) ), thus: [ k = f(omega_j)(omega_j + 1)^n quad text{for } j = 1, 2, ldots, m. ] - Therefore, we have: [ k^m = prod_{j=1}^m f(omega_j) cdot prod_{j=1}^m (omega_j + 1)^n. ] - Let ( sigma_k ) be the elementary symmetric polynomials of ( omega_1, omega_2, ldots, omega_m ), which are integer-valued symmetric polynomials due to the symmetry and roots being from ( x^m + 1 = 0 ). - The product ( prod_{j=1}^m f(omega_j) ) can thus be expressed as an integer polynomial in ( sigma_1, sigma_2, ldots, sigma_m ), making it an integer. 3. **Simplifying the expression**: - Notice that: [ prod_{j=1}^m (omega_j + 1)^n = left(prod_{j=1}^m (omega_j + 1)right)^n = (1 + sigma_1 + sigma_2 + ldots + sigma_m)^n = 2^n. ] - Thus, we find that: [ 2^n mid k^m, ] implying ( k ) must be a power of 2, at least ( 2^t ). 4. **Constructing minimum ( k )**: - Next, constructing polynomials ( E(x) ) and ( G(x) ): [ E(x) = (x+1)(x^3 + 1) ldots (x^{2m-1} + 1) = (x+1)^m F(x), ] where roots ( omega_j, omega_j^3, ldots, omega_j^{2m-1} ) and converting this set. - Evaluating ( E(omega_j) ): [ E(omega_j) = (1+omega_j)(1+omega_j^3) ldots (1+omega_j^{2m-1}) = 2 Rightarrow G(x)(x^m + 1) + 2 = E(x) = (x+1)^m F(x), ] hence simplifying components to: [ G^*(x) (x^m + 1) + 2^t = (x+1)^n F^c(x), ] ultimately leading to: [ k = 2^t. ] 5. **Conclusion**: - Hence, the smallest value for ( k ) that satisfies the given conditions is: [ boxed{2^t} ] where ( n = 2^alpha t ) and ( t ) is an odd integer."},{"prompt":"Calculate: 1. 2^2 + 3^0 left(frac{1}{2}right)^{1} 2.

Therefore, p_{1} is true. - **Proposition p_{2}**: Any three points in space determine one and only one plane. This statement is generally true except in the case where the three points are collinear. In the scenario where the points lie on a straight line, there are infinitely many planes that can pass through this line. Hence, p_{2} is false. - **Proposition p_{3}**: If two lines in space do not intersect, then they are parallel. This statement overlooks the possibility of skew lines, which are lines that do not intersect and are not parallel because they lie in different planes.

To have no real roots, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be less than zero. The discriminant Delta is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of x^2, x, and the constant term, respectively. In this case, a = 1, b = a - 1, and c = 1. Therefore, Delta = (a-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = a^2 - 2a - 3. For Delta < 0, we have a^2 - 2a - 3 < 0. Factoring this quadratic inequality gives (a - 3)(a + 1) < 0.

Let's construct isosceles trapezoid (ABCD) such that (AB parallel CD) and (AB < CD).

Hence, the number assigned to the incenter of both triangles must equal the arithmetic mean of the values at their vertices. For triangle (XAC): [ text{Incenter of } triangle XAC = frac{a + c + x}{3} ] where (x) is the number assigned to (X).

To determine if it's possible to partition all non-negative integers into exactly 1968 non-empty classes, consider the operation stated in the problem: removing two adjacent digits or identical groups of digits from a number ( n ) should still leave this resulting number ( m ) in the same class as ( n ). 2. We start by introducing some notation. Let: - ( approx ) denote that two numbers belong to the same class. - For example, if a number ( overline{M a b N} ) (with ( M ) and ( N ) as sequences of digits) can be transformed into ( overline{M b a N} ) by reordering adjacent digits, then ( overline{M a b N} approx overline{M b a N} ). 3. Extending this, - If ( overline{M a b N} approx overline{M b b a b N} ) (since ( b b ) can be removed), - And then ( approx overline{M b a a b a b N} approx overline{M b a N} ), the operation reduces to the initial example. 4. This implies that numbers obtained by any permutation of the digits will belong to the same class. Any number can be represented as a sequence of such permutations and therefore, can be simplified to a base form through repeated adjacent digit removals. 5. Since every digit appears a certain number of times in any number, and permutations only involve reordering these digits, it's useful for the classification to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the frequency of each digit's appearance in a number. 6. Thus, every number can be characterized by a vector indicating whether each digit (from 0 to 9) appears an odd number of times. There are (2^{10} = 1024) such distinct vectors, since each digit can appear either an odd or even number of times. 7. This implies that there are potentially 1024 distinct classes based on these parities. Therefore, whatever the conditions given, the number of distinct classes cannot exceed 1024. Conclusion: Since the number of classes is at most (1024) and (1024 < 1968), it is impossible to partition all non-negative integers into exactly 1968 non-empty classes while fulfilling the conditions given.

Since f(x) has a local maximum at x = a, x = a must be a root of f'(x), i.e., f'(a) = 0. Additionally, since it is a local maximum, f'(x) should change from positive to negative as x increases through a. This implies that the graph of f'(x), a quadratic function, opens downwards and thus a > -1 in order for a to be a valid minimum. Moreover, the coefficient a of the quadratic term must be negative; hence, a < 0. Combining both conditions, we obtain the range (-1, 0) for possible values of a. To enhance the solution, let's go step by step: 1. Since x = a is a root, we can plug it into the derivative to get f'(a) = a(a + 1)(a - a) = 0. This confirms that x = a is indeed a root. 2. To determine the concavity of f'(x), we look at its leading coefficient, which is a. For f'(x) to change from positive to negative as x increases through a, the graph of f'(x) must open downwards, which means a < 0. 3. Additionally, since the factor x + 1 is present in f'(x), and we want x = a to be the local maximum, the factor x + 1 should not cause a change of sign around x = a.

Notice: - The radical axis of ( Gamma_A ) and ( Gamma_B ) is along the line connecting their centers, which is ( M_A M_B ). - Similarly, the radical axis of ( Gamma_B ) and ( Gamma_C ) aligns with line ( M_B M_C ), and of ( Gamma_C ) and ( Gamma_A ) with line ( M_C M_A ). 4. **Equal Powers**: Since the radical axis of two circles consists of points having equal power with respect to both circles: - Points ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) have equal power with respect to ( Gamma_A ) and any other circle through ( H ). - The same applies for ( B_1, B_2 ) with ( Gamma_B ), and ( C_1, C_2 ) with ( Gamma_C ). 5. **Symmetry and Radical Axis Properties**: Noting the symmetry property, ( H ) (being the orthocenter) lies on all three circles, and the symmetry of the circumcenter ( O ): - The symmetric points to ( H ) through ( M_A M_B ), ( M_B M_C ), and ( M_C M_A ) must also lie on these common radical axes. - Consequently, all aforementioned points ( A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, and C_2 ) must lie on a common circle. 6. **Conclusion**: Combining the above properties, all six points ( A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2 ) lie on the circle defined by their common radical axes and center ( O ), thereby showing they are cocyclic: [ boxed{A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2} text{ are cocyclic} ] Hence, we conclude the proof."},{"prompt":"Given an odd function f(x) defined on mathbb{R} that satisfies f(x+2) = f(x), and f(1) = 2, the value of f(2017) is ( ) A: 2 B: 0 C: 1 D: 2","completion":"Since f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R} that satisfies f(x+2) = -f(x), and given f(-1) = 2, we can deduce that f(x+4) = -f(x+2) = f(x), thus the period T = 4.

This polyhedral path is known as an Eulerian path, which requires certain properties in the graph representation of the polyhedron. Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Basic Definitions**: - An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. - For an Eulerian path to exist in a connected graph, either exactly 0 or 2 vertices must have an odd degree. 2. **Constructive Example**: - Consider gluing two tetrahedrons along a common face. - Each tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces. By gluing a common face, we get: - Vertices: 5 (4 + 4 - 3 as we remove 3 vertices from one face of each tetrahedron, keeping 1 shared face vertex). - Edges: 9 (6 + 6 - 3 as we remove 3 shared edges). - Faces: 6 (4 + 4 - 2 as we remove 2 shared faces). - Therefore, the total number of vertices, edges, and faces is (5 + 9 + 6 = 20). - This configuration can indeed support an Eulerian path since we have exactly 2 vertices (one from each tetrahedron) with an odd degree. 3. **Verification of Constraints**: - **Vertices (v)**: At least 5, otherwise we would have a tetrahedron which cannot support an Eulerian path. - **Edges (e)**: - Each vertex must be incident to at least 3 edges. - At least 2 vertices would have to be incident to an odd number of edges (for the Eulerian path to be possible). - Minimum calculation: ((3+3+4+4+4)/2 = 9) edges (since each edge connects 2 vertices). - **Faces (f)**: - Each face should be a triangle in the simplest case, otherwise we can always increase the number of faces by adding more complex polygons. - Minimum faces: (f geq 5). If f = 4, we'd be dealing with tetrahedrons again, making an Eulerian path impossible. 4. **Euler's Polyhedron Formula**: - Using Euler's formula for polyhedra: (v - e + f = 2). - Re-arranging for total count: (v + e + f). - Detect minimal polyhedron without generating repeating configurations (ensuring Eulerian path). - Minimum construct: (5 + 9 + 6 = 20).

An important property of Fibonacci numbers is that each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers: [ F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n ] **Step 2:** State the triangle inequality.

Examining the quadratic x^2 - 3x + 5, we can use the discriminant to check for real solutions: Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4(1)(5) = 9 - 20 = -11.

We need to prove that the probability (P(A_n)) that the machine stops after exactly (n) integers is: P(A_n) = frac{(n-1)!left(2^n - n - 1right)}{prod_{r=1}^{n}(2^r - 1)} # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define Events:** - Let (A_n) be the event that (n) is the least integer for which (a_n = a_k) for some (k < n). - Let (B_n) be the event that (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) are all different. 2. **Relationship Between Events (A_n) and (B_n):** - [P(A_n) = P(B_{n-1} setminus B_n) = P(B_{n-1}) - P(B_n)] 3. **Probability Calculation for All Distinct Integers:** The probability that the first (n) integers are distinct can be expressed as: P(B_n) = n! left( sum_{(a_1, ldots, a_n) in X_n} frac{1}{2^{a_1}} times frac{1}{2^{a_2}} times cdots times frac{1}{2^{a_n}} right) where (X_n = {(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) : 0 < a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_n}). 4. **Inductive Calculation for (T(n)):** Define (T(n)) as: T(n) = sum_{(a_1, ldots, a_n) in X_n} frac{1}{2^{a_1}} times frac{1}{2^{a_2}} times cdots times frac{1}{2^{a_n}} Using transformation and bijection, we derive: T(n) = frac{1}{2^n - 1} T(n-1) with initial condition (T(1) = 1). 5. **Inductive Step:** By induction, the formula for (T(n)) is: T(n) = prod_{r=1}^{n} frac{1}{2^r - 1} 6. **Final Calculation for (P(B_n)):** P(B_n) = n! T(n) = prod_{r=1}^{n} frac{r}{2^r - 1} 7. **Calculation for (P(A_n)):** P(A_n) = P(B_{n-1}) - P(B_n) Substitute the general (P(B_n)) into the above expression: begin{aligned} P(A_n) &= left(prod_{r=1}^{n-1} frac{r}{2^r - 1}right) - left(prod_{r=1}^{n} frac{r}{2^r - 1}right) &= left(1 - frac{n}{2^n - 1}right) prod_{r=1}^{n-1} frac{r}{2^r - 1} &= left(frac{2^n - 1 - n}{2^n - 1}right) prod_{r=1}^{n-1} frac{r}{2^r - 1} &= frac{(n-1)!left(2^n - n - 1right)}{prod_{r=1}^{n}(2^r - 1)}. end{aligned} In conclusion, we have: boxed{frac{(n-1)!left(2^n - n - 1right)}{prod_{r=1}^{n}(2^r - 1)}}"},{"prompt":"The quadrilateral (ABCD) is inscribed in a circle; ( l_{mathrm{a}} ) is the Simson line of point ( A ) with respect to triangle ( BCD ).

Then we have: [ g(x) = x^2 + frac{1}{x} leqslant a. ] - Since ( g(x) ) on ( [-1, 0) ) is a decreasing function, its maximum occurs at ( x = -1 ): [ g(-1) = (-1)^2 + frac{1}{-1} = 1 - 1 = 0. ] - Hence, ( a ) must satisfy: [ a geqslant 0. ] 3. **Analyzing Interval ( x in (0, 1] )**: - We need ( x^3 + 1 geqslant ax ) to hold, which can be rearranged as: [ x^3 + 1 geqslant ax implies frac{x^3 + 1}{x} geqslant a. ] - Simplify it to get: [ x^2 + frac{1}{x} geqslant a. ] - We now need to find the minimum value of ( f(x) = x^2 + frac{1}{x} ) on the interval ( (0, 1] ). 4. **Applying the AM-GM Inequality** on ( (0, 1] ): - Using the AM-GM inequality, we have: [ x^2 + frac{1}{2x} + frac{1}{2x} geqslant 3 sqrt[3]{x^2 cdot frac{1}{2x} cdot frac{1}{2x}} ] - It simplifies to: [ x^2 + frac{1}{x} geqslant frac{3sqrt[3]{2}}{2}. ] - Therefore, the minimum value on ( (0, 1] ) is: [ frac{3sqrt[3]{2}}{2}. ] - This gives us: [ a leqslant frac{3sqrt[3]{2}}{2}. ] 5. **Conclusion**: - Combining the results from both intervals, ( a ) must satisfy: [ 0 leqslant a leqslant frac{3sqrt[3]{2}}{2}. ] Thus, the range of the real number ( a ) is: [ boxed{left[0, frac{3sqrt[3]{2}}{2}right]} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a line and points A and B. Rotating the segment P A around the point P on the line onto the ray P B, let the endpoint be R. To which limit position does the point R approach as P on the line moves infinitely far in either direction?","completion":"Given a line ( e ) and points ( A ) and ( B ). The point ( P ) on the line ( e ) is such that when the segment ( PA ) is rotated around ( P ) to align with ray ( PB ), the final position of the point ( R ) on segment ( PA ) coincides with the point where ( PA ) and ( PB ) meet after rotation. We want to determine the limiting position of ( R ) as ( P ) moves infinitely far in either direction along ( e ). Step-by-Step Analysis 1. **Introduction**: - Consider points ( A ) and ( B ) in the plane and a line ( e ). - Assume ( P ) is on ( e ) and moves such that ( P ) tends to infinity in either direction along ( e ). 2. **Angle and Line Behavior**: - When ( P ) moves farther away from the perpendicular projection ( A_0 ) of ( A ) on ( e ), the angle ( angle BPA_0 ) becomes smaller. - As a result, line ( BP ) gets increasingly closer to the line ( f ), which is parallel to ( e ) and passes through ( B ). 3. **Triangle Properties**: - At point ( P ), the angle ( angle APR ) in the isosceles triangle ( APR ) becomes smaller. - As ( P ) moves farther, the angles at the base ( AR ) of triangle ( APR ) approach ( 90^circ ). - Consequently, the line ( AR ) approaches the line ( g ), which is perpendicular to ( e ) and passes through ( A ). 4. **Hypothesis**: - We hypothesize that the limiting position of ( R ) is at the intersection of lines ( f ) and ( g ), denoted ( R_0 ). 5. **Mathematical Proof**: - To prove this, for any ( varepsilon > 0 ), suitable ( d ) can be found such that if the distance ( A_0 P > d ), then the distance ( R_0 R < varepsilon ). 6. **Coordinate System Setup**: - Define a Cartesian coordinate system with the ( x )-axis along line ( e ). - Let the coordinates of the points be ( A(d,a) ), ( B(0,b) ), and ( P(x,0) ). 7. **Expressions for Distance and Coordinates**: - Distance ( PA = sqrt{(x-d)^2 + a^2} ). - Coordinates of point ( R ) are given by: [ y_R = PA sin(angle BPO) = frac{b sqrt{(x-d)^2 + a^2}}{sqrt{x^2 + b^2}} ] [ x_R = x - PA cos(angle BPO) = x - frac{x sqrt{(x-d)^2 + a^2}}{sqrt{x^2 + b^2}} ] 8. **Asymptotic Analysis**: - Evaluate the asymptotic limits as ( P ) tends to infinity (( x to pminfty )): - For ( y_R ): [ y_R = b cdot sqrt{frac{(1 - frac{d}{x})^2 + (frac{a}{x})^2}{1 + (frac{b}{x})^2}} ] [ lim_{x to pminfty} y_R = b ] - For ( x_R ): Apply algebraic manipulation: [ x_R = frac{x (sqrt{x^2 + b^2} - sqrt{(x - d)^2 + a^2})}{sqrt{x^2 + b^2}} ] Using rationalization and considering the limits: [ lim_{x to pminfty} x_R = d ] 9. **Conclusion**: - Both limits exist, and the asymptotic coordinates of point ( R ) are ( (d, b) ). So, the point ( R ) approaches the intersection point of lines ( f ) and ( g ), denoted as ( R_0 ). Therefore, the limiting position of the point ( R ) as ( P ) moves infinitely far away on the line ( e ) is the point ( (d, b) ).

Similarly, for ( L ): [ 2 overrightarrow{OL} = overrightarrow{DA_1} ] This signifies ( overrightarrow{OL} ) is half the vector from ( D ) to ( A_1 ). Finally, for ( M ): [ 2 overrightarrow{OM} = overrightarrow{A_1C_1} ] This indicates ( overrightarrow{OM} ) is half the vector from ( A_1 ) to ( C_1 ). 4. **Analysis of Cube Symmetry**: - Considering the geometric nature of the cube, the triangle formed by ( C ), ( D ), and ( A_1 ) is equilateral. Hence, the vectors ( overrightarrow{CD} ), ( overrightarrow{DA_1} ), and ( overrightarrow{A_1C_1} ) are of equal length and correspond to the sides of an equilateral triangle. 5. **Formation of ∆KLM**: - Since each vector from ( O ) to the midpoints ( K, L, M ) is half of the corresponding cube’s edge, ( overrightarrow{OK}, overrightarrow{OL}, overrightarrow{OM} ) form another set of vectors that corresponds to a triangle with sides equidistant from the cube's center. - By the properties of the cube and similarity transformations, the triangle ( KLM ) inherits the equilateral relationship and symmetry. 6. **Conclusion about the Center**: - Since ( K, L, M ) are equidistantly distributed around the cube’s center ( O ), the centroid of the triangle ( KLM ) is at ( O ). Hence, ( O ) is the center of the triangle ( KLM ) as well as the cube. Hence, we have proven that the triangle ( KLM ) is equilateral and its center coincides with the center ( O ) of the cube.

To define a \\"small number\\" in this context, we start by noting that such a number is a 10-digit number with a unique property - no smaller 10-digit number has the same digit sum. 2. Consider the sum of the digits of a 10-digit number. Each digit ranges from 0 to 9, but considering a 10-digit number (starting with a non-zero digit), the minimum sum occurs with digits ((1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)), which sums to 1, while the maximum sum occurs with digits ((9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9)), which sums to (9 times 10 = 90). 3. Therefore, the possible sums of digits for a 10-digit number range from 1 to 90, inclusive. 4. For each sum from 1 to 90, we need the smallest 10-digit number that has that digit sum. 5. Since there must be a unique smallest 10-digit number for each sum, we consider the lexicographically smallest number by rearranging the digits. - For smaller sums, this involves placing larger digits towards the end of the number. - For larger sums, this involves spreading the digits more evenly but still keeping smaller numbers towards the beginning. 6.

Consider the three cases where line ell intersects different pairs of sides of the triangle: - ell intersects AB and AC, - ell intersects AB and BC, - ell intersects AC and BC. Since these cases are essentially identical due to symmetry, let's analyze the case where ell intersects AB at M and AC at N. 2. The condition that the perimeters of the two resulting figures are equal can be written as: [ AM + MN + AN = MB + BC + CN + MN ] Simplifying, we get: [ AM + AN = MB + CN + BC ] Since AN + CN = AC = 15 and AM + MB = AB = 13, we can substitute into the equation: [ AM + AN = 12 - AN + 14 ] Bringing terms together: [ AM + AN = 27 - AM - AN ] Simplifying: [ 2(AM + AN) = 27 ] Therefore: [ AM + AN = frac{27}{2} ] 3.

Prove that each white cell...","completion":"1. **Coordinate System Setup**: Introduce a coordinate system so that the centers of the cells have integer coordinates. We will consider that the coloring pertains to the centers of the cells. Initially, color the white points into two stripes: all points with an even abscissa in green and all points with an odd abscissa in red. 2. **Graph Construction**: Let ( G ) be a graph where the vertices are the set of all black centers and the edges are the segments connecting adjacent black centers. 3. **Graph Degree**: Note that the degree of each vertex in this graph is even (0, 2, or 4) according to the problem statement. 4. **Cycle Searching**: Start moving along the edges from some vertex. Entering a vertex through some edge, we can exit through another edge. Eventually, we will return to a vertex we have already been to, forming a simple cycle ( C ). 5. **Polygon Creation**: Consider the cycle ( C ). The edges of ( C ) bound a polygon on the plane. Recolor all red and green points inside the cycle ( C ). 6. **Graph Simplification**: Move on to considering the graph ( G' ) obtained from ( G ) by removing all edges of the cycle ( C ). In the graph ( G' ), the degree of every vertex is still even, so we can find a simple cycle again, recolor, and remove the edges of that cycle. Repeat this process until there are no more edges. 7. **Final Coloring Validity**: We need to prove that the resulting coloring satisfies the problem's condition: - If a black point ( P ) has four white neighbors, during any recoloring, they were either all inside the polygon or all outside, so they were recolored the same number of times. Thus, ( P ) has two red and two green neighbors, as it had in the initial coloring. - If a black point ( P ) has two white neighbors ( K ) and ( L ) and two black neighbors ( M ) and ( N ), and if ( K ) and ( L ) lie on the same horizontal or vertical line, then ( K ) and ( L ) were in different parts of the plane relative to the cycle only during recoloring of the points inside the cycle containing path ( M P N ). Thus, the number of recolorings for ( K ) and ( L ) differs by 1. Since ( K ) and ( L ) were the same color initially, in the final coloring they will be different. - If ( K ) and ( L ) are adjacent by diagonal, during each recoloring, they were either both inside the polygon or both outside, so one will be green and the other red, as in the initial coloring.

The given translation makes the resulting function an odd function: 1. Given that the smallest positive period is pi, the angular frequency omega must be 2.

Thus, the probability (P) is computed as: [ P = frac{text{number of favorable outcomes}}{text{total number of outcomes}} = frac{1}{1} = 1 ] Therefore, the maximum probability is: [ boxed{1} ] 2. **Minimum Non-Zero Probability**: To determine the minimum possible non-zero probability: - Let’s define the segment length to be (10k + 9), where (k geq 1). This segment includes (k) numbers that are multiples of (10). - The probability (p) that a randomly selected number from this segment is divisible by (10) is given by: [ p = frac{text{number of multiples of } 10}{text{total number of numbers in the segment}} = frac{k}{10k + 9} ] We aim to find the minimum value: [ p = frac{k}{10k + 9} ] Rewriting the expression in a useful form: [ p = frac{1}{10} - frac{9}{10(10k + 9)} ] To find the minimum value of (p), consider (k = 1) (since (k geq 1)): - For (k = 1): [ p = frac{1}{10 cdot 1 + 9} = frac{1}{19} ] Thus, the minimum non-zero probability is: [ boxed{frac{1}{19}} ]"},{"prompt":"The real part of the complex number i^2(12i)","completion":"The complex number i^2(1-2i) equals -(1-2i) = -1 + 2i.

We need to show that the expression [ left(a^{2}-1right)left(b^{2}-1right)left(a^{6}-b^{6}right) ] is divisible by 290304. Let's break down this problem step by step: 1. **Divisibility of a^2 - 1 and b^2 - 1**: Each of a^2 - 1 and b^2 - 1 is of the form (a+1)(a-1) and (b+1)(b-1) respectively: - Since a is a prime number greater than 2, both a+1 and a-1 are even, making a^2 - 1 divisible by 2^2 = 4. Further, since a is an odd number, either a+1 or a-1 is divisible by 4. Therefore, a^2 - 1 is actually divisible by 2^3 = 8. - Additionally, among a-1, a, and a+1, one of these numbers is divisible by 3 since they form three consecutive integers. Since a is a prime, it is not divisible by 3, hence either a-1 or a+1 must be divisible by 3. Therefore, a^2 - 1 is divisible by 3. Combining these, a^2 - 1 is divisible by 2^3 cdot 3 = 24. Similarly, b^2 - 1 is also divisible by 24. 2. **Divisibility of a^6 - b^6**: The expression a^6 - b^6 can be factored using the difference of squares: [ a^6 - b^6 = (a^3 - b^3)(a^3 + b^3) ] Further factoring gives: [ a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) quad text{and} quad a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) ] Since a and b are primes greater than 3, their differences and sums have similar considerations as the first step: - The difference or sum of two numbers each either one unit less or more than a multiple of 6 is a multiple of 6 = 2 cdot 3. Thus, a^6 - b^6 itself must be divisible by 2^3 cdot 3 since a^2 + ab + b^2 and other factors retain divisibility by 2 cdot 3. - Furthermore, if a and b are not divisible by 3 (which they are not, since they are primes greater than 3), each term a^3 - b^3 and a^3 + b^3 reinforces the divisibility. 3. **Osztás 7-tel**: Given primes a and b of the form (mod 7): [ a = 7k pm 1, 7k pm 2, 7k pm 3 ] Raising these to the 6th power and examining the results modulo 7, all such forms reduce modulo 7 to: [ (7k pm 1)^6 equiv 1 pmod{7}, qquad (7k pm 2)^6 equiv 1 pmod{7}, qquad (7k pm 3)^6 equiv 1 pmod{7} ] showing (a^6 - b^6) is divisible by 7. 4. **Combining everything**: We have established: [ a^2 - 1 quad text{and} quad b^2 - 1 quad text{are divisible by}quad 2^3 cdot 3 = 24 ] [ a^6 - b^6 quad text{is divisible by}quad 2^3 cdot 3^2 cdot 7 = 504 ] Therefore, [ left(a^{2}-1right)left(b^{2}-1right)left(a^{6}-b^{6}right) quad text{is divisible by} quad (24 cdot 24 cdot 504) = 2^{9} cdot 3^{4} cdot 7 = 290304 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{290304} ]"},{"prompt":"Determine how many integers satisfy the inequality (6 leq 3x + 2 leq 9).","completion":"First, we isolate ( 3x ) by subtracting 2 from each part of the inequality: [ -6 - 2 leq 3x + 2 - 2 leq 9 - 2 implies -8 leq 3x leq 7 ] Next, we divide the entire inequality by 3 to solve for ( x ): [ -8/3 leq x leq 7/3 ] Now, we identify the integers within the range ( -frac{8}{3} leq x leq frac{7}{3} ).

We need to prove that if varphi maps the four vertices of any rectangle to the vertices of another rectangle, then varphi is a similarity transformation. The proof proceeds in several steps: 1. **Invariance of Right Triangles:** We start by showing that varphi preserves right triangles. Consider a right triangle triangle ABC. We can complete it to a rectangle ABCD (where D is the fourth vertex). Under the transformation varphi, the points varphi(A), varphi(B), varphi(C), varphi(D) form the vertices of a rectangle. Therefore, any three of these points form a right triangle because three vertices of a rectangle will always form a right triangle. This implies that varphi maps right triangles to right triangles. 2. **Collinearity:** Next, we show that varphi preserves collinearity of points. If x, y, z are collinear points, then varphi(x), varphi(y), varphi(z) must also be collinear. - Assume A, B, C are not collinear. There are finitely many points P such that among the triangles triangle ABP, triangle ACP, triangle BCP, at least two are right triangles. Each right triangle condition places P on either a perpendicular bisector of a side or a Thales circle around the respective side. Thus, there are only finitely many such points due to intersections of these loci. - If A, B, and C are collinear, then there are infinitely many P that make at least two out of triangle ABP, triangle ACP, triangle BCP right triangles, such as the perpendicular from A, B, or C. Suppose X, Y, Z are collinear. By the above arguments, there are infinitely many P such that at least two of triangle XYP, triangle XZP, triangle YZP are right triangles. Hence, varphi applied to these implies varphi(X), varphi(Y), varphi(Z) must also be collinear since varphi is injective (one-to-one). 3. **Order on a Line:** varphi retains the order of points lying on a line. If X, Y, Z are distinct and collinear, and Y lies between X and Z, we need to show varphi(Y) lies between varphi(X) and varphi(Z). - If R_1 and R_2 satisfy triangle XYR_1, triangle XZR_1, triangle YZR_1 and triangle XYR_2, triangle XZR_2, triangle YZR_2 being right triangles, then varphi(R_1) and varphi(R_2) must satisfy similar conditions with varphi(X), varphi(Y), varphi(Z). - Since exactly one of varphi(R_1) varphi(Y) varphi(R_2) must be collinear and since varphi is bijective and collinearity-preserving, varphi(Y) must lie between varphi(X) and varphi(Z). 4. **Midpoints:** varphi preserves midpoints. If Y is the midpoint of segment R_1R_2, we need to show that varphi(Y) is also the midpoint of varphi(R_1)varphi(R_2). - Find points X and Z such that triangle XR_1Y, triangle XRYZ, triangle YZR_1 are right as required. varphi then maps these to varphi(X), varphi(Y), varphi(Z) making similar conditions hold. Thus varphi(Y) must be the midpoint of varphi(R_1)varphi(R_2). 5. **Squares to Squares:** Given that varphi preserves midpoints, it follows that varphi maps the vertices of a square to the vertices of another square. This involves considering a square ABCD with center K and noting that varphi maps its vertices to those of another square and the center to the center. 6. **Similarity Transformation:** Finally, consider a Cartesian coordinate system with origin O and points E_1 and E_2 such that overline{OE_1} = overline{OE_2} = 1. The transformed coordinates will be equally spaced allowing the transformation varphi to scale distances by a factor e. For any segment PQ, this scale factor allows us to conclude: [ |overline{OP_1} - frac{1}{e}overline{varphi(O) varphi(P_1)}| < frac{1}{n} ] This deduces that the transformation scales coordinates uniformly. Thus, based on transformations for right triangles, collinearity, midpoints, and squares, we conclude that varphi is indeed a similarity transformation. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A line passing through the vertex (C) of an isosceles triangle (ABC) intersects the base (AB) at point (M) and the circumscribed circle at point (N).

(2) Given that a=frac{1}{2}, and Xiao Ming needs a score of at least 50 points to win a prize, find the probability of Xiao Ming winning a prize.","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Given that the probability of Xiao Ming answering all three questions correctly is frac{1}{6}, we start by calculating the probability of this event using the probabilities of answering each question correctly: frac{3}{4} times frac{2}{3} times a = frac{1}{6} Solving for a, we find: a = frac{1}{3} Next, we calculate the probability of answering exactly one of the three questions correctly. This can happen in three ways: 1. Correctly answering the algebra question only: frac{3}{4} times frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{3} 2. Correctly answering the geometry question only: frac{1}{4} times frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{3} 3. Correctly answering the combinatorics question only: frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{3} times frac{2}{3} Adding these probabilities together, we get: frac{3}{4} times frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4} times frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{3} times frac{2}{3} = frac{11}{36} Therefore, the probability of answering exactly one of the three questions correctly is boxed{frac{11}{36}}. Part 2: Given a=frac{1}{2}, we calculate the probability of Xiao Ming winning a prize, which requires a score of at least 50 points. We consider the different ways to achieve this score: 1. **All three questions are answered correctly (X=100):** P(X=100) = frac{3}{4} times frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4} 2. **The combinatorics question is answered correctly and exactly one of the algebra or geometry questions is answered correctly (X=60):** P(X=60) = frac{3}{4} times frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} times frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4} 3. **Both algebra and geometry questions are answered correctly but the combinatorics question is not (X=50):** P(X=50) = frac{3}{4} times frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{8} Adding these probabilities together to find the total probability of scoring at least 50 points, we get: P(X geq 50) = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{8} = frac{5}{8} + frac{1}{8} = frac{6}{8} = frac{3}{4} Therefore, the probability of Xiao Ming winning a prize is boxed{frac{3}{4}}."},{"prompt":"The difference between the larger root and the smaller root of x^2 px + (p^2 1)/4 = 0 is: textbf{(A)} 0qquadtextbf{(B)} 1qquadtextbf{(C)} 2qquadtextbf{(D)} pqquadtextbf{(E)} p+1","completion":"1. **Identify the roots**: Let the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - px + frac{p^2 - 1}{4} = 0 be r and s, where r geq s. 2. **Apply Vieta's formulas**: Vieta's formulas tell us that the sum of the roots (r+s) is equal to the coefficient of x with the opposite sign, and the product of the roots (rs) is equal to the constant term.

We know that i^1 = i, i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, and i^4 = 1. This pattern repeats every four powers, so for any integer k, we have: - i^{4k+1} = i - i^{4k+2} = -1 - i^{4k+3} = -i - i^{4k+4} = 1 Given this, we can see that the sum of any four consecutive powers of i is zero because i + (-1) + (-i) + 1 = 0. Therefore, when we sum up the powers of i from i to i^{2023}, we can group them into sets of four, each summing to zero, with three terms left over (i^{2021}, i^{2022}, and i^{2023}). These last three terms are i, -1, and -i, respectively. Their sum is i - 1 - i = -1.

This constructs triangle ( triangle ABC ). 3. **Bisecting Internal Angles at Points B and C**: Use the method of a two-sided ruler to bisect the internal angles at vertices ( B ) and ( C ). To do this, align the ruler with one leg of the angle at ( B ) to find the midpoint that equally divides the internal angle. Repeat this process to bisect the angle at ( C ). 4. **Bisecting External Angles at Points B and C**: Similarly, using the two-sided ruler, bisect the external angles at vertices ( B ) and ( C ). One way to approach this is to extend the sides of triangle ( triangle ABC ) from ( B ) and ( C ) and find the midpoints of these external angles. 5. **Finding the Intersection Point**: The intersection point of the internal angle bisectors and the intersection point of the external angle bisectors from ( B ) and ( C ) should be determined. 6. **Constructing the Angle Bisector**: The line passing through point ( A ) and the intersection point found by bisection of both internal and external angles will be the angle bisector of the inaccessible angle at ( A ). # Conclusion: The process of bisecting the angle at the inaccessible vertex ( A ) using just a two-sided ruler involves constructing and intersecting internal and external angle bisectors at accessible points ( B ) and ( C ).

Therefore, we have: f'(2) = 3 cdot 2^{2} - 4c cdot 2 + c^{2} = 12 - 8c + c^{2} = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get the possible values of c: c^{2} - 8c + 12 = (c-6)(c-2) = 0. Hence, c=6 or c=2. However, we need to determine which value of c actually corresponds to a local maximum at x=2. The second derivative of f(x) is f''(x) = 6x - 4c. Substituting c=6 into f''(x) gives: f''(2) = 6 cdot 2 - 4 cdot 6 = 12 - 24 = -12, which is less than zero, indicating a concave down parabola, consistent with a local maximum. Substituting c=2 into f''(x) gives: f''(2) = 6 cdot 2 - 4 cdot 2 = 12 - 8 = 4, which is greater than zero, indicating a concave up parabola, and thus a local minimum, which contradicts the initial statement that x=2 is a local maximum.

If three people each play a game of rockpaperscissorslizardSpock at the same time by choosing one of the five moves at random, what is the probability that one player beats the other two?","completion":"The problem asks us to determine the probability that one player beats the other two in a game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock among three participants choosing randomly. Let's denote the three players as A, B, and C. We need to compute the probability that one player defeats the other two. 1. **Break Down the Problem by Symmetry:** The events where A beats both B and C, B beats both A and C, and C beats both A and B are mutually exclusive. This means we can add their probabilities to find the overall probability. Since the game is symmetric in nature, each event has the same probability. 2. **Calculate the Probability for One Specific Case:** Without loss of generality, let's compute the probability that player A beats both players B and C. 3. **Winning Conditions:** By the rules given, each move can defeat 2 of the other 4 possible moves. Therefore, if A chooses any particular move, there are exactly 2 moves each where B and C are defeated. For example, if A chooses \\"rock,\\" then B and C should choose either \\"scissors\\" or \\"lizard\\" to satisfy the winning condition for A. 4. **Probability Calculation:** Each player independently chooses one of the 5 moves uniformly at random. Thus, the probability that B selects a move that A defeats (given A's move) is frac{2}{5}. Similarly, the probability that C also selects a move that A defeats (given A's move) is again frac{2}{5}. Therefore, the probability that both B and C select moves that A defeats given A’s move is: [ left(frac{2}{5}right) cdot left(frac{2}{5}right) = frac{4}{25} ] 5. **Total Probability:** Since the same argument holds for each player due to the symmetry, the total probability that one player defeats the other two players is: [ 3 cdot left(frac{4}{25}right) = frac{12}{25} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the probability that one player beats the other two in a game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is: [ boxed{frac{12}{25}} ]"},{"prompt":"There are 8 people standing in a row, among them A, B, and C are not adjacent to each other, and D and E are also not adjacent to each other.

What is the smallest possible number of obtuse triangles in the triangulation?","completion":"1. To solve this problem, consider a general ( n )-gon inscribed in a circle and perform a triangulation such that no diagonals intersect except at the vertices. 2. It is well-known that any triangulation of an ( n )-gon, where ( n geq 3 ), divides the ( n )-gon into ( n - 2 ) triangles. This fact can be proven by induction or through Euler’s formula for planar graphs. - **Basis step**: For ( n = 3 ), a triangle obviously forms 1 triangle, which is ( 3 - 2 = 1 ). - **Inductive step**: Suppose an ( n )-gon can be triangulated into ( n - 2 ) triangles. When adding one more vertex to form an ( (n+1) )-gon, we can draw ( n - 3 ) diagonals from this new vertex to split it into ( n + 1 - 2 = n - 1 ) triangles, confirming the claim. 3. A triangle in a circle (cyclic polygon) is obtuse if and only if one of its interior angles is greater than ( 90^circ ). A triangle has this property if and only if the center of the circle is not inside or exactly on its boundary. 4. Therefore, for a triangle to be acute, the circle’s center must either lie inside the triangle or be exactly along one of the triangle's sides. 5. Due to the central symmetry and properties of a circle, observations reveal that at most, only 2 such triangles can avoid being obtuse: those that involve the center of the circle within or on their sides. 6. To minimize the number of obtuse triangles, we aim to maximize the number of non-obtuse (acute or right) triangles. The best configuration places the center of the circle on the side of a triangle, resulting in no more than 2 such triangles. 7. Consequently, the least number of obtuse triangles (those not containing or touching the center) will be given by: [ text{Number of obtuse triangles} = text{Total number of triangles} - text{Non-obtuse triangles} ] [ text{Number of obtuse triangles} = (2003 - 2) - 2 ] [ text{Number of obtuse triangles} = 2001 - 2 = 1999 ] # Conclusion [ boxed{1999} ]"},{"prompt":"A wooden box of dimensions 4 m x 2 m x 4 m is to carry rectangular boxes of dimensions 4 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm.

Let's outline the steps and reasoning in detail. 1. **Projective Transformation**: Since this problem involves the intersection of lines and points lying on a line within a convex quadrilateral, we use the method of projective transformations. Specifically, consider a projective transformation that maps the line ( PQ ) to infinity. Under this transformation, ( P ) and ( Q ) become points at infinity, turning ( PQ ) into the \\"line at infinity\\". 2. **Redefinition in Projective Space**: - After the projective transformation, let's redefine our points and lines in terms of more familiar geometric terms based on the given configuration: - (A), (B), (C), (D) are points of a quadrilateral. - ( P ) is the intersection of line extensions (AB) and (CD). - ( Q ) is the intersection of line extensions (AD) and (BC). - ( R ) is an arbitrary point inside the quadrilateral. - ( K ) is the intersection of ( BC ) and ( PR ). - ( L ) is the intersection of ( AB ) and ( QR ). - ( M ) is the intersection of ( AK ) and ( DR ). 3. **Utilize the Desargues' Theorem**: This problem extrapolates from Desargues' theorem in projective geometry: - Desargues' theorem states that if two triangles are in perspective axially (their sides intersecting at three points collinear), then they are in perspective centrally (their corresponding vertices meeting in a single point), and vice versa. - By applying Desargues' theorem to the involved points and lines, we can show that the following holds: - Let triangles ( triangle ABQ ) and ( triangle CDP ) be two triangles formed before the projective transformation. - If the lines ( AP ), ( BQ ), and ( CR ) intersect at a single point (let's denote it as some auxiliary point ( O )), then the intersection points of pairs of corresponding sides lie on a straight line. 4. **Collinearity of Points**: - After applying the projective transformation and the corresponding Desargues' configuration, consider the transformed problem (point (M) may be renamed depending on our transformation to the projective plane). - Since points (A), (B), (C), and (D) form a quadrilateral and considering the intersections produced by extensions (considered after projective transformation), it follows by projective properties and Desargues' theorem that intersection points such as (L(M), C,) should lie collinearly. 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, through the application of projective transformation and reapplying geometric properties to the new configuration, we ascertain that points (L), (M), and (C) do indeed lie on the same straight line.

In trapezoids ABFE and CDEF, we construct the intersection points of the diagonals, denoted as P and Q respectively. Show that PQ is parallel to the bases of the trapezoids.","completion":"To demonstrate that PQ is parallel to the bases of the trapezoids, we will start by discussing the properties of the diagonals in any trapezoid and the inherent similarity of resulting triangles when a trapezoid is split along its diagonals. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Diagonal Intersection Property in a Trapezoid**: - Let's consider any trapezoid XYZV where XY and ZV are the bases. The diagonals XZ and YV intersect at point W. - The triangles XYW and ZVW are similar. This is because the corresponding angles at X and Z, Y and V are equal due to alternate interior angles and the vertical angles at W being equal. - Hence, the similarity ratio of the triangles XYW and ZVW is frac{XY}{ZV}. 2. **Implication of Similarity**: - This similarity implies that the heights of these triangles from W to the bases XY and ZV also have the same ratio, i.e., [ frac{text{height from } W text{ to } XY}{text{height from } W text{ to } ZV} = frac{XY}{ZV} ] - These heights are essentially the perpendicular distances from W to the bases XY and ZV. 3. **Application to Our Problem**: - In the trapezoids ABFE and CDEF from the problem statement, consider the intersection points of the diagonals as P and Q respectively. - For trapezoid ABFE, the height ratio from point P to AB and FE is frac{AE}{BF}, since P divides the diagonals proportionally to the bases. - For trapezoid CDEF, the height ratio from point Q to CD and FE is frac{DE}{CF} due to the same reasoning. 4. **Use of the Intercept Theorem**: - By the intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem) in triangle AME and triangle CMF, we know: [ frac{AE}{BF} = frac{ME}{MF} = frac{DE}{CF} ] - Since ME = MF based on the problem's constraints (point M being common intersection), it follows frac{ME}{MF} = 1, clearly syncing with our ratios for P and Q heights to their respective trapezoids. 5. **Conclusion**: - Having established the proportional heights, we conclude that P and Q are equidistant from AD and BC, hence PQ is parallel to both AD and BC.

To prove it, we will analyze his strategy in stages. **Step 2:** Number all the sandwiches from 1 to 3^{100}.
