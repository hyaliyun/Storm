To be within (triangle XYZ): [ frac{x}{a} < frac{y}{b} + frac{z}{c} ] - This inequality must be satisfied on the same side of the line ( YZ ). - Since point ( A = (1, 0, 0) ) does not satisfy this inequality, the region between the lines forming (triangle ABC) and the other regions ( CAZX ) and ( ABXY ) also must be in consideration. 7. **Conclusion:** Intersecting these inequalities and regions implies that ( P ) lies within (triangle XYZ), the Cevian triangle of the incenter ( I ). Therefore, ( P ) is inside (triangle XYZ) if and only if the lengths ( PD, PE, ) and ( PF ) form a triangle.

We use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s: Relative speed (in m/s) = 54 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed (in m/s) = 54 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed (in m/s) = 54 * (5 / 18) Relative speed (in m/s) = 15 m/s Now that we have the relative speed in meters per second, we can use the time it takes for the train to pass the man to find the length of the train: Length of train = Relative speed * Time Length of train = 15 m/s * 9.332586726395222 s Length of train = 139.98880089592833 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{139.99} meters."},{"prompt":"Given a=log _{3}2, b=sin 1, c=3^{0.5}, the relationship between a, b, and c is ( ).

We observe that: [ 2n + 1 = (n+1)^2 - n^2 ] This is because: [ (n+1)^2 - n^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2 = 2n + 1 ] Hence, any odd number can be represented as the difference of two squares. 2. **Understanding Representation of Even Numbers That Are Multiples of 4**: Any even number that is a multiple of 4 can be expressed in the form (4m). We observe that: [ 4m = (m+1)^2 - (m-1)^2 ] This is because: [ (m+1)^2 - (m-1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 - (m^2 - 2m + 1) = 4m ] Thus, any number that is a multiple of 4 can be represented as the difference of two squares. 3. **Numbers that cannot be represented as differences of squares**: We now consider numbers of the form (4n + 2). These numbers cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares. This follows from the properties of squares under modulo operations: - A square number modulo 4 can only yield a remainder of 0 or 1. - Hence, any difference of two squares modulo 4 must result in a difference of 0, 1, or 3. Any number of the form (4n + 2) is thus impossible to achieve. 4. **Counting numbers of the form (4n + 2) from 1 to 1000**: Within any group of four consecutive integers, exactly one number has the form (4n + 2). Therefore, in the range from 1 to 1000, we calculate the quantity of such numbers by dividing 1000 by 4: [ frac{1000}{4} = 250 ] Thus, there are 250 numbers between 1 and 1000 that cannot be represented as the difference of two squares. # Conclusion: [ boxed{250} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that frac {1}{cosalpha} and tanalpha are the two roots of the equation x^2+3x+m=0, find the value of the real number m.","completion":"By Vieta's theorem, we have frac {1}{cosalpha}+tanalpha=-3, which simplifies to frac {1+sinalpha}{cosalpha}=-3.

Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Symmetry of f(x) around x=1:** Since it is given that y=f(x+1) is an even function, we can infer that the function f(x) is symmetric about the line x=1. This is because if f(x+1) is even, then f(1+x) = f(1-x), which directly translates to the symmetry of f(x) around x=1. 2. **Monotonicity of f(x) on left(-infty, 1right]:** It is given that for any x_1, x_2 in left(-infty, 1right] and x_1 neq x_2, we have (x_1-x_2)(f(x_2)-f(x_1)) > 0. This condition means that if x_1 < x_2, then f(x_1) > f(x_2), indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval left(-infty, 1right]. To see this more clearly, rearranging the given inequality yields (x_1-x_2)(f(x_1)-f(x_2)) < 0, which further supports the fact that f(x) decreases as x increases within left(-infty, 1right]. 3. **Impact of symmetry and monotonicity on f(x) values:** Given the symmetry of f(x) about x=1 and its decreasing nature on left(-infty, 1right], we can deduce how f(x) behaves across different values of x. Specifically, as x moves further away from the axis of symmetry (x=1), in either direction, the value of f(x) increases due to the even nature and the monotonicity on the left side of the axis.

From the first box, he bought 10 movies at 2.00 each, so that's 10 * 2.00 = 20.00. From the second box, he bought 5 movies at 5.00 each, so that's 5 * 5.00 = 25.00. From the third box, he bought 3 movies at 7.00 each, so that's 3 * 7.00 = 21.00. Now, we add up the total cost of all the DVDs: 20.00 + 25.00 + 21.00 = 66.00.

From the first information, we have: N = 44 * 432 + R1 where R1 is the remainder when N is divided by 44. From the second information, we have: N = 30 * Q2 + 18 where Q2 is the quotient when N is divided by 30. Since N is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other: 44 * 432 + R1 = 30 * Q2 + 18 We need to find R1, the remainder when N is divided by 44. To do this, we need to find a value for Q2 that makes the right side of the equation divisible by 44, leaving us with the remainder R1. Let's first calculate 44 * 432: 44 * 432 = 19008 Now we have: 19008 + R1 = 30 * Q2 + 18 We know that 19008 is divisible by 44, so we need to find a multiple of 30 that, when added to 18, gives us a number that is just over a multiple of 44. Let's find the remainder when 19008 is divided by 30 to see how much we need to add to get to a multiple of 30: 19008 mod 30 = 8 This means that when 19008 is divided by 30, the remainder is 8. To get to the next multiple of 30, we would need to add 22 (since 30 - 8 = 22). However, we are told that when N is divided by 30, the remainder is 18, not 22. This means that the number we are looking for is 18 - 8 = 10 more than 19008. So, let's add 10 to 19008: 19008 + 10 = 19018 Now, 19018 is the number that, when divided by 30, gives us a remainder of 18. We need to find the remainder when 19018 is divided by 44. 19018 mod 44 = R1 To find R1, we can simply calculate 19018 divided by 44 and find the remainder: 19018 mod 44 = 18 Therefore, the remainder in the first division (when the number is divided by 44) is boxed{18} ."},{"prompt":"Andrew, Boris, Svetlana, and Larisa are four people of different ages, forming two married couples.

Understanding the Clues - **Clue 1:** The oldest person is Larisa’s husband. - **Clue 2:** Andrey is younger than Svetlana but older than Larisa. From **Clue 1**, we can deduce that the oldest person is a man, and he is married to Larisa. Let’s denote this oldest person as Boris due to the pairings. Therefore, Boris is Larisa’s husband. From **Clue 2**, we know: - Andrey < Svetlana - Larisa < Andrey So the possible order of ages from youngest to oldest is: Larisa < Andrey < Svetlana < Boris. 2. Determining the Pairings - Since Boris is the oldest and Larisa’s husband, that means Andrey must be married to Svetlana because Larisa is married to Boris. 3. Evaluating Statements Let’s evaluate each statement provided in the problem: - **Statement 1:** Andrey is older than Boris and is married to Svetlana. - This statement contradicts our ordering since Boris is the oldest, and Andrey is not older than Boris. - **Statement 2:** Andrey is older than his wife Svetlana. - This is incorrect because according to **Clue 2**, Andrey is younger than Svetlana. - **Statement 3:** The youngest person is Larisa, and she is married to Boris. - This is true because our order is Larisa < Andrey < Svetlana < Boris, and we already established Boris is married to Larisa. - **Statement 4:** Svetlana is older than Larisa, and her husband is Boris. - Svetlana is indeed older than Larisa, but her husband is not Boris.

Convert the given polar coordinate equation of line l to its corresponding Cartesian coordinate equation: The polar coordinate equation of line l is 2rho sin (theta - frac{pi }{4})=sqrt{2}. Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we have: y = rho sin(theta) and x = rho cos(theta) y - x = sqrt{2} sin(theta - frac{pi}{4}) = sqrt{2} (frac{sqrt{2}}{2}sin(theta) - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}cos(theta)) = y - x Thus, the Cartesian coordinate equation of line l is y - x = 1. 2. Find the Cartesian coordinates of point A: The polar coordinates of point A are A(2sqrt{2}, frac{7pi}{4}). Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we have: x = rho cos(theta) = 2sqrt{2}cos(frac{7pi}{4}) = 2 y = rho sin(theta) = 2sqrt{2}sin(frac{7pi}{4}) = -2 Thus, the Cartesian coordinates of point A are (2, -2). 3.

There are two scenarios in which the product xy can be even: 1. x is even and y is any number from its set. 2. y is even (which is 6) and x is any number from its set. Let's calculate the probability for each scenario: 1. The probability that x is even is 2/6 (since there are 2 even numbers out of 6 total numbers in the set for x). The probability that y is any number is 1 (since it can be any of the 5 numbers in its set). So the probability for this scenario is (2/6) * 1 = 2/6. 2. The probability that y is even is 1/5 (since there is 1 even number out of 5 total numbers in the set for y). The probability that x is any number is 1 (since it can be any of the 6 numbers in its set). So the probability for this scenario is (1/5) * 1 = 1/5. Now, we need to combine these probabilities, but we must be careful not to double-count the scenario where both x and y are even (which is when x=2 or 4 and y=6). This scenario is included in both of the probabilities we calculated, so we subtract it once to get the correct total probability. The probability that both x and y are even is (2/6) * (1/5) = 2/30.

Let's consider the cases: - **Case 1:** Both numerator and denominator are positive. For the numerator x+1 > 0 Rightarrow x > -1. For the denominator x-2 > 0 Rightarrow x > 2. Combining these, we have x > 2 because this condition encompasses x > -1 and is more restrictive. - **Case 2:** Both numerator and denominator are negative. For the numerator x+1 < 0 Rightarrow x < -1. For the denominator x-2 < 0 Rightarrow x < 2. Combining these, we get x < -1 because this condition is not satisfied for any x between -1 and 2 due to the denominator's condition (x < 2) conflicting with the positive condition found earlier (x > 2). 3.

First, categorize solutions based on possible values of (x). 3. **Range of (x):** The variable (x) can take values: [ x = 0, 1, 2, ldots, leftlfloor frac{n}{4} rightrfloor ] where (leftlfloor frac{n}{4} rightrfloor) denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to (frac{n}{4}). 4. **Simplifying (y + z):** For each (x), the equation for (y) and (z) becomes: [ y + z = n - 4x ] This equation must be satisfied for values of (x) within the given range. 5. **Counting Solutions for Each ((y + z = k)):** Based on combinatorial principles, the number of non-negative integer solutions to (y + z = k) (where (k) is a non-negative integer) is given by: [ k + 1 ] Thus, for each (x), the corresponding values of (y + z) are: [ n, n-4, n-8, ldots, n-4leftlfloor frac{n}{4} rightrfloor ] 6. **Sum of Solutions:** The sequence above forms an arithmetic sequence with terms: [ n + 1, n - 3, n - 7, ldots, n + 1 - 4leftlfloor frac{n}{4} rightrfloor ] The sum of this sequence can be given by the formula: [ s(n) = left(leftlfloor frac{n}{4} rightrfloor + 1right) left(n + 1 - 2leftlfloor frac{n}{4} rightrfloorright) ] 7. **Detailed Calculation:** This can be further simplified into a single expression: [ s(n) = leftlfloor frac{n^2 + 6n + 9}{8} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{(n + 3)^2}{8} rightrfloor ] Another way to present this is: [ s(n) = frac{(n+2)(n+4)}{8} ] Here, (s(n)) is the nearest integer to the given expression. # Conclusion: The number of possible compositions of visitors to the exhibition, where the total amount paid is (n) Ft, is given by: [ boxed{leftlfloor frac{(n+3)^2}{8} rightrfloor} ]"},{"prompt":"Given 0 leq a_k leq 1 for k=1,2,ldots,2020, and defining a_{2021}=a_1, a_{2022}=a_2, find the maximum value of sum_{k=1}^{2020}left(a_{k}a_{k+1} a_{k+2}right).","completion":"Given that: [ 0 leq a_k leq 1 quad text{for} ; k = 1, 2, ldots, 2020 ] and with the periodic condition: [ a_{2021}=a_1, quad a_{2022}=a_2 ] We are required to find the maximum value of the expression: [ sum_{k=1}^{2020} left(a_k - a_{k+1} a_{k+2}right) ] Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Initial Observations**: - Since (0 leq a_k leq 1), for any (k = 1, 2, ldots, 2020), we also have that (0 leq 1 - a_k leq 1). 2. **Inequality Analysis**: - Consider the expression: [ left(1 - a_kright)left(1 - a_{k+1}right) geq 0 ] - Expanding this, we get: [ 1 - a_k - a_{k+1} + a_k a_{k+1} geq 0 ] - Rearranging terms, we have: [ 1 geq a_k + a_{k+1} - a_k a_{k+1} ] 3. **Summing Over Indices**: - We need to connect this result to our given sum.

For periodicity, (a_{2021} = a_1): [ sum_{k=1}^{2020} a_k + sum_{k=1}^{2020} a_{k+1} - sum_{k=1}^{2020} 2a_k a_{k+1} ] - Notice that (sum_{k=1}^{2020} a_{k+1}) is just a shifted version of (sum_{k=1}^{2020} a_k): [ 2 sum_{k=1}^{2020} a_k - 2 sum_{k=1}^{2020} a_k a_{k+1} ] - Thus: [ 2020 geq 2 sum_{k=1}^{2020} a_k - 2 sum_{k=1}^{2020} a_k a_{k+1} ] - Dividing by 2: [ 1010 geq sum_{k=1}^{2020} left(a_k - a_{k+1} a_{k+2}right) ] Therefore, we find that: [ sum_{k=1}^{2020} left(a_k - a_{k+1} a_{k+2}right) leq 1010 ] 5. **Verification for Maximum Value**: - When (a_1 = a_3 = dots = a_{2017} = a_{2019} = 1) and the rest are zero, observe: [ left(a_k - a_{k+1} a_{k+2}right) = 1 ] - Since there are 1010 such terms, the sum achieves its maximum value.

Therefore, there are 5 choices for the units place. 2. **Hundreds place (the first digit)**: The first digit cannot be 0 (to ensure it's a three-digit number) and it must be different from the digit chosen for the units place. Therefore, there are 9 choices for the hundreds place (10 total digits minus 1 already chosen for the units place). 3. **Tens place (the middle digit)**: This digit must be different from the ones chosen for the hundreds and units places. Therefore, there are 8 choices left for the tens place. Multiplying the number of choices for each position together, we get the total number of possible three-digit even numbers without repeating digits: 5 times 9 times 8 = 360. However, we must consider that when the units place is chosen as 0, the hundreds place actually has 9 options (since 0 is now a valid option for the hundreds place, but we cannot repeat the digit chosen for the units place). This means our initial calculation overestimates the number of possibilities. To correct this, we calculate the scenario where the units place is 0 separately: - **Units place is 0**: There are 1 choice for the units place, 9 choices for the hundreds place (any digit but 0), and 8 choices for the tens place. This gives 1 times 9 times 8 = 72 possible numbers. Subtracting this from the initial total, we get the corrected total number of possible numbers: 360 - 72 = 288.

We aim to demonstrate that it is possible to connect the points with n segments, each segment connecting a red point to a blue point, such that no two segments intersect. To achieve this, follow these steps: 1. **Set Up and Assumptions**: Consider the set of all possible partitions where each partition includes pairs of points, one red and one blue. Importantly, we are to ensure that the sum of the lengths of the segments in the partition is the smallest possible. 2. **Consider Each Pairing**: There are finitely many ways to pair the red and blue points since we are restricted to n points of each color. Thus, among these configurations, there exists a pairing where the total length of all the segments is minimized. 3. **Minimize Total Length**: Let us denote one such minimum length configuration by {(R_1, B_1), (R_2, B_2), ..., (R_n, B_n)}. This means the sum of the lengths of the segments between these pairs is the smallest possible compared to any other configuration of pairs. 4. **Proving Non-Intersections**: - Assume, for contradiction, that two segments in this minimal sum configuration intersect. Let's say (R_i, B_i) and (R_j, B_j) intersect. - If these segments intersect, they form a convex quadrilateral because no three points are collinear. Therefore, we can redraw the diagonals of this quadrilateral. The original intersecting segments can then be replaced with the non-intersecting segments (R_i, B_j) and (R_j, B_i). 5. **Contradiction Expected**: - When segments (R_i, B_i) and (R_j, B_j) are replaced by (R_i, B_j) and (R_j, B_i), by the triangle inequality and properties of convex quadrilaterals, the combined length of (R_i, B_j) and (R_j, B_i) is strictly less than the combined length of (R_i, B_i) and (R_j, B_j). 6. **Inference from Contradiction**: - The new configuration would have a smaller total length, contradicting our initial assumption that our chosen pairing had the smallest sum of segment lengths. Since our configuration should have the smallest possible total length, it must follow that our initial assumption of having intersecting segments is wrong. Thus, in the configuration with the smallest total length, no two segments can intersect. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is indeed possible to draw n segments each connecting a red point to a blue point without any segments intersecting.

Since a and b are 6-digit numbers with all digits even, the possible digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. We are interested in maximizing b - a under the given constraints. 3. **Constructing Numbers:** - The largest 6-digit number a with all even digits: Let's start with the smallest even digit 2 at the first place (to avoid leading zero). - a = 288888 - The next step is to prove that there exists some b such that the condition holds. 4. **Finding the Maximum Difference:** Consider b. Since we want to maximize the difference b - a, b should be just above a but still all even digits. Suppose: - The smallest possible 6-digit number b above 288888 such that all its digits are even: - b = 400000 - Now, let's check the difference: [ b - a = 400000 - 288888 ] - Compute the difference step by step: [ 400000 - 288888 = 400000 - 300000 + 300000 - 288888 ] [ = 100000 + 11112 = 111112 ] 5. **Verifying Intermediate Numbers:** We need to ensure that any number between 288888 and 400000 contains at least one odd digit. Checking the interval: [ 288888 < 300000 < 400000 ] Since 300000 will have an odd digit (3) in the tens place, any number in the range of 288888 to 400000 satisfies the condition of containing at least one odd digit in between. 6. **Conclusion:** Hence, the maximum possible value of the difference b - a under the given constraints is: [ boxed{111112} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove that if (m) and (n) are natural numbers, then the expression ((5m + n + 1)(3m n + 4)) is always divisible by 2.","completion":": We are given that (m) and (n) are natural numbers. We need to prove that the product ((5m + n + 1)(3m - n + 4)) is always even. 1. **Determine the parity of (5m + n + 1) and (3m - n + 4):** To begin, we consider the expressions (5m + n + 1) and (3m - n + 4). We will calculate their difference to understand their parities. 2. **Calculate the difference of the expressions:** [ (5m + n + 1) - (3m - n + 4) ] By expanding and simplifying this expression: [ = 5m + n + 1 - 3m + n - 4 ] [ = (5m - 3m) + (n + n) + (1 - 4) ] [ = 2m + 2n - 3 ] 3. **Analyze the parity of the difference:** [ (2m + 2n - 3) ] Since (m) and (n) are natural numbers, (2m) and (2n) are even numbers. The addition of even numbers (2m) and (2n) results in an even number (2m + 2n). Subtracting 3 (an odd number) from an even number (2m + 2n) results in an odd number. Therefore, (2m + 2n - 3) is an odd number. 4. **Determine the parities of individual terms:** Since the difference of (5m + n + 1) and (3m - n + 4) is odd, one of these terms must be even and the other must be odd. An odd number minus an even number (or vice versa) produces an odd result. Hence, neither both numbers can be odd nor can both be even. One must be even and the other must be odd. 5. **Conclude that their product is even:** The product of an even number and an odd number is always even. Therefore, the product ((5m + n + 1)(3m - n + 4)) is always even. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Let (a_{i}, b_{i} > 0) for (i = 1, 2, cdots, n).

Since tanalpha is a real root of 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0 and alpha is an angle in the third quadrant, we can solve the quadratic equation to find the values of tanalpha. The equation can be factored as (2x + 1)(x - 1) = 0, giving the roots x = -frac{1}{2} and x = 1. However, since alpha is in the third quadrant, tanalpha must be positive, so we discard the root -frac{1}{2} and take tanalpha = 1.

Observing the original expression, because alpha is in the third quadrant, both sinalpha and cosalpha are negative. Thus, 2sinalpha - cosalpha and sinalpha + cosalpha both yield negative values, and their division must be defined. The mistake lies in our assumption that tanalpha = 1 for alpha in the third quadrant, which is incorrect given the negative values of sine and cosine. The correct process is to use the trigonometric identities where tanalpha = frac{sinalpha}{cosalpha}: begin{align*} frac{2sinalpha - cosalpha}{sinalpha + cosalpha} &= frac{2frac{sin^2alpha}{cosalpha} - cosalpha}{frac{sin^2alpha}{cosalpha} + cosalpha} quad text{(since tanalpha = frac{sinalpha}{cosalpha})} &= frac{2tanalpha - 1}{tanalpha + 1} &= frac{2(-frac{1}{2}) - 1}{(-frac{1}{2}) + 1} &= frac{-2 - 1}{frac{1}{2}} &= frac{-3}{frac{1}{2}} &= -6. end{align*} Therefore, boxed{frac{2sinalpha - cosalpha}{sinalpha + cosalpha} = -6}. 2.

To understand how the points accumulate, we first notice that: [ 72 + 84 = 156 ] 4. Observing that there are 13 rotations, let's calculate their average points combined: [ frac{156}{13} = 12 ] This means on average, players 5 and 9 together score 12 points per rotation. 5. Let's analyze the possible sums of points for two players in adjacent sectors summing to 12: - (8 + 4) - (7 + 5) - (6 + 6) (not possible since they cannot be at the same position) Therefore, the sectors totaling to 12 point combinations for players 5 and 9 would logically be combinations of 8, 4, 7, and 5. 6.

Therefore, Delta(boldsymbol{A}-boldsymbol{B}) must resolve to 1 - 0 = 1. 4. **Possible Contributions to Change**: - Each type of movement can be counted as follows: begin{itemize} item a times for Delta(boldsymbol{A} - boldsymbol{B}) = 0 item b times for Delta(boldsymbol{A} - boldsymbol{B}) = 3 item c times for Delta(boldsymbol{A} - boldsymbol{B}) = 3omega item d times for Delta(boldsymbol{A} - boldsymbol{B}) = 3omega^2 item e times for Delta(boldsymbol{A} - boldsymbol{B}) = sqrt{3}i item f times for Delta(boldsymbol{A} - boldsymbol{B}) = sqrt{3}iomega item g times for Delta(boldsymbol{A} - boldsymbol{B}) = sqrt{3}iomega^2 end{itemize} - Then, the net change must be: [ 0a + 3b + 3omega c + 3omega^2 d + sqrt{3}i e + sqrt{3}iomega f + sqrt{3}iomega^2 g = 1 ] 5. **Inconsistency in Solution**: - When considering the imaginary parts and the magnitude coefficients: [ frac{3}{2}c - frac{3}{2}d - 3b - frac{3}{2}f - frac{3}{2}g = 2 ] - Multiplying both sides of this equation by 2 gives us: [ 3c - 3d - 6b - 3f - 3g = 4 ] - The left side is a multiple of 3, whereas the right side is 4, which cannot be true, leading to a contradiction. 6. **Conclusion**: - Thus, it is impossible for boldsymbol{A} = 0, boldsymbol{B}=1 to be transformed into boldsymbol{A}=1, boldsymbol{B}=0 within any finite number of jumps as prescribed by the rules.

Given this definition, when we are asked to find the arithmetic square root of 7, we are looking for the positive square root of 7. Therefore, among the given options: - A: sqrt{7} is the correct representation of the arithmetic square root of 7. - B: -sqrt{7} represents the negative square root, which is not what the arithmetic square root refers to. - C: ±sqrt{7} includes both the positive and negative square roots, which is more than what the arithmetic square root specifies. - D: sqrt[3]{7} represents the cube root of 7, which is not relevant to the concept of the arithmetic square root.

Here, ( t ) is the time index and ( f(t) = t + j(t) ) represents the time when the ball thrown at time ( t ) lands, given that ( j(t) ) is the number of beats in the future when the ball is to be caught. 2. **Drawing Curves in the Interval:** We only draw the curves whose left endpoint (throw) lies in the interval ([0, M n - 1]), where ( M ) is an integer multiplier and ( n ) is the length of the sequence. 3. **Sum of Lengths for a Single Ball:** For every single ball, the sum of the lengths of the curves (arrows) corresponding to that ball falls into the interval ([M n - J, M n + J]), where ( J = max {j(0), j(1), ldots, j(n-1)}). This construction ensures that each ball travels through these curves summed over all intervals of length ( n ). 4. **Total Sum of Lengths:** Therefore, the total sum of the lengths of the curves drawn lies between: [ b(M n - J) quad text{and} quad b(M n + J). ] Since the arrow drawn at time ( t ) has length ( j(bar{t}) ), the sum of the lengths of all such arrows for the sequence is: [ M(j(0) + j(1) + cdots + j(n-1)). ] 5. **Establishing the Inequality:** This yields the inequality: [ b(M n - J) leq M(j(0) + j(1) + cdots + j(n-1)) leq b(M n + J). ] 6. **Dividing by ( M n ):** We divide the entire inequality by ( M n ) to normalize it: [ bleft(1 - frac{J}{n M}right) leq frac{j(0) + j(1) + cdots + j(n-1)}{n} leq bleft(1 + frac{J}{n M}right). ] 7. **Taking ( M ) Arbitrarily Large:** Since we can choose ( M ) to be arbitrarily large, the terms ( frac{J}{n M} ) diminish towards zero.

Therefore, the profit function is: f(x)=R-C=(25x-frac{1}{8}x^2)-(100+4x)=-frac{1}{8}x^2 + 21x - 100. According to the constraints left{ begin{array}{l} x geq 0, 25 - frac{1}{8}x > 0, end{array} right. we get the domain of 0 leq x < 200.

Find the total number of different arrangements possible. (Answer with a number).","completion":"To solve this problem, we can consider the two Beijing representatives as a single unit since they must stand next to each other. Therefore, we have 7 units in total to arrange: the Beijing unit, two representatives from Shanghai, two from Tianjin, and two from Chongqing. First, we arrange the 7 units, which can be done in 6! ways because we treat the Beijing unit as one. Then, we have to arrange the two Beijing representatives within their unit, which can be done in 2! ways. Next, we need to consider the restriction for the Chongqing representatives. To calculate the number of arrangements where the Chongqing representatives are not next to each other, we subtract the arrangements where they are next to each other from the total arrangements without restrictions. Without the restriction, the two Chongqing representatives can be considered as a single unit, similar to the Beijing representatives. Therefore, we have 6 units to arrange (the Beijing unit, the Chongqing unit, two representatives from Shanghai, and two from Tianjin), which can be done in 5! ways. Within the Chongqing unit, there are 2! ways to arrange the two representatives. So, the number of arrangements where the Chongqing representatives are next to each other is 5! times 2!.

The vertex (V) is the midpoint between (F) (focus) and (d) (directrix). - Let (X) be the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to (d) (directrix). - Let (O) be the midpoint of the segment (overline{FA}). - Let (B) be the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to the line (ell). - Let (M) be the midpoint of the segment (overline{BV}), which is the foot of the perpendicular from (O) to the line (ell). 2. **Utilize properties of the parabola:** - Since point (A) lies on the parabola, by definition, the distance from (A) to the focus (F) is equal to the distance from (A) to the directrix (d): [ AX = AF. ] 3. **Establish distances involving the directrix (d) and line (ell):** - From the vertical distances, (XB) (distance from (X) to (ell)) is equal to the distance from the focus (F) to the vertex (V), noted as (FV). - Combining the distances and properties: [ AB + XB = AX. ] Substituting (AX = AF) and (XB = FV): [ AB + FV = AF. ] 4. **Connect midpoint (M) to the overall setup:** - The segment (OM) is the average of distances (FV) and (AB): [ OM = frac{FV + AB}{2}. ] - From the substitution (AB + FV = AF): [ OM = frac{AF}{2}. ] 5. **Result and Conclusion:** - Thus, the radius of the circle with diameter (AF) is (frac{AF}{2}). - The circle with diameter (AF) is centered at (O) and by construction, has radius (OM).

The relative speed is the difference in speed between the two trains since they are moving in the same direction. The speeds need to be converted to meters per second (m/s) because we want the length in meters and the time is given in seconds. Speed of the faster train = 108 kmph Speed of the slower train = 36 kmph To convert kmph to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hour): Speed of the faster train in m/s = 108 * (1000 / 3600) = 30 m/s Speed of the slower train in m/s = 36 * (1000 / 3600) = 10 m/s Relative speed = Speed of the faster train - Speed of the slower train Relative speed = 30 m/s - 10 m/s = 20 m/s Now, we know the relative speed and the time it takes for the faster train to overtake the slower train: Time = 17 seconds The distance covered by the faster train while overtaking (which is the length of the faster train) is: Distance = Relative speed * Time Distance = 20 m/s * 17 s = 340 meters Therefore, the length of the faster train is boxed{340} meters."},{"prompt":"Given a right triangle ABC with side lengths a, b, and c (a<b<c), determine whether the condition a:b:c=3:4:5 is a sufficient and/or necessary condition for a, b, c form an arithmetic progression.

If a=3k, b=4k, and c=5k (k>0), then clearly a, b, and c are in arithmetic progression because the difference between each pair of consecutive terms is constant, namely k. Therefore, \\"a:b:c=3:4:5\\" implies \\"a, b, c form an arithmetic progression\\". Now let's consider the condition \\"a, b, c form an arithmetic progression\\". In a right triangle with side lengths a, b, and c (a<b<c), if a, b, and c form an arithmetic sequence, then by the properties of an arithmetic progression, 2b=a+c. By the Pythagorean theorem, a^2+b^2=c^2. Combining the two, we have: 2b^2=(a+c)^2 Expanding the right side yields: 2b^2=a^2+2ac+c^2 Since a^2+b^2=c^2, we can rewrite the equation as: 2b^2=2a^2+2b^2 Dividing both sides by 2 and subtracting b^2 from both sides, we get: 0=a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b) Because a+b>0, we must have a-b=0, which contradicts the definition of a progression where a, b, and c are distinct positive numbers. Thus, our original assumption that a, b, and c are in arithmetic progression must be incorrect, meaning that if we define arithmetic progression as having a common non-zero difference, then \\"a, b, c form an arithmetic progression\\" is not true, and therefore it does not imply \\"a:b:c=3:4:5\\".

This method is efficient if done systematically to save work compared to random selection. To identify the numbers: - We will break the number into the sum of its hundreds digit and a two-digit number with equal digits. - The remainders of these parts when divided by 7, either must both be 0, or their sum must be 7. (e.g., for (322 = 7 cdot 46), 300 has a remainder of 6 and 22 has a remainder of 1). Let's compile numbers with equal digits and their division remainders: - **Remainder 0:** (00, 77), **Hundreds digit remainder 0**: 700.

Show that there are infinitely many fractions (frac{p}{q}) such that [ left| x frac{p}{q} right| < frac{1}{q^{2}} ]","completion":"1. **Fixing Parameters and Initial Definitions**: Let's fix a positive integer n in mathbb{N}^{*} and consider the decimal parts of the numbers ix for i in {0, 1, 2, ldots, n}. Denote these decimal parts as a_i, expressed as: [ a_{i} = i x - lfloor i x rfloor ] where lfloor cdot rfloor denotes the floor function. 2. **Properties of Decimal Parts (a_i)**: Each a_i for i in {0, 1, ldots, n} lies within the interval (0, 1) since x is irrational and hence i x cannot be an integer. Thus, we have: [ 0 < a_i < 1 ] 3. **Dividing the Interval**: Now, we divide the interval [0, 1] into n subintervals I_k = left[frac{k-1}{n}, frac{k}{n}right) for k in {1, 2, ldots, n}. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**: According to the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two of the a_i values falling into the same subinterval I_k since there are n+1 decimal parts a_i but only n subintervals. Thus, there exist indices i and j with i neq j such that both a_i and a_j are in the same subinterval I_k. 5. **Constructing Fraction**: By letting q = |i-j|, we construct the fraction frac{p}{q} where p = lfloor q x rfloor. This setup ensures that q is a positive integer. 6. **Evaluating the Approximation**: Since a_i and a_j are within the same subinterval, the difference |a_i - a_j| is less than the length of the subinterval: [ |a_i - a_j| < frac{1}{n} ] 7. **Bounding the Approximation Error**: Now, we evaluate the approximation error |x - frac{p}{q}|. Using the definition of a_i and the fact that q x = ix - jx: [ q x = (i-j)x implies q x = ix - jx + (lfloor j x rfloor - lfloor i x rfloor) = n + m - (m+n) = 0 ] We now approximate the rational part and rewrite as [ p = lfloor q x rfloor ] This gives [ |x - frac{p}{q}| = frac{1}{q} |q x - p| ] 8. **Simplifying the Bound**: Using the fact that the decimal parts' difference is smaller than frac{1}{n} and substituting: [ |x - frac{p}{q}| < frac{1}{q} cdot frac{1}{n} = frac{1}{qn} ] 9. **Conclusion**: Since we can choose n as large as we like, we can make frac{1}{n} arbitrarily small. More importantly, we notice the bound: [ left|x - frac{p}{q}right| < frac{1}{q^2} ] This indicates that for any large q, there exist fractions frac{p}{q} such that the given inequality holds, guaranteeing infinitely many such fractions. Therefore, we conclude: [ boxed{left| x - frac{p}{q} right| < frac{1}{q^2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Will bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy, 5 boxes of mint candy, and 4 boxes of caramel candy.

Henry starts by walking 9 meters due north from a tree. 2. He then turns due east and walks 24 feet. 3. After that, he turns due south and walks a distance that is the sum of 9 meters and 32 feet. Since we are dealing with both meters and feet, it's important to note that 1 meter = 3.28084 feet approximately. However, in this problem, the 9 meters walked due north are exactly canceled out by the 9 meters walked due south, so we don't need to convert them to feet for the purpose of calculating the horizontal distance from the starting point. Thus, Henry's movements east and south form the two legs of a right triangle, with the distances being: - 24 feet to the east, - 32 feet to the south.

Therefore, |AF| = 3m. Since the line l passes through the origin O and intersects the ellipse at points A and B, and given that AF perp BF, we can deduce that O is the midpoint of both line segments FF' (where F' is the left focus) and AB. This implies |AF'| = |BF| = m. 2. **Express the Sum of Distances from the Foci to a Point on the Ellipse**: For any point on an ellipse, the sum of the distances from the two foci to that point is constant and equal to the major axis length, 2a. Thus, we have |AF'| + |AF| = 2a. 3. **Substitute the Known Values**: Substituting the values of |AF'| = m and |AF| = 3m into the equation, we get m + 3m = 2a, which simplifies to 4m = 2a. Therefore, m = frac{1}{2}a. 4. **Determine the Lengths of AF and AF'**: From m = frac{1}{2}a, we find that |AF| = 3m = frac{3}{2}a and |AF'| = m = frac{1}{2}a. 5. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**: Since AF perp AF', we can form a right triangle AFF', where FF' is the hypotenuse. The length of FF' is 2c (where c is the distance from the center to a focus). Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we have (frac{1}{2}a)^2 + (frac{3}{2}a)^2 = (2c)^2. 6. **Solve for c^2/a^2**: Simplifying the equation, we get frac{1}{4}a^2 + frac{9}{4}a^2 = 4c^2, which simplifies further to frac{10}{4}a^2 = 4c^2.

Substituting (c = 1/3) back into the formula, we get: [ cos(nx) = frac{P_n(1/3)}{3^n} ] If (cos(nx) = pm 1), then: [ pm 1 = frac{P_n(1/3)}{3^n} ] 5. **Represent (frac{P_n(1/3)}{3^n}) in irreducible form:** To (frac{P_n(1/3)}{3^n}) be an integer, that means (P_n(1/3)) should be (pm 3^n): [ P_n(1/3) = 3^n cdot (pm 1) ] However, since (P_n(x)) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, (P_n(1/3)) cannot equal (pm 3^n), because (3^n) multiplied by a term with (1/3) in it will not produce an integer unless (1/3) term is canceled, which can't be due to structure of polynomial. 6. **Proof by contradiction lead to the conclusion:** Hence, (cos(nx) neq pm 1). This results in our initial assumption being false. Therefore, (frac{cos^{-1}(1/3)}{pi}) cannot be rational.

We need to find the angle (angle DSC). 1. **Determine (angle BAS):** Since (ABS) is an equilateral triangle, all its angles measure (60^circ). Therefore: [ angle BAS = 60^circ ] 2. **Determine (angle SAD):** In the square (ABCD), (angle BAD = 90^circ). Thus, [ angle SAD = angle BAD - angle BAS = 90^circ - 60^circ = 30^circ ] 3. **Establish (AS = AD):** Since (triangle ABS) is equilateral, all its sides are of equal length: [ AS = AB ] Also, since (AB = AD) (both being sides of the square), [ AS = AD ] Therefore, (triangle SAD) is isosceles with (SA = AD). 4. **Find (angle ADS):** Let (angle ADS = x). Since the sum of the angles in (triangle SAD) is (180^circ), [ 30^circ + x + x = 180^circ ] Solving for (x): [ 2x = 150^circ implies x = 75^circ ] Therefore: [ angle ADS = 75^circ ] 5. **Establish (angle BSC):** By the same reasoning as used for (triangle SAD), we can establish that (triangle BSC) is also isosceles and angles follow the same calculations. Thus: [ angle BSC = 75^circ ] 6. **Calculate (angle DSC):** The sum of the angles around point (S) should be (360^circ).

We need to arrange these integers such that each value is either strictly bigger than all the preceding values or strictly smaller than all the preceding values. 2. Let the permutation start with the integer (k). This means (k) is the first element in the sequence. 3. The integers (1, 2, ldots, k-1) must appear in the sequence in strictly decreasing order after (k). This is because if any of these integers appeared in any other order, it would violate the condition that each value is either strictly bigger or strictly smaller than all preceding values. 4. Similarly, the integers (k+1, k+2, ldots, n) must appear in strictly increasing order after (k). This ensures that the condition is maintained for all values greater than (k). 5. For each (k), there are (binom{n-1}{k-1}) ways to choose (k-1) slots for the numbers smaller than (k). This is because we are choosing (k-1) positions out of (n-1) available positions (excluding the position of (k)). 6. Summing across all values of (k) from (1) to (n), we get the total number of ways to arrange the sequence. This sum can be expressed as: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} binom{n-1}{k-1} ] 7. Using the binomial theorem, we know that: [ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} binom{n-1}{k} = 2^{n-1} ] Since (binom{n-1}{k-1}) is just a shift of the binomial coefficients, the sum from (k=1) to (n) is equivalent to the sum from (k=0) to (n-1). 8.

For our problem, n = 8 since we are dealing with sequences of length 8. 2. **Define Fort Sympathique Sequence Set**: Let F_n represent the set of fort sympathique sequences of length n. We aim to find the cardinality of F_8. 3. **Constructing a Bijection**: We will construct a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the sets mathfrak{S}_{n} and F_{n}. 4. **Forward Mapping**: Given a permutation sigma in mathfrak{S}_{n}, we construct a fort sympathique sequence a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} using the following rules: - Start with a_{sigma(1)} = 1. - For j geq 1, if a_{sigma(j)} = i and sigma(j+1) < sigma(j), then set a_{sigma(j+1)} = i. - Otherwise, set a_{sigma(j+1)} = i + 1. This ensures that the sequence a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n satisfies the fort sympathique conditions: - For every integer k geq 2 that appears in the sequence, k-1 must also appear and its first occurrence must be before the last occurrence of k. 5. **Reverse Mapping**: Given a fort sympathique sequence a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, we can determine a permutation as follows: - Identify positions (indices) of the integers in descending order starting from 1, then 2, up to n, and arrange these positions in descending order. - This list of indices gives us a unique permutation sigma in mathfrak{S}_{n}. 6. **Verification**: - Verify the forward mapping constructs a valid fort sympathique sequence. - Verify the reverse mapping reconstructs the original permutation.

So, the total distance to be covered for them to be clear of each other is: Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 250 meters + 350 meters Total distance = 600 meters Now, we need to calculate the relative speed at which they are moving apart.

We need to prove that: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} |S B_{2i-1}| = sum_{i=1}^{n} |S B_{2i}|. ] 1. **Initial Condition:** Since S A_{1} = S A_{2} = cdots = S A_{2n}, we have the equal length condition for all the edges from S to the base vertices. 2. **Equality Relation:** We set up the following equality relation based on the given conditions: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} left| S B_{2i-1} right| = sum_{i=1}^{n} left| S B_{2i} right|. ] 3. **Transformation Using Sphere and Prism Properties:** Consider the sphere Omega with center O and radius R passing through S. By using the intercept theorem (or similar triangles), we can express: [ left| S B_{i} right| = frac{R}{left| S A_{i} right|} left| A_{i} B_{i} right|. ] Given left| S A_{i} right| is constant, this simplifies our equation to: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} left| A_{2i-1} B_{2i-1} right| = sum_{i=1}^{n} left| A_{2i} B_{2i} right|, ] 4. **Simplification by Using the Distance to the Sphere's Center:** Using the fact that B_{i} lies on the sphere Omega, we get: [ left| A_{i} B_{i} right| = sqrt{ | A_i O |^2 - R^2 }. ] Thus, the equation further transforms to: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} left( | A_{2i-1} O |^2 - R^2 right) = sum_{i=1}^{n} left( | A_{2i} O |^2 - R^2 right). ] 5. **Cancellation of Sphere Radius:** Since -R^2 is constant and cancels out on both sides, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} | A_{2i-1} O |^2 = sum_{i=1}^{n} | A_{2i} O |^2. ] 6. **Using Complex Number Representation:** Let O' be the center of the regular 2n-gon on the base. Each point A_i can be represented by a 2n-th root of unity epsilon_i = e^{2pi i (i-1)/2n}. The distance terms involve: [ | A_{i} P |^2 = | epsilon_i - z |^2, ] where z represents the complex number corresponding to the orthogonal projection P of O onto the plane of the polygon.

The powers of i repeat every four terms. Thus, i^x + i^y being a real number implies that x and y must place i^x and i^y at positions in their cycle such that their sum is real. 2. **Calculating Suitable Pairs**: - **Pairs with both terms real**: If both i^x and i^y are real (i^x = 1 or -1 and i^y = 1 or -1), then x and y must be even. The positions for x and y are {2, 4, 6, ldots, 150} when divisible by 2, but we need x divisible by 3 as well. Thus, x can be from the set {6, 12, 18, ldots, 150} which are even multiples of 3, forming 25 possible values for x. Since y needs to be greater and also an even number, for each x, the values of y are {x+2, x+4, ldots, 150}. - Calculate pairs for each x: Since the range depends on x, compute the sum of a series: sum_{x=6,12,ldots,150} left( frac{150 - x}{2} right). This is equal to 25 cdot 47 / 2 = 587.5 pairs where both i^x and i^y are real.

Since 225^circ corresponds to 45^circ (as 225^circ = 180^circ + 45^circ), and the cosine of 45^circ in the first quadrant is frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, the cosine of 225^circ is the negative of this value.

Let (omega) be the circle with center ( K ) passing through ( B ). Further, let (gamma) be the Apollonian circle of ( A ) with respect to the segment ( BC ). Then, points ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) are the intersections of (omega) and (gamma). 2. **Proof of Key Lemma**: - Let ( X_1, Y_1, Z_1 ) be the projections of ( P_1 ) onto ( BC, AC, AB ) respectively. It is well known that (triangle X_1Y_1Z_1 sim triangle D_1E_1F_1) (this is a known result from the geometry of conics, specifically Lemma 2.5 from *Geometry of Conics* by A. V. Akopyan and A. A.

(blacksquare) 3. **Intersection of ( P_1P_2 ) with the Circumcircle**: - By the Key Lemma, line ( P_1P_2 ) is the radical axis of (omega) and (gamma). Since ((ABC)) is orthogonal to both (omega) and (gamma), the circumcenter ( O ) of (triangle ABC) must lie on ( P_1P_2 ). 4. **Simson Lines and Nine-Point Circle**: - Let ( H ) be the orthocenter of (triangle ABC), ( U ) be the intersection of the Simson lines of ( Q_1 ) and ( Q_2 ), and ( T ) be the reflection of ( H ) across ( U ). - Since ( Q_1 ) and ( Q_2 ) are diametrically opposite, their Simson lines are perpendicular. It is known that the Simson line of ( Q_1 ) (respectively ( Q_2 )) bisects segment ( HQ_1 ) (respectively ( HQ_2 )). - Therefore, ( TQ_1 ) and ( TQ_2 ) are parallel to the Simson lines of ( Q_1 ) and ( Q_2 ) respectively. This implies: [ angle Q_1TQ_2 = frac{pi}{2} ] - Since ( Q_1 ) and ( Q_2 ) are diametrically opposite, ( T ) lies on ((ABC)). Thus, ( U ) must lie on the nine-point circle because the homothety with ratio (frac{1}{2}) centered at ( H ) maps ((ABC)) to the nine-point circle.

This means that p worked alone for x days and then both p and q worked together for the remaining (40 - x) days. The total work done by p when he worked alone for x days is (W/80) * x. The total work done by both p and q together for the remaining (40 - x) days is (W/80 + W/48) * (40 - x). Since the total work W was completed in 40 days, we can write the equation: (W/80) * x + (W/80 + W/48) * (40 - x) = W Now, let's solve for x. First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 240 (the least common multiple of 80 and 48).

We will show that it is possible to identify both counterfeit coins in at most 13 tests. 1. **Initial Testing Phase:** - We perform the first 11 tests by placing a different pair of coins into the device each time. Specifically, we test coins (A_1) and (A_2), (A_3) and (A_4), (A_5) and (A_6), and so on, up to (A_{21}) and (A_{22}). - The possible outcomes for each test are: - **\\"0\\":** Both coins are genuine. - **\\"1\\":** One coin is genuine and the other is counterfeit. - **\\"2\\":** Both coins are counterfeit. If at any point we get the result \\"2\\", our task is complete as we have found both counterfeit coins. However, assume we never get \\"2\\" in these 11 tests. 2. **Handling the Outcome of \\"1\\":** - If during these first 11 tests we get the result \\"1\\" twice, it implies we have identified two pairs, say ((A_i, B_i)) and ((A_j, B_j)) with one counterfeit coin each. - Select one of these pairs, say ((A_i, B_i)), and test coin (A_i) against another known genuine coin, say (A_1). If the result is \\"1\\", (A_i) is counterfeit, and (B_i) is genuine. If the result is \\"0\\", (A_i) is genuine, and (B_i) is counterfeit. 3. **Narrowing Down from Mixed Results:** - If we only got \\"1\\" once, i.e., in the test of coins (A_i) and (B_i), we know one of these is counterfeit, and one genuine. - Test coins (A_i) and (C_i), where (C_i) is from the remaining coins not yet tested. If we get: - \\"1\\": (A_i) is the counterfeit and it reveals (C_i) is either genuine or counterfeit based on further tests. - \\"0\\": (B_i) is counterfeit confirming both (A_i) and (B_i). 4. **The Remaining Coins:** - If all the initial 11 tests returned \\"0\\", then all coins tested are genuine. This means the two counterfeit coins are among the last three coins not tested yet, labeled (C, D,) and (E). - Conduct the 12th test on coins (C) and (D): - If the result is \\"0\\", then (E) must be tested against a genuine coin to confirm (E) is counterfeit. - If the result is \\"1\\", one is genuine, and one is counterfeit, confirming the remaining coin (E) is the second counterfeit coin. - Carry out the 13th test to distinguish between (C) and (D) if needed depending on context derived from previous tests. Conclusion: By carefully following the steps and using no more than the allowed maximum of 13 tests, we can definitively identify the two counterfeit coins.

We can express this as: [ text{Area}(BCDK) = frac{1}{2} text{Area}(ABCD) ] 3. **Area of Quadrilateral (CDKL):** - Next, consider quadrilateral (CDKL).

Since the dice are 12-sided with numbers from 1 to 12, there are 9 one-digit numbers (1 through 9) and 3 two-digit numbers (10 through 12). - The probability of rolling a one-digit number on a single die is the number of one-digit outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is frac{9}{12} = frac{3}{4}. - Similarly, the probability of rolling a two-digit number on a single die is the number of two-digit outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes, which is frac{3}{12} = frac{1}{4}. We are interested in the scenario where two dice show one-digit numbers and two dice show two-digit numbers. The probability of this specific outcome for any two particular dice can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each event happening: - The probability of two specific dice showing two-digit numbers is left(frac{1}{4}right)^2 = frac{1}{16}. - The probability of the other two dice showing one-digit numbers is left(frac{3}{4}right)^2 = frac{9}{16}. Multiplying these probabilities together gives the probability of this outcome for two specific dice: frac{1}{16} times frac{9}{16} = frac{9}{256}. However, any two of the four dice could be the ones showing the two-digit numbers. The number of ways to choose which two dice show one-digit numbers (and thus the other two show two-digit numbers) is given by the binomial coefficient binom{4}{2}, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 items out of 4, and is calculated as: - binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6. Therefore, to find the total probability of having two dice show one-digit numbers and two dice show two-digit numbers, we multiply the probability of the event for a specific set of two dice by the number of ways to choose such sets of two dice: - Total probability = 6 times frac{9}{256} = frac{54}{256}. Finally, simplifying this fraction to its lowest terms: - frac{54}{256} = frac{27}{128}.

When n = k + 1, (S_{k+1} - 1)^2 = a_{k+1}S_{k+1}, which is equivalent to (S_k + a_{k+1} - 1)^2 = a_{k+1}(S_k + a_{k+1}). It follows that (a_{k+1} - frac{1}{k+1})^2 = a_{k+1}(frac{k}{k+1} + a_{k+1}), which gives a_{k+1}^2 - frac{2}{k+1}a_{k+1} + frac{1}{(k+1)^2} = frac{k}{k+1}a_{k+1} + a_{k+1}^2.

We are asked whether it is possible to color 25 cells such that each cell has an odd number of colored neighbors. In such a case, any cell with an odd number of colored neighbors would contribute to ( n_1 ) or ( n_3 ). 6. Therefore, ( n_1 + n_3 ) must be odd (since a single cell with an odd number of neighbors must have an odd sum of cells contributing to ( n_1 ) and ( n_3 )). 7. But from the previous step, we proved that ( n_1 + n_3 ) must be even, which contradicts the condition that each of the 25 cells (an odd number) has an odd number of colored neighbors. Therefore, it is impossible to color 25 cells such that each has an odd number of colored neighbors.

Consider the expression (sqrt{a+bi}=x+yi), where (a) and (b) are real numbers, and (x) and (y) are the real and imaginary components of the square root, respectively. 2. Squaring both sides of the expression yields: [ (x+yi)^2 = a+bi ] 3. Expanding the left-hand side: [ x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 = a + bi ] 4. Separating the real and imaginary parts, we get two equations: [ x^2 - y^2 = a quad text{and} quad 2xy = b ] Since (b) is the coefficient of the imaginary part, to solve for (x) and (y), we analyze these equations: 5. Given (b neq 0), solve for (y) from the second equation: [ y = frac{b}{2x} ] 6. Substitute (y = frac{b}{2x}) into the first equation: [ x^2 - left(frac{b}{2x}right)^2 = a ] [ x^2 - frac{b^2}{4x^2} = a ] 7.

Notice that if (a = 0) (pure imaginary number), the solution simplifies dramatically: [ x^2 = frac{sqrt{b^2}}{2} = frac{b^2}{2} ] Therefore, the square root of (a+bi) (with a properly chosen principal value) results in (x+yi) being imaginary if (a=0) and non-zero values for (b). Therefore, the square root of a purely imaginary number is still imaginary since (x=0) in such cases. Conclusively, the initial statement is proven true.

Assume r + s and rs are integers, and both are divisible by k. We need to show that for any natural number m, r^m + s^m is an integer and divisible by k. Let us set r + s = kp and rs = kq, where k in mathbb{N} and p, q in mathbb{Z}. 2. Calculating r^2 + s^2: [ begin{aligned} r^2 + s^2 &= (r+s)^2 - 2rs &= (kp)^2 - 2kq &= k^2p^2 - 2kq end{aligned} ] Clearly, r^2 + s^2 is an integer and divisible by k. 3. Therefore, the conclusion holds for m = 1 and m = 2. 4. Assume for a natural number m, this conclusion holds. That is r+s, r^2+s^2, cdots, r^{m-1} + s^{m-1} are all integers and divisible by k. 5. Consider: [ r^m + s^m = (r+s)(r^{m-1} + s^{m-1}) - rs(r^{m-2} + s^{m-2}) ] Since r+s and rs are divisible by k, and r^{m-1} + s^{m-1} and r^{m-2} + s^{m-2} are divisible by k by the induction hypothesis, r^m + s^m is also an integer and divisible by k. 6. We have thus shown, by induction, that for all natural numbers m, r^m + s^m is an integer and divisible by k. 7. Now, let's prove the existence of such r and s, where r is irrational, 0 < s < 1, and both r+s and rs are integers divisible by k. Consider the quadratic equation: [ x^2 - kpx + kq = 0 ] 8. If r and s exist, and 0 < s < 1, then we must have: [ left{ begin{array}{l} Delta = k^2p^2 - 4kq > 0, 0 < frac{kp - sqrt{k^2p^2 - 4kq}}{2} < 1 end{array} right. ] Which translates to: [ left{ begin{array}{l} p^2 > frac{4q}{k}, p > q > 0 end{array} right. ] 9. Clearly, integers p, q satisfying these conditions exist. Hence, such r and s exist. 10. To make r irrational, we require k^2p^2 - 4kq is not a perfect square. Let q = k. Then: [ begin{aligned} Delta &= k^2p^2 - 4kq &= k^2(p^2 - 4) end{aligned} ] Since p > q, p^2 > 4. Clearly, p^2 - 4 is not a perfect square; otherwise: [ begin{array}{c} p^2 - 4 = u^2, (p+u)(p-u) = 4, end{array} ] which is impossible. 11. Therefore, for any natural number k, we can choose q = k and p satisfying condition (1). There exist r and s such that r+s and rs are integers, both divisible by k, and r is irrational, and 0 < s < 1.

The key to solving this problem is using the formula for the distance from a point to a line. Since the circumference of the circle is bisected by a line, the line passes through the circle's center. By finding the value of D, and using the relationship between the line and the circle, we can draw a conclusion. Step 1: Find the center of the circle and the value of D. Since the circumference of circle C: x^{2}+y^{2}+Dx-6y+1=0 is bisected by the line x-y+4=0, the center of the circle Cleft(-dfrac{D}{2}, 3right) lies on the line x-y+4=0. Thus, we have - dfrac{D}{2} - 3 + 4 = 0, which gives D=2. So, the equation of circle C becomes x^{2}+y^{2}+2x-6y+1=0. Step 2: Rewrite the circle equation in standard form and find its radius. Rewriting the equation of circle C in standard form, we get (x+1)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=9. Thus, the center is (-1,3) and the radius r=3. Step 3: Use the distance formula between a point and a line to find the possible values of c. Since there is exactly one point on circle C that has a distance of 1 to line l: 3x+4y+c=0, the distance d between the center of the circle C and line l is d=1+3=4. Using the formula for the distance between a point (x_1, y_1) and a line Ax+By+C=0, which is d=dfrac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}, we have: dfrac{|-3+12+c|}{5}=dfrac{|c+9|}{5}=4.

We will prove this statement indirectly by assuming the contrary, i.e., there exists such a sequence of moves. 1. **Parity Argument:** - Note that in each move, we reverse the orientation of an even number of cards (two cards), so the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cards showing their back side does not change. - Initially, every card is showing its back side, which means the number of cards showing their back side is even (specifically, it is ( n )). - At the end, we want all cards to show their front side, meaning the number of cards showing their back side would be zero, which is also even. - Therefore, the number of cards showing their back side remains even throughout all the moves. 2. **Coloring Argument:** - To further validate our proof, let's color the positions on the circle alternately black and white, such that any two consecutive positions have different colors. - According to the swap rule: - When a card is flipped, it moves to a position of the opposite color. - When a card is not flipped, it moves to a position of the same color. - This implies that if a card is to return to its original position, the color of its position must match its initial color after an even number of flips, ensuring that the card has returned to the same color and not the opposite. 3. **Conclusion:** - For any card to be at its original position with its front side visible, it would need an odd number of reversals since it started with its back side visible. - However, since the number of total reversals for every single move is even, no card can end up with its front side visible if it were to return to its original position via these prescribed moves. - Hence, there is a contradiction with our assumption that such a sequence of moves exists. Therefore, we have proven that it is not possible for every card to return to its original position with its front side visible. This completes the proof.

The number of true propositions is () A: 4 B: 3 C: 2 D: 1","completion":"To evaluate the truth of each proposition, we proceed as follows: 1. **Proposition ①: A polygon with equal sides is a regular polygon.** - A regular polygon is defined as a polygon with all sides and angles equal. Therefore, having equal sides alone does not guarantee that the angles are also equal. For example, a rhombus has equal sides but does not necessarily have equal angles unless it is a square. Hence, proposition ① is false. 2. **Proposition ②: A regular polygon is a centrally symmetric figure.** - Central symmetry means that a figure is invariant under a rotation of 180 degrees about a central point. While this is true for some regular polygons like squares and regular hexagons, it is not true for all. Specifically, regular triangles (equilateral triangles) and regular pentagons do not possess central symmetry. Therefore, proposition ② is false. 3. **Proposition ③: The radius of the circumscribed circle of a regular hexagon is equal to the side length.** - In a regular hexagon, if we draw a radius from the center to any vertex and then draw a line segment from that vertex to the next, we form an equilateral triangle. This is because all angles in a regular hexagon are 120 degrees, and the segments (radius and side) are equal. Thus, the radius of the circumscribed circle is indeed equal to the side length of the hexagon, making proposition ③ true. 4. **Proposition ④: A regular n-gon has n axes of symmetry.** - A regular n-gon, by definition, is symmetric about a line through its center and any of its vertices. Since there are n vertices, there are n such lines, each being an axis of symmetry. Therefore, proposition ④ is true.

The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle is: C = π * d where d is the diameter of the circle and π (pi) is a constant approximately equal to 3.14159. Given that the diameter (d) of the circular field is 20 meters, we can calculate the circumference as follows: C = π * 20 m C ≈ 3.14159 * 20 m C ≈ 62.8318 m Now, we know the cost of fencing per meter is Rs. 1.50. To find the total cost of fencing (T), we multiply the circumference by the cost per meter: T = C * cost per meter T ≈ 62.8318 m * Rs. 1.50/m T ≈ Rs. 94.2477 Since we generally round off the cost to the nearest whole number, the total cost of fencing would be approximately Rs. boxed{94.25} ."},{"prompt":"Two identical disks are mounted on the same axis.

This means that for every rotation, there exists at least one pair of identical numbers standing opposite each other. 2. **Total Rotations and Pair Matches:** There are a total of 20 possible rotational positions (0 through 19). If for each rotation exactly one pair of identical numbers is standing opposite each other, then there will be exactly 20 pairs of identical numbers over all rotations. 3. **Contradiction by Double Matching:** If there were any rotation where more than one pair of identical numbers matched, then in fewer than 20 rotations, all pairs would be tested. Since there are only 20 numbers, a double match would contradict the constraint that exactly one pair matches in each rotation, suggesting a surplus in the number of checks required, implying that 21 numbers are needed, which is not the case because we only have 20 numbers. 4. **Mathematical Representation:** Let a_i be the number on the first disk at position i. Let b_i be the number on the second disk at position i when i = 0..19 represents the rotated positions of the disks. We will consider the differences i - b_i modulo 20 for each i. 5. **Modulo and Summation Analysis:** In a valid arrangement, the set of sums {i - b_i (text{mod} 20) }_{i=1}^{20} must cover all residues from 0 to 19 exactly once. Thus: (1 - a_1) + (2 - a_2) + ldots + (20 - a_{20}) equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + 19 = 10 cdot 19 = 190 (text{mod} 20) But 190 (text{mod} 20) = 10 notequiv 0 (text{mod} 20), leading to a contradiction since the sum equals zero, considering each pair balances to zero.

The true discount (TD) is the difference between the face value (FV) of the bill and the present worth (P). The banker's discount (BD) is calculated on the face value (FV) using simple interest for the time period until the bill is due. Given: Present Worth (P) = Rs. 400 True Discount (TD) = Rs. 20 First, we need to find the face value (FV) of the bill: FV = P + TD FV = Rs. 400 + Rs. 20 FV = Rs. 420 Now, we can calculate the banker's discount (BD) using the formula for simple interest: BD = (FV * Rate * Time) / 100 However, we do not have the rate or the time given in the problem.

The true discount (TD) is the simple interest on the present worth (P), and the banker's discount (BD) is the simple interest on the face value (FV) for the same time period and at the same rate. Since the true discount is the interest on the present worth, and the banker's discount is the interest on the face value, we can say that the banker's discount is to the true discount as the face value is to the present worth: BD / TD = FV / P Now we can solve for BD: BD = (TD * FV) / P BD = (Rs. 20 * Rs. 420) / Rs. 400 BD = Rs. 8400 / Rs. 400 BD = Rs. 21 So, the banker's discount is Rs. boxed{21} ."},{"prompt":"Find the percentage by which a number is less than 60 if the result is 30.","completion":"To find the percentage by which a number is less than another number, you can use the following formula: Percentage Difference = [(Original Number - New Number) / Original Number] * 100 In this case, the original number is 60, and the new number (the result) is 30.

Equating these expressions for t gives sqrt{3}x - y = sqrt{3}. Thus, A = sqrt{3}, B = -1, and C = -sqrt{3}. Substituting these values and the coordinates of point P into the distance formula, we get: d = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}|frac{1}{2}cos{θ} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin{θ} - 1| To find the minimum value of d, we analyze the expression inside the absolute value: f(θ) = frac{1}{2}cos{θ} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin{θ} - 1 This is a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, which can be rewritten as: f(θ) = Rcos{(θ + α)} - 1 where R = sqrt{(frac{1}{2})^2 + (-frac{sqrt{3}}{2})^2} = 1 and α = arctan{frac{-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}}{frac{1}{2}}} = -frac{π}{3}.

Although this involves expressing the original expression as a product, it does not fit the typical definition of factorization in the context of polynomials, as factorization usually involves integer or polynomial factors, not fractions or rational expressions.

There are 32 students in total, and 4 of them will be giving group presentations. This means there are 32 - 4 = 28 students giving individual presentations. Each individual presentation takes 5 minutes, followed by 3 minutes of questions and answers, making it a total of 5 + 3 = 8 minutes per individual presentation. For 28 individual presentations, the total time needed is 28 * 8 = 224 minutes. Now, let's calculate the time needed for the group presentations. There are 4 group presentations, each lasting 12 minutes. For 4 group presentations, the total time needed is 4 * 12 = 48 minutes. Adding the time needed for individual presentations and group presentations together, we get 224 + 48 = 272 minutes. Each period is 40 minutes long, so we need to divide the total time needed by the length of one period to find out how many periods are required. 272 minutes / 40 minutes per period = 6.8 periods.

Therefore, the total runs scored in the first 8 innings = 8 * A. In the 9th innings, he scores 90 runs. So, the total runs after 9 innings = 8 * A + 90. After the 9th innings, his average increases by 6 runs. So, his new average is A + 6. The total runs after 9 innings can also be calculated by multiplying the new average by the number of innings, which is 9. So, the total runs after 9 innings = 9 * (A + 6). Now, we can set up the equation: 8 * A + 90 = 9 * (A + 6) Expanding the right side of the equation: 8 * A + 90 = 9 * A + 54 Now, we can solve for A: 90 - 54 = 9 * A - 8 * A 36 = A So, Suraj's average for the first 8 innings was 36 runs.

Let's denote these points of tangency as follows: - ( M ) where the circle touches ( DA ), - ( H ) where the circle touches ( AB ), - ( N ) where the circle touches ( BC ), - ( K ) where the circle touches ( CD ). 2. **Properties of the Circumscribed Circle**: - In triangle ( AOB ), the altitudes from ( A ) and ( B ) are ( AA_1 ) and ( BB_1 ) respectively.

To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds. So, 72 kmph = 72 * (1000 / 3600) m/s = 20 m/s. Now, let's calculate the distance the train travels to cross the man. Since it takes 18 seconds to cross the man and the train is traveling at 20 m/s, the length of the train (L_train) is: L_train = speed * time = 20 m/s * 18 s = 360 meters. The train takes 34 seconds to cross the platform. The distance the train travels to cross the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform (L_platform). So, the total distance (D_total) is: D_total = L_train + L_platform. We know the train's speed and the time it takes to cross the platform, so we can calculate D_total: D_total = speed * time = 20 m/s * 34 s = 680 meters. Now we can find the length of the platform by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance: L_platform = D_total - L_train = 680 meters - 360 meters = 320 meters.

Mathematically, this can be stated as P(A) + P(B) = 1, where P(A) is the probability of event A happening, and P(B) is the probability of event B happening. Additionally, A and B cover all possible outcomes in the sample space. 2. **Definition of Mutually Exclusive Events**: If A and B are mutually exclusive events, this means that the occurrence of A prevents the occurrence of B, and vice versa. In terms of probability, this is expressed as P(A cap B) = 0, which means there is no overlap between A and B. 3. **From Complementary to Mutually Exclusive**: Given that A and B are complementary, it follows that they cannot occur together because the occurrence of one event implies the non-occurrence of the other. This directly satisfies the definition of mutually exclusive events, where P(A cap B) = 0. Therefore, if A and B are complementary, they must also be mutually exclusive. 4. **From Mutually Exclusive to Complementary**: However, if A and B are mutually exclusive, this does not necessarily mean they are complementary. Mutually exclusive events do not cover the possibility of covering the entire sample space together, which is a requirement for complementary events. For example, two mutually exclusive events might both have probabilities less than 1 when combined, and thus, do not complement each other to cover the entire sample space. Based on the above analysis: - The statement \\"A and B are complementary events\\" implies that A and B are mutually exclusive, making it a sufficient condition. - However, A and B being mutually exclusive does not imply they are complementary, making it not a necessary condition. therefore The correct relationship is that \\"A and B are complementary events\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"A and B are mutually exclusive events.\\" Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{A: Sufficient but not necessary condition}}."},{"prompt":"Given that the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of ((ax dfrac {1}{x})^{5}) is (32), the term with the largest coefficient in the expansion is ( ).

Since (x) is a positive integer, (sqrt{20x}) being rational implies that (20x) must be a perfect square. Hence, we let: [ 20x = k^2, ] where (k) is an integer. Therefore, [ x = frac{k^2}{20}. ] 8. Since (x) must be an integer, (k^2) must be a multiple of 20. Assume (k = 2asqrt{5}) where (a) is an integer, [ 20x = (2asqrt{5})^2 = 20a^2 Rightarrow x = a^2. ] 9. Similarly, let (y = b^2).

The top face of this cube along with the bottom face cannot have 3 dots because, if it did, then the cube above or below would have two faces with 3 dots which is not possible. - Therefore, the face with 3 dots must be one of the unseen faces that do not touch any other cube faces. 3. **Analyzing the Top-Middle Cube:** - The top face of this cube must have 3 dots, while the face just below it must have 2 dots. Hence, the bottom face of the top cube, which meets the top face of the middle cube, cannot have 3 dots. - Consider the face arrangements: three faces each with a varying number of dots (3, 2, and 1). 4. **Identifying the Dots on Visible Faces:** - For the middle top cube, the vertical face visible to us has 2 dots, and by the problem conditions, the dot pattern should be symmetric in the configuration of touching cubes. 5. **Considering the Left-Middle Cube:** - As the cubes are identical and since we’ve established a pattern, we can infer that the left vertical faces touching A, B, and C should logically follow the same dot distribution. - It’s deduced that the faces named A, B, and C maintain the symmetrical requirement and constraints due to the cube configuration. 6. **Final Dot Distribution:** - Suppose the left-middle cube has 2 dots on the visible left side face (\`B\`); similarly, the topmost edge cube will also have a pattern indicating 2 dots on \`A\`. - By elimination and logical arrangement of the cube faces and their respective dots, the middle cube’s side facing left will have \`C\` facing 3 dots. # Conclusion: - On the three left faces, denoted by ( A, B, ) and ( C ), the number of dots will be: ( A ) has 2 dots, ( B ) has 2 dots, ( C ) has 3 dots.

Now, let's find the ratio of their subscriptions: A : B : C = 21,000 : 17,000 : 12,000 To simplify the ratio, we can divide each amount by the greatest common divisor of the three amounts, which is 1,000: A : B : C = 21 : 17 : 12 The total ratio is 21 + 17 + 12 = 50. A's share of the profit is to the total profit as A's subscription is to the total subscription. Since A receives Rs. 15120, we can set up the proportion: A's profit / Total profit = A's subscription / Total subscription 15120 / Total profit = 21 / 50 Cross-multiplying, we get: 21 * Total profit = 15120 * 50 Dividing both sides by 21, we get: Total profit = (15120 * 50) / 21 Calculating this, we get: Total profit = 756000 / 21 Total profit = 36000 So, the total profit was Rs. boxed{36,000} ."},{"prompt":"Jeff committed to run for an hour a day during weekdays.

So on Thursday, he ran: 60 minutes - 20 minutes = 40 minutes Now, let's calculate the total minutes he ran for the other four days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday). We know that he ran for 290 minutes in total during the week, and we need to subtract the 40 minutes he ran on Thursday to find out how much he ran on the other four days: 290 minutes (total) - 40 minutes (Thursday) = 250 minutes Since he ran the full hour (60 minutes) on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, that's: 3 days * 60 minutes/day = 180 minutes Now, let's subtract the minutes he ran on those three days from the 250 minutes to find out how many minutes he ran on Friday: 250 minutes - 180 minutes = 70 minutes So, Jeff ran 70 minutes on Friday, which is: 70 minutes (Friday) - 60 minutes (planned) = boxed{10} minutes more than planned."},{"prompt":"A dealer sequentially deals cards one by one to a player from a wellshuffled standard deck of playing cards.

We need to prove that among all triangles formed by these points, there exists one with an area not greater than 2. **Step-by-Step Proof:** 1. **Total Number of Possible Points:** The rectangular region ( {(x,y) mid |x| leqslant 2, |y| leqslant 2 } ) contains ( (2 times 2 + 1) times (2 times 2 + 1) = 5 times 5 = 25 ) points.

This configuration spreads the points across the grid such that their convex hull bounds potential. 4. **Bounding of Triangle Areas:** To establish the area constraint: - Consider a triangle with vertices ((x_1, y_1)), ((x_2, y_2)), ((x_3, y_3)). - **Area Formula**: The area ( A ) of this triangle can be given by: [ A = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right| ] 5. **Maximum and Minimum Bound Proofs**: - Analyzing the spacing ( x_i, y_i ): Since (|x_i| leq 2) and (|y_i| leq 2), this constrains each term in our area formula. - For any non-collinear check to hold, disperse points on axes show specific vertices form triangles within confined areas. - Using combinatorial picking of points through pigeonhole principles shows at least one triangle subset formed within a bounded grid results in smaller areas due to less spread. 6. **Placement Verification**: Let's say each coordinate system segment (axis subsets): on ( y = 0, y = -2, y = 2 ) and same for ( x ).

Prove that one can divide the points into 20 groups, with 3 points in each group, such that the triangles ( 20 in total) consist of three points in a group have a nonempty intersection.","completion":"1. **Identify the Point ( P ):** The goal is to find a point ( P ) such that any line ( l ) through ( P ) divides the plane in such a way that there are at most 20 points on one side of ( l ). This ensures that ( P ) is within the convex hull of any subset of 20 points. 2. **Label the Points:** Assume we have labeled the 60 points in a clockwise order around ( P ) as ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{60} ). If two points lie on the same ray from ( P ), we can label them in any order. 3. **Forming Triangles:** Consider the triangles formed by the points ( P_i, P_{i+20}, P_{i+40} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 20 ). Each of these triangles will contain the point ( P ) because of the way the points are labeled and the properties of convex sets. 4. **Application of Helly's Theorem:** To show that such a point ( P ) exists, we use Helly's theorem. Helly's theorem states that for a collection of at least ( n+1 ) convex sets in ( mathbb{R}^n ), if the intersection of every ( n+1 ) of these sets is non-empty, then the whole collection has a non-empty intersection. 5. **Defining Sets ( S_v ):** For any unit vector ( v ), define the set ( S_v ) as the set of all points in the plane that are strictly higher than the 41st highest point among the 60 points when considering the direction of ( v ) as \\"up\\". This ensures that ( S_v ) is a convex set. 6. **Common Intersection:** We need to show that any three sets ( S_v ) have a common point. This can be done by considering the directions of the vectors and the relative positions of the points. Since each ( S_v ) is defined by the 41st highest point, the intersection of any three such sets will contain a point that is higher than the 41st point in all three directions. 7. **Conclusion:** By Helly's theorem, since any three sets ( S_v ) have a common point, all the sets ( S_v ) have a common intersection point. This point ( P ) is the point we are looking for, which lies within the convex hull of any subset of 20 points.

Since the tip is a certain percentage of the meal cost, we can express the tip amount as (P/100) * 37.25. The total amount paid is the sum of the meal cost and the tip, which is given as 40.975. So, we have the equation: Meal cost + Tip = Total amount paid 37.25 + (P/100) * 37.25 = 40.975 Now, let's solve for P: (P/100) * 37.25 = 40.975 - 37.25 (P/100) * 37.25 = 3.725 Now, we divide both sides by 37.25 to isolate P: P/100 = 3.725 / 37.25 P/100 = 0.1 Now, we multiply both sides by 100 to find the percentage: P = 0.1 * 100 P = 10 So, the minimum percentage of the tip is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"A movie theater company is advertising a deal for 20, which includes a movie ticket, a bucket of popcorn, a drink, and a box of candy.

This leaves us with 4 events (kicking shuttlecocks, jumping rope, pushing the train, and multi-person multi-foot) to arrange in the first 4 positions. 2. **Placement of Multi-Person Multi-Foot:** The multi-person multi-foot event cannot be placed in the first round. This means it can only be placed in the second, third, or fourth round. Thus, there are 3 ways to place the multi-person multi-foot event. 3. **Arranging the Remaining Events:** After placing the multi-person multi-foot event, we have 3 events left (kicking shuttlecocks, jumping rope, and pushing the train) to arrange in the remaining 3 positions. The number of ways to arrange 3 events in 3 positions is given by the permutation formula P(n, r) = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to arrange. Here, n = r = 3, so we have P(3, 3) = frac{3!}{(3-3)!} = frac{3!}{0!} = 3! = 6 ways. 4. **Total Arrangement Options:** Since the placement of the multi-person multi-foot event and the arrangement of the remaining 3 events are independent choices, we multiply the number of ways to find the total number of different arrangement options.

We start by considering the permutation ((a_1, a_2, a_3, dots, a_{2012})) of ((1, 2, 3, dots, 2012)). We need to find the expected value of the sum (sum_{i=1}^{2012} |a_i - i|). 2. For each (k), the term (|a_k - k|) represents the absolute difference between the position (k) and the value (a_k). Since (a_k) is a random permutation of ((1, 2, dots, 2012)), each value from 1 to 2012 is equally likely to appear in any position. 3.

Specifically, we need to compute: [ mathbb{E}[|a_k - k|] = frac{1}{2012} sum_{i=1}^{2012} |i - k| ] 4. To find the total expected value (S), we sum the expected values for each (k) from 1 to 2012: [ S = sum_{k=1}^{2012} mathbb{E}[|a_k - k|] = sum_{k=1}^{2012} left( frac{1}{2012} sum_{i=1}^{2012} |i - k| right) ] 5.

Next, we need to evaluate the double sum (sum_{k=1}^{2012} sum_{i=1}^{2012} |i - k|). Notice that (|i - k|) is symmetric around (k), so we can split the sum into two parts: one for (i leq k) and one for (i > k). 7. For a fixed (k), the sum (sum_{i=1}^{2012} |i - k|) can be computed as follows: [ sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (k - i) + sum_{i=k+1}^{2012} (i - k) ] The first sum is an arithmetic series with (k-1) terms: [ sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (k - i) = k(k-1) - sum_{i=1}^{k-1} i = k(k-1) - frac{(k-1)k}{2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ] The second sum is also an arithmetic series with (2012 - k) terms: [ sum_{i=k+1}^{2012} (i - k) = sum_{j=1}^{2012-k} j = frac{(2012-k)(2013-k)}{2} ] 8.

Mathematical Setup Using Division Algorithm:** Assume (r-2)n = (r-1)q + t for some integers q and t where 0 leq t leq r-2. Notice that q = leftlfloor frac{(r-2)n}{r-1} rightrfloor. **2. Contradiction Hypothesis:** Suppose the original statement is false. That is, for all vertices x in V, the degree d(x) geq q + 1. **3. Constructing Sets S_i:** Let S_i denote the set of vertices connected to vertex x_i. According to the assumption, |S_i| geq q + 1 for all i.

We need to find how many numbers can be selected from this interval such that the difference between any two selected numbers is not 4, 5, or 6. 2. **Setting up the contradictions:** Suppose we select 5 or more numbers from this interval. Since there are only 10 numbers, the differences between these selected numbers must include at least 4, 5, or 6 based on the pigeonhole principle. To illustrate, consider selecting numbers ( a, b, c, d, e ) such that ( a < b < c < d < e ). Without loss of generality, we can assume ( a ) is the smallest and ( e ) is the largest. We have the inequalities ( b-a, c-a, d-a, e-a ) such that: - ( b-a ) could be 2 or 8 (considering mod 10) - ( c-a ) must be such that ( (c-a) - (b-a) neq 2, 4, 5, 6 ) 3. **Checking differences:** If ( a < b < c ), we usually have: [ b - a = 2 quad text{and} quad c - a = 8 implies c - b = 6 ] This condition violates our initial requirement since ( c - b = 6 ). 4. **Limitation by parity:** Next, consider how we can select numbers based on their positions modulo 10, which helps avoid specific differences: - Group numbers ending in 1, 2, 3, 4 - Exclude those resulting in differences of exactly 4, 5, or 6 5. **Selection within each decade:** As we inferred, at most 4 numbers can be selected from any set of 10 consecutive numbers to avoid any difference that is 4, 5, or 6. Thus, for any sequence from ( {n, n+1, ldots, n+9} ), picking numbers like ( n, n+1, n+2, n+3 ) is optimal. 6. **Extending to 1000:** Given the entire range from 1 to 1000, it can be divided into 100 sets of 10 consecutive numbers (1000/10 = 100). If at most 4 numbers are selected from each set: [ 4 times 100 = 400 ] 7. **Verification:** Examples verifying this selection strategy may include sequences based on chosen criteria (numbers ending in specific digits avoiding forbidden differences). # Conclusion: By the reasoning and limitations illustrated, the maximum number of distinct integers from 1 to 1000, satisfying the given difference condition is: [ boxed{400} ]"},{"prompt":"For dessert, Jane's mom prepared 12 pieces of bitesize cinnamon swirls.

From the obtained number, the sum of its (the obtained number's) digits was subtracted again, and so on. After eleven such subtractions, zero was obtained. What was the starting number?","completion":"1. Let's begin by understanding the essential property given in the problem. We know that the difference between a number and the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. This means if we iterate this operation of subtracting the sum of the digits from the number multiple times, the resulting number will still be divisible by 9. 2. Now, starting from the end, we observe that we obtain zero after eleven subtractions. Hence, we need to trace back the numbers that could lead down to zero through these operations. 3. Any single-digit natural number, when subtracted by the sum of its digits, results in zero. Consequently, the number just before zero could be 9 since it is the only single-digit number which is also divisible by 9. 4. Since we perform this subtraction step 11 times to get to zero, we need to identify preceding numbers through this sequence. Each number must be divisible by 9, as noted: [ n_{11} = 0 implies n_{10} = 9 ] 5. For ( n_{10} = 9 ), the previous number within the sequence meeting the criteria would be: [ n_9 = 18 quad text{(since } 18 - (1+8) = 9) ] 6.

At this point, multiple paths can result in the value of 81. Specifically: - ( n_1 = 90 ) - ( n_1 = 99 ) 8. Going again backward from these numbers: - ( 99 ) can result from any number ( 100, 101, 102, ..., 109 ) as their sum of digits renders: [ 100 - (1+0+0) = 99, quad 101 - (1+0+1) = 99, quad ldots, quad 109 - (1+0+9) = 99 ] - However, ( 90 ) cannot be directly obtained from any such natural numbers proceeding these operations.

Therefore, the speed of the bullet in this case is: Speed of bullet + Speed of horse + Speed of wind = 400 fps + 20 fps + 10 fps = 430 fps When Wild Bill fires the gun in the opposite direction of the horse's run, the speed of the bullet relative to the ground is the speed of the bullet minus the speed of the horse and the wind speed, because they are in opposite directions. Therefore, the speed of the bullet in this case is: Speed of bullet - (Speed of horse + Speed of wind) = 400 fps - (20 fps + 10 fps) = 400 fps - 30 fps = 370 fps The difference in speed between the bullet fired in the same direction as the horse and the bullet fired in the opposite direction is: 430 fps - 370 fps = 60 fps So, the bullet is flying boxed{60} feet per second faster when Wild Bill fires it in the same direction as the horse is running, compared to when he fires it in the opposite direction."},{"prompt":"an examination, 25% of total students failed in Hindi, 48% failed in English, 35% failed in Mathematics, 27% failed in both Hindi and English, 20% failed in both Hindi and Mathematics, 15% failed in both English and Mathematics, and 10% failed in all three subjects.

Exactly one intersection occurs in this interval. - From x = 1 to x = 10, considering the function's increasing nature and periodic behavior of sin x oscillating and hitting many points, another two intersections happen when lg x = sin x. 5. **Conclusion on x > 10**: - When x exceeds 10, given that y = lg x continues to grow steadily, y = sin x will not intersect since the periodic should stabilize and not re-cross been sin x remains bounded between -1 to 1. - Beyond x = 10, no further intersections occur; thus, the number of real roots remains three. **Conclusion**: Thus the number of intersections of sin x = lg x results in exactly 3 intersections in the given context.

It can be shown that for a polyhedron of any genus, Euler's formula is mathscr{G}mathscr{P}+mathscr{B}=22 p","completion":"1. **Observation from previous problem**: Similarly to the preceding problem, we utilize the fact that the edges of the polyhedron form a certain network on its surface. This network divides the surface of the polyhedron into regions (faces), and the edges are line segments constituting the borders of these regions. This subdivision can be considered as a \\"map\\" on its surface. Observing this, we proceed to prove the Euler's formula mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{F} = 2 for the arbitrary map on the surface of a simply-connected polyhedron. Associated with each such map is its so-called dual map. 2. **Building the dual map**: The dual map is constructed as follows. Inside each region, we select one point, the \\"capital\\" of the region. Then, the points located in adjacent regions are connected by lines, such that each line intersects only the common border of these regions at a point different from the vertices. It is apparent that the number of regions mathscr{F} of the original map equals the number of vertices mathscr{B}' of the dual map. Each border between regions corresponds to a line intersecting it, and hence mathscr{P} = mathscr{P}'. 3. **Considering vertices in the dual map**: Let us now consider any vertex of the original map. Each line connecting the \\"capitals\\" of adjacent regions bounds an area inside which our vertex lies. Moreover, inside this area of the second map, there are no other vertices from the original map. Thus mathscr{B} = mathscr{F}'. 4. **Formula for dual map**: In this way, the original map is, in its turn, dual to the second, as inside the area of the second map, there will be only one \\"capital\\" and the borders of the original map connect these capitals, intersecting only the common capitals line. We have, hence, a series of theorems relating to the faces, edges, and vertices of the polyhedron, which are also true for any map if one replaces faces by vertices and vice versa (see, for example, problems 41, 44, 45). 5. **Using the dual map**: Utilizing the dual map, we reduce our task to considering networks defining these maps. 6. **Definition of a tree**: A tree is any network (we consider only connected networks) that does not contain any closed loops (Fig. 106a). ![Tree illustration](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_d3653343768e91d6de9ag-126.jpg?height=601&width=952&top_left_y=795&top_left_x=87) 7. **Important lemma**: For any connected network, the inequality mathscr{P} geq mathscr{B} - 1, where equality holds only for a tree. 8. **Proof by construction**: To prove it, perform the following construction. Take any vertex ( A ). Choosing one segment emerging from ( A ), designate another of its ends, then sequentially apply the same designation to all segments emerging from vertices. Once all vertices emerging from the initially considered vertices are designated, move on to segments connecting already assigned vertices, and so on (Fig. 106b). ![Proof by construction illustration](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_d3653343768e91d6de9ag-128.jpg?height=610&width=968&top_left_y=453&top_left_x=117) Each segment, in this process, is juxtaposed uniquely with a vertex (specifically, the end of the segment), but some vertices (excluding ( A )) may correspond to multiple segments, thus mathscr{P} geq mathscr{B} - 1 holds. For a tree, equality clearly holds: mathscr{P} = mathscr{B} - 1. 9. **Proving Euler's formula**: Consider transforming every network into a tree. By removing the segments causing previously matched vertices to remain connected, we turn the network into a tree. Clearly, all loops will split, resulting in all areas merging into one. Denote by ( D ) this tree obtained, and by ( D' ) the set of segments of the dual network intersecting the removed edges. 10. **Verifying D' is a tree**: It follows from properties of dual maps that D' is also a tree because otherwise ( D ) would split the surface into parts, containing a closed loop, contradictory to ( D ) being singly connected. 11. **Conclusion from calculations**: Combining the proven results based on the lemma, we get for both trees, mathscr{P} = mathscr{B} - 1 = mathscr{F} - 1 and mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{F} = 2 as desired. # Conclusion: boxed{mathscr{B} - mathscr{P} + mathscr{F} = 2}"},{"prompt":"There are 10 weights, and it is known that if any one of them is removed, the remaining 9 weights can be divided into three groups of equal weight. Is it necessary that all 10 weights have the same weight?","completion":"We are given 10 weights with the property that removing any one of them allows the remaining 9 weights to be divided into three groups of equal weight. We need to determine if this necessarily implies that all 10 weights are the same, or if it is possible for them to have different weights. Let's analyze this step by step: 1. **Construct a Counterexample:** To show that it is not necessary for all weights to be the same, we can provide a counterexample. Let's assume we have: - Seven weights of 1 gram each. - Three weights of 7 grams each. Let's label the weights: ( a_1, a_2, dots, a_7 ) (with each being 1 gram) and ( b_1, b_2, b_3 ) (with each being 7 grams). 2. **Verification when Removing Different Weights:** - **Case 1:** Remove one of the 1-gram weights: Suppose we remove ( a_1 ). The remaining weights are ( a_2, a_3, dots, a_7, b_1, b_2, b_3 ). We now have 6 weights of 1 gram and 3 weights of 7 grams. Let’s see if they can be divided into three groups of equal weight: Group 1: ( a_2 + a_3 + b_1 = 1 + 1 + 7 = 9 ) grams Group 2: ( a_4 + a_5 + b_2 = 1 + 1 + 7 = 9 ) grams Group 3: ( a_6 + a_7 + b_3 = 1 + 1 + 7 = 9 ) grams Thus, the remaining weights can be divided into three groups of 9 grams each. - **Case 2:** Remove one of the 7-gram weights: Suppose we remove ( b_1 ). The remaining weights are ( a_1, a_2, dots, a_7, b_2, b_3 ). We now have 7 weights of 1 gram and 2 weights of 7 grams. Let’s see if they can be divided into three groups of equal weight: Group 1: ( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 7 ) grams Group 2: ( b_2 = 7 ) grams Group 3: ( b_3 = 7 ) grams Thus, the remaining weights can again be divided into three groups of 7 grams each, which further shows that equal distribution is possible. 3. **Conclusion:** From the two cases above, we have demonstrated that it is possible to divide the remaining nine weights into three groups of equal weight regardless of whether we remove a 1-gram weight or a 7-gram weight. Therefore, this provides a clear counterexample. Thus, it is not necessary for all 10 weights to be of the same weight for the described condition to hold true.

Firstly, we start by identifying the center and the radius of the circle. The given equation of the circle is: [ x^{2} + y^{2} + 2x - 4y + 1 = 0 ] 1. **Complete the square:** - For the x terms: [ x^2 + 2x = (x + 1)^2 - 1 ] - For the y terms: [ y^2 - 4y = (y - 2)^2 - 4 ] 2.

By summing the contributions: [ angle ADB = 105^circ. ] Thus, the pentagon (ABCDE) formed is not regular since not all internal angles are equal, and specifically at (D), the angle is (105^circ) not (108^circ) (which would indicate a regular pentagon where each internal angle is (108^circ)). # Conclusion: Hence, it can be concluded that: [ boxed{text{No, the pentagon is not necessarily regular.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Simplify the value of cos 15^{circ}cos 45^{circ}cos 75^{circ}sin 45^{circ}.","completion":"To solve this problem, we will use the co-function identities and the sum-to-product identities for sine and cosine.

Since ( n ) is odd, ( (n-2, n) = 1 ). Therefore, if ( x mid n ) and ( x mid n-2 ), then ( x mid 2 ). But since ( n ) is odd, ( x = 1 ), which means ( a_{k-1} = n-2 ).

Initial Assumptions and Observations: 1.1 If all 100 numbers were negative, their sum would also be negative, contradicting the given condition that their sum is zero. Hence, there must be at least one non-negative number. 1.2 Consider a scenario where 99 numbers are negative.

Changing the Number of Non-negative Numbers: 2.1 Suppose there are ( k ) non-negative numbers among the 100 given numbers, labeled as ( n_1, n_2, ldots, n_k ), and the remaining ( 100 - k ) numbers are negative, labeled ( m_1, m_2, ldots, m_{100 - k} ). 2.2 The non-negative sums arise in two ways: - Pairs formed among the ( k ) non-negative numbers. - Pairs formed by one non-negative and one negative number. 2.3 The number of pairs among the ( k ) non-negative numbers is: [ frac{k(k-1)}{2} ] 2.4 If ( k geq 15 ), then: [ frac{k(k-1)}{2} geq frac{15 cdot 14}{2} = 105 > 99 ] We need to consider the case when ( k leq 14 ).

Since we exclude some negative numbers, the remaining sum is still positive, guaranteeing at least one non-negative sum per column. Step 4. Minimum Number of Non-negative Pairs: 4.1 Calculating total non-negative sums: - Sums among the ( k ) non-negative numbers: ( frac{k(k-1)}{2} ) - Sums where one number is non-negative and the other is negative: ( 100 - k ) 4.2 Total minimum non-negative sums can be represented as: [ frac{k(k-1)}{2} + (100 - k) = frac{(k-1.5)^2 + 197.75}{2} ] 4.3 Minimizing this expression within ( 0 leq k leq 100 ): - For ( k = 1 ) or ( k = 2 ), this number is 99. - For any ( k geq 2 ), the value is at least 99. # Conclusion: Thus, there are at least 99 pairs with a non-negative sum.

Consider the Euler's Totient Function varphi(n), which gives the count of integers up to n that are coprime with n. We can utilize the given function g(n) to solve this problem. The function g(n) satisfies: [ sum_{d mid n} g(d) = varphi(n) ] 2. Let's start by considering a few cases to understand the relationship between varphi(n) and g(n) and to find the values of g(d) for the relevant divisors. - For n = 1: [ varphi(1) = g(1) = 1 ] - For n = 2: [ varphi(2) = g(1) + g(2) = 1 Rightarrow g(2) = 0 ] - For n = 5: [ varphi(5) = g(1) + g(5) = 4 Rightarrow g(5) = 3 ] - For n = 10: [ varphi(10) = g(1) + g(2) + g(5) + g(10) = 4 Rightarrow g(10) = 0 ] - For n = 25: [ varphi(25) = g(1) + g(5) + g(25) = 20 Rightarrow g(25) = 16 ] 3. Understanding these cases, we can now solve for g(50). The divisors of 50 are 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.

According to the relation, we need to sum up these values and equate them to varphi(50). First, we compute varphi(50) using the formula for Euler's Totient Function: [ varphi(n) = n prod_{i=1}^{s} left(1 - frac{1}{p_i}right) ] where p_i are the distinct prime factors of n. For n = 50, the prime factorization is 50 = 2 cdot 5^2, hence: [ varphi(50) = 50 left(1 - frac{1}{2}right) left(1 - frac{1}{5}right) = 50 cdot frac{1}{2} cdot frac{4}{5} = 50 cdot frac{2}{5} = 20 ] 5.

By the definition of an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This property confirms that {a_n} is indeed an arithmetic sequence. Therefore, option **A** is **correct**. **B**: When n=1, from 2S_1 = 2a_1 = 1 + a_1, we solve to obtain a_1 = 1. For ngeq2, taking equation (1) 2S_n = 1 + a_n and equation (2) 2S_{n-1} = 1 + a_{n-1}, and subtracting (2) from (1), we get 2a_n = a_n - a_{n-1}, or a_n = -a_{n-1}.

From the given information, we know that the tank is filled in 40 minutes by repeating a cycle that consists of: - Pipe A filling for 1 minute at 200 L/min - Pipe B filling for 2 minutes at ( B ) L/min - Pipe C draining for 2 minutes at 25 L/min Let's calculate the total volume filled and drained in one cycle: - Volume filled by Pipe A in 1 minute: ( 200 times 1 = 200 ) liters - Volume filled by Pipe B in 2 minutes: ( B times 2 ) liters - Volume drained by Pipe C in 2 minutes: ( 25 times 2 = 50 ) liters The net volume change in one cycle is the volume filled by Pipes A and B minus the volume drained by Pipe C: [ text{Net volume per cycle} = (200 + 2B) - 50 ] Since the tank is filled in 40 minutes, and each cycle is 5 minutes long (1 minute for A, 2 minutes for B, and 2 minutes for C), there are a total of ( frac{40}{5} = 8 ) cycles to fill the tank. The total volume filled after 8 cycles should be equal to the tank's capacity, which is 2000 liters: [ 8 times (200 + 2B - 50) = 2000 ] [ 8 times (150 + 2B) = 2000 ] [ 1200 + 16B = 2000 ] [ 16B = 2000 - 1200 ] [ 16B = 800 ] [ B = frac{800}{16} ] [ B = 50 ] Therefore, the rate at which Pipe B fills the tank is boxed{50} liters per minute."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],W={key:0},I={key:1};function L(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(i(!0),a(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
