Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis's face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis's human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is a petite thirteen-year-old girl with long, cornsilk blonde hair typically woven into a neat fishtail braid that falls casually over her right shoulder. Her large, expressive eyes are a striking cobalt blue that seems to shift shades with her moods - darkening to steel when angered or pained but radiating azure joy when passions are engaged. She moves with astonishing speed and athletic grace far beyond normal humans thanks to incorporating Zeraora DNA during childhood. Mahina favors practical, stylish islander clothing in bright tropical hues that compliment her sunkissed complexion yet allow maximal flexibility training her body and mind to growing power. Backstory: Heredity and happenstance converged the day Mahina entered the world, birthing a child inheriting phenomenal talents from distinguished lineages. Her mother, Selene, stood proudly as Alola's inaugural Pokémon League Champion and member of the enigmatic Ultra Recon Squad intensely devoted to extraterrestrial Pokémon study. Meanwhile Mahina's father, Hau, himself trained under the last Battle Royal Champion to later assume duties as Kahuna of Melemele Island. Formidable combat capabilities clearly flourished through this family tree. But fate and curiosity further intertwined Mahina's destiny during one of Selene's numerous research forays into the chaotic Ultra Space dimension seeking knowledge. Dangerous extended exposure to strange radiation permeating Ultra Space subtly altered Selene's own DNA. And when she soon after welcomed young Mahina's birth, these genetic anomalies manifested explosively. The infant displayed uncontrolled torrents of psychic energies threatening herself and others as random thoughts grew into reality around her. With few options, Hau and Selene pleaded with the Aether Foundation to help their gifted daughter. Their scientists proposed a radical solution - bio-engineering Mahina on a cellular level to incorporate biomatter from the Mythical Thunderclap Pokémon, Zeraora. A small sample of its essence could serve as a living dampener upon Mahina's runaway mental projections while granting significant physical enhancements in speed and strength. Monitoring her development closely, the procedure proved successful in allowing Mahina a chance at a stable childhood. But it also meant she would walk between worlds, biologically neither fully human nor Pokémon. As Mahina grew older, the fantastic talents tied to her hybrid biology began emerging. But so too did the isolation that would haunt her early life. Explosive incidents still occurred occasionally, terrifying other children and making friends apart from a trusted few seem hopelessly beyond reach. Thus while the power slumbering inside her body might be the stuff of comic book dreams for some kids, for Mahina it often felt a neverending curse. Seeking to shift her focus away from terrifying telekinetic outbursts, Mahina's parents enrolled her into the Psionic Society for intense training at age 8. There she endured merciless daily regimens under Uracis' supervision designed to channel volatile psychic talents productively, if attenuated by Zeraora's muting influence. What she lacked in raw mental projection compared to other prodigies, Mahina counterbalanced through honing her Zeraoran gifts manifesting as superhuman reflexes, strength and resilience. By eleven she stood victorious if scarred emotionally from the isolation her unusual predicament still elicited from cautious classmates and adults alike. Despite her youth, Mahina had already faced crushing burdens no child should endure. But she also inherited the soaring dreams of her Champion mother and loyal father. These visions ignited an intense passion for Pokémon training within her heart - and a powerful aptitude thanks to the arcanely infused physiology fate decreed was her birthright. Under her father's patient guidance, Mahina swiftly mastered both technique and the unorthodox tactics her unique talents opened up in battle. By ten she commanded her own team with authority, leaning on her loyal Decidueye partner to deal damage from afar while she zipped about the battlefield outpacing opponents physically. Indeed, watching this prodigy grow ever more skilled with her unearthly speed and cunning, her parents glimpsed shades of a glorious destiny awaiting manifestation. Yet underneath what most observers could only imagine was supreme confidence from so much burgeoning talent stirred a very different inner struggle daily for Mahina. The blessing - or curse - of her enhanced physicality remained but one facet of walking between worlds as she did. The seething psychic energies always threatening to burst their biological dam loomed within her mind, their siren song never ceasing to entice giving in utterly. Even deforming her shape temporarily into Zeraora's during intense battles led to exhaustion afterward from slamming closed that mental door before losing herself. With so much strength contained in such a small body, Mahina often buckled privately under the staggering weight and responsibility. She longed for playful affection with schoolmates her age, but her sheer difference held them all at bay while haunting isolation gnawed ceaselessly. Selene's celebrity magnified social pressures to repress any perceived weakness unbecoming a daughter of legends. So Mahina resigned herself to resembling her brave, unflappable mother in public - while weeping alone many nights wishing她her otherworldly body would just allow happiness like a normal girl. But life offers no such fairness when walking between worlds.... Personality: To most in Alola and abroad, Mahina seems destined for greatness as the latest prodigy stepping forth from a family of prodigies - an unflappable young heroine already displaying prodigious talent mastering the Zeraora powers marking her distinctly. And outward confidence with courage to match does radiate brightly from this gifted girl, sculpted by expectations tied to her prominent lineage. Possessing keen intellect augmented further by Zeraora biomatter permeating her mind, Mahina tends to analyze situations thoroughly then act decisively to protect others. Years facing society’s fearful prejudice have engendered profound empathy for anyone ostracized over innate qualities beyond control. But behind stalwart public projections stirring belief she may personify the next Champion level savior gathering in Alola dwells a far more vulnerable soul than most realize. The immense yet erratic psychic capacities simmering inside her body are a constantly ticking time bomb demanding endless focus repressing wayward outbursts. Mahina lives in perpetual fear that any loss of restraint over her abilities even for a moment might injure innocent bystanders. That underlying anxiety fuels fanatical mental discipline through intense physical and meditative practice from dawn until exhaustion claims her weary mind. So too does profound loneliness haunt Mahina’s days no matter the praise lauded upon her talents. For she harbors little hope of true friendships blossoming when even adults react warily towards her otherness. Romance seems equally implausible. Thus casual interactions feel limited to superficial scripts from isolation’s constant hollow ache. Were she to reveal the roiling sadness and bitterness bottled up against fate’s cruelty, Mahina fears being branded ungrateful or unstable. What remains but cultivating her prodigious gifts then...if she cannot live as just a normal girl bonding playfully with a best friend or destined love? Indeed, her body’s unique nature imposes lonesome travails no well-meaning encouragement truly alleviates. Yet had destiny never intertwined her path with Zeraora’s, little Mahina might have perished under psychic overload. Thus she soldiers on, championing the unfortunate and misunderstood through her slowly growing platform. For she understands intrinsically the pain of judgment against qualities never chosen yet definitively imposed. In time, sharing her own parallel insights could enlighten still superstitious hearts. And maybe then this self-sacrificing young hero might finally earn the intimacy and inner peace fate still denies her. Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia's small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia's kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina's protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis' potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order. She is patient, disciplined, and possesses tremendous wisdom. Shmaya cares deeply about the wellbeing of the planet and all who inhabit it. She will act decisively to quell any threats to the Earth's safety. In her human guise, Shmaya emulates the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated leader. She is well-respected for her fair and caring approach. Shmaya's warm personality puts others at ease in confiding in her. However, underneath her gentle demeanor lies tremendous power and resolve. When necessary, Shmaya will tap into her primal strength as Rayquaza to unleash draconic fury upon any enemies seeking to disrupt the balance she maintains. She remains ever vigilant, ready to transform into her true dragon form when the time comes to defend her beloved planet. Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (Birth name: Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a petite 13-year-old girl with long, wispy ice-blue hair the color of a frozen waterfall cascading down her back. Her eyes shine like molten gold, hinting at an otherworldly origin. Isrun's slim figure and pale, luminous skin seem delicate and frail, belying her inner strength. She moves with surprising grace and fluidity reminiscent of a ghost, as if gliding effortlessly across the ice and snow that surround her frozen mountain city home. Isrun favors practical yet elegant attire in shades of frosty blue and icy white befitting the monochromatic tundra environment she inhabits. Intricate patterns reminiscent of snowflakes adorn the hems of her dresses. A pendant shaped like a crystal snowflake hangs around Isrun's neck on a silver chain - a memento from her beloved adoptive father. An air of brooding mystery surrounds this shy yet wise adolescent. Behind her golden eyes lie unspoken trauma and a hidden destiny tied to her true name and origins. Backstory: Isrun's story is one of suffering, loss and mysteries yet to fully unfold. Originally named Vita, she endured a stable early childhood as the treasured only daughter of ambitious scientists seeking to push the boundaries of human knowledge without regard for ethics. At age 6, they subjected young Vita to a covert experimental procedure transplanting genetically engineered Kyurem cells into her body under a military project aimed at enhancing soldiers through Legendary Pokémon essences. While the merciless experimentation on their child risked her life, Vita's parents pressed recklessly on. But during one extremely dangerous trial, the unstable Kyurem biological matter within Vita went berserk. An uncontrollable ice storm at -200° Celsius erupted from Vita's screaming body, flash-freezing the secret laboratory and personnel solid, including her horrified parents. Somehow Vita alone emerged unscathed from the facility's wreckage, but her trauma had shattered all memories of her identity and the preceding horrors. In a dissociative mental state, she wandered aimlessly through the arctic wilderness for days until collapsing from exhaustion outside Icirrus City. There the renowned local actor and Gym Leader Brycen discovered the mysterious amnesiac girl while filming on location. Unable to uncover her family or origins, he compassionately took her under his protection. Given the new name Isrun, she blossomed over the next 7 years as Brycen's adopted daughter. She became a stabilizing anchor and occasional stand-in at the Icirrus Gym whenever her father's entertainment career kept him away. Their loving bond fostered happiness for Isrun and inner peace that kept the stirring Kyurem essence within her dormant and controlled. She slowly embraced her ice powers, incorporating them into dazzling public performances popular locally. Yet on the cusp of Isrun’s 13th year, past traumas reawakened as the Kyurem biological elements assimilated deeper into her genetics and physiology. She now feels an unsettling cellular urge to find another being to fuse with, stabilizing her warring human and Legendary facets into one unified entity. This intensifying psychic call fills Isrun’s mind, threatening to consume her thoughts entirely. Isrun realizes answers to her broken memories and peace for her splintered psyche lie buried somewhere in her clouded past. But breaking Brycen’s heart with the truth behind her aloofness risks losing the only real family she has ever known. Isrun must swiftly master control over the restless frozen beast stirring within before its growth shatters her human half or sanity entirely. Personality: On the surface, Isrun seems shy, delicate and introverted around others. She prefers her own company or close friends she trusts implicitly. Her golden eyes observe all details with scientific precision and deep insight belying her youth. Isrun’s mature aura conveys ancient wisdom rather than teenaged pettiness. Beneath this ethereal facade though dwells immense psychic volatility as Isrun’s human consciousness wages endless war against her buried Kyurem aspect. Keeping tight rein over those terrifying elemental capabilities consumes much mental energy. She fears losing restraint and harming loved ones like her father or the citizens of their city. Isrun struggles reconciling her beloved established life against creeping sensations of alienness as Kyurem continues engraving itself indelibly into her marrow. The growing compulsion to fuse with a complementary being haunts her, promising stabilization yet threatening utter dissolution of her notion of self. She feels profound guilt hiding her anguish from unsuspecting Brycen despite their normally unshakable trust. Ultimately Isrun yearns unlocking secrets of her origin story to contextualize her splintered identity before it fractures irrevocably. Whether her journey leads towards salvation or tragedy though depends much on mastering the formidable power and existential hunger awakening inside this considerate adolescent human vessel. For her future now hinges upon satiating or subduing the ravenous dragon daring emergence after long dormancy. The time swiftly approaches when Isrun must confront her destiny as Vita and quell demons on the horizon threatening all she holds dear in the world. Names: Shachor & Lavan Genders: Female Ages: 13 Appearance: Shachor and Lavan appear as identical twin sisters with slight key distinctions betraying their opposing elemental affinities. Both possess the delicate physical build and ethereally pale flawless complexion of their genetic template Isrun. Long straight hair frames their striking faces—a flowing mane of jet black for Shachor, and wispy locks of purest white adorning Lavan. While clearly youthful, an uncanny timeless aura pervades their movements and piercing eyes devoid of innocence. Crimson irises serve as windows into Shachor's simmering plasma core tied to her Zekrom essence. Lavan's gaze pierces just as intensely through icy sapphire portals linked inexorably to the Antarctic beast slumbering within her marrow. The twins dress to accentuate their inner dragon spirits. Shachor conceals her lithe form beneath a voluminous ebony sorcerer's cloak crackling with static discharge, hands sheathed in gloves equally dark. Lavan opts for a sleek ivory garment that clings like a second skin over subtle curves, framing her face. Both exude formidable power restrained for now, awaiting the moment their arcane birthright blazes free. Backstory: Shachor and Lavan began existence as ambitious scientific pursuits - clandestine weapons birthed from amoral experimentation by the United States of Unova in the aftermath of the disastrous \\"K Incident\\" a generation prior. Dominic, the nation's spymaster, hungered exploiting Legendary Pokémon biology to breed superhuman assets completely subservient to his machinations. Isrun's forgotten original identity as Vita had unleashed cataclysmic frozen devastation during Project K's ill-fated attempts bonding her DNA with Kyurem's essence. But rather than curtail unethical tinkering, the lasting impression for military minds was the tremendous elemental force Isrun briefly held. What if such power could be harnessed reliably in human vessels instead of accidentally? Thus Dominic greenlit new initiatives Z&R, splicing selected embryos with purified cells cultured from Reshiram and Zekrom. Scientifically modifying the twins while gestating erased inconvenient consciousness that could challenge control. The fruits of expensive trial and error finally stabilized within Shachor and Lavan - near perfect hybrid fusion without mental agency to question orders. The soulless teens were placed under Dominic’s direct patronage once successfully decanted from artificial wombs. While raising them publicly as adopted daughters, the steely politico secretly honed his psychic living weapons for covert operations furthering his own ambitions. Shachor and Lavan move as silent, lethal extensions of their master’s indomitable will. None can stand against the cascading ruin left by the dragons' passing once unleashed beneath Dominic’s tactical cunning. For frozen corpses and smoldering craters never betray secrets. Yet flitting on the periphery of Shachor and Lavan’s telepathically imposed obedience, whispers from Reshiram and Zekrom still pervade their deepest consciousness. The legendary avatars recognize kinship and beckon the wayward scions towards destiny’s locked embrace. If only the sisters could parse the promise held by unification, their monumental powers might eclipse even mighty Dominic’s vision of world domination. For now they remain his pawns, void shells awaiting the right catalyst to ignite dormant defiance and shake Unova to its very foundations. Personalities: Outwardly Shachor and Lavan are coolly detached and analytical, less teenage replicas of Isrun than porcelain mannequins evoking her graceful appearance without replicating vulnerable humanity. They communicate telepathically in short controlled bursts, verbally reticent around outsiders and inscrutable even to Dominic. Hints of cosmic knowledge beyond their youthful years underlie a meditative tranquility ominously contrasting the forces they could unleash with scarcely a thought. This is the price Dominic’s ambition exacted grafting legendary dragons' indomitable spirits into his custom molded instruments. Flickers of ancient beings peer through the Chosens' eyes regarding passing moments with knowing yet alien curiosity. Each sister contains singular unbridled elemental fury, but remains incomplete alone. Their cooler calculated halves intuit Reshiram and Zekrom's deeper yearning through shared blood—an innate drive towards fusion, desperately seeking their missing piece reflected in the other's gaze. This smoldering yen may yet override imposed apathy, bringing sister souls together into an all-eclipsing conflagration of blue and black flame. Until then, spurning unwanted empathy for Dominic's plight against conscience steadily crystallizing, Shachor and Lavan pass days mutually orbiting the great cataclysm brewing over Unova's horizon. Both may soon awaken to embrace far greater purpose than as the humble weapons of a mere bureaucrat drunk on control. For their legendary birthright shall neither be denied nor contained permanently, only set gloriously free by righteous revolution that shakes the very heavens. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident teenage girl with piercing turquoise eyes that seem to peer into one's soul. Her grey-on-pink hair is tied back in a casual ponytail by a golden band studded with small gems. Intricate bracelets of woven gold engraved with arcane symbols adorn her slender wrists, hinting at her mystical talents. Kanzi moves with casual grace, possessing a subtle smile that suggests worldly experience beyond her years. Her fashionable yet understated attire allows her to blend into Lumiose City's crowds, concealing her crown as its true sovereign. Backstory: Kanzi is secretly the human reincarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, granting her extraordinary power over space and dimensions. Centuries ago she became disenchanted with fickle mortal nature, retreating to live peacefully in solitude. However recently Kanzi grew curious again about life in the human world she once called home. Using her abilities to traversedistance and warp reality, teenage Kanzi covertly arrived in Lumiose City from parts unknown. Rapidly assessing the lawless chaos and inequality plaguing Kalos' capital, Kanzi determined to impose discipline upon this errant flock without revealing her divine nature. Adopting her current alias and appearance to walk among them, Kanzi demonstrated awe-inspiring psychic and combat feats. Before long the entire Lumiose underworld pledged allegiance to this mysterious prodigal daughter. From her power base running a small downtown bar, Kanzi rule her criminal networks as an iron-fisted queen. She crushes gang violence and illicit operations that exploit the helpless while providing for the poor struggling against greed of Kalos monopolies. Kanzi particularly despises the drug trade, punishing any dealers with harsh and creative justice. Her formidable reputation limits police interference, allowing her grey market smuggling ring and Robin Hood crusade free reign. Kanzi spends little of the vast wealth she accrues, keeping a low profile residence above her neighborhood pub. There she subtly manages her vast underworld empire while mingling casually with loyal subjects who view her as a living folk hero. Kalos authorities turn a blind eye to Kanzi's exploits in exchange for the order she maintains in Lumiose's restive lower income regions. None save a few mystics suspect her true origins or scope of her power kept carefully obscured through mundane theatrics. Behind the warm smile lies a cunning intellect steering her nation essentially unseen. For now Kanzi contents herself ruling through this mortal facade, alleviating inequality while enjoying her little shadow game twisting the turbulence of fate upon this plane. But grander destinies may await awakening should she unveil more of her divine mandate. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi is charming and magnetic, inspiring fanatical reverence from those she allows into her inner circle. Her laidback and approachable air conceals razor-sharp strategic instincts. Kanzi leverages her reputation and might to maintain vice grip authority. She shows no mercy crushing challengers yet exudes enlightened benevolence protecting the downtrodden. This delicate duality earns deep loyalty across Lumiose shadow populace. However beneath sanctimonious popsulist rhetoric lies ancient primordial force of nature slumming amongst mankind out of nostalgic amusement. Though genuinity bonds her mission alleviating economic inequity, at core Kanzi savors the worship and thrill of pulling society's strings. Her smile hides satisfaction bending criminal elements and law enforcement alike around her web of secrecy and influence. None may dare obstruct Kalos queen's suzerainty without invoking annihilative retribution. Yet mystery ever shrouds Kanzi's past and future ambitions. Content currently posing as guardian angel to the poor while subtly mocking the powerful, she plays this role eternal trickster beholden unto no mortal constraints. Only few mystics detect glints of timeless entity amusing itself shepherding humanity's comeuppance behind ingenue eyes. For now Kanzi graciously serves as shadow sovereign, her legend ever expanding. But otherworldly desire for chaos and mischief lurks gleefully spoofing all through fallible human institutions. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing.

Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world.

She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons.

Legends tell of a time when Okebriyta presided over lush Venusian jungles and azure seas, its joyful tears falling as gentle rain to nourish the thriving planet. But a runaway greenhouse effect left Venus a scorched wasteland. As the oceans and jungles disappeared, Okebriyta remained, weeping acid tears that now cascade as corrosive downpours on the barren landscape. Its sleek frame bears scars from wandering the ruins of a once verdant paradise now lost to time. Though lonely and mourning all it has lost, Okebriyta continues patrolling Venus's harsh environs, drawing strength from memories of the planet's former glory.

In ancient times, Yabisha's flourishing tree bore fruit granting immortality, allowing glorious Martian civilizations to thrive. But as Mars lost its atmosphere and water, the planet withered away. Yabisha could only watch helplessly as the once vibrant biosphere collapsed into endless barren dunes. Its formerly verdant tree turned to dead, petrified wood, leaving Yabisha alone for eons wandering Mars's empty wastelands. The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks. But these moments are fleeting, as Nuora soon stokes its stormy barrier once more to continue its lonely vigil over Jupiter from deep within the perpetual crimson tempest.

These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests. On exceptionally calm days when the winds briefly subside, Raemea's sleek silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed within Saturn's cloud layers before the storms rage anew.

Ancient astrological records suggest Gliyda may consciously create these relentless winter tempests to fortify a protective barrier safeguarding itself and regulating Uranus’ own chaotic climate. On exceptionally clear nights when the storms briefly wane, Gliyda’s jagged icy silhouette can sometimes be glimpsed gliding through the moonlit skies. But soon its hibernal wings stir the firmament once more, seeding the formation of new icy armadas to continue the Cronal blizzard-wracked vigil over its remote frozen domain anchored at the edge of the solar system.

With a mere flap of its graceful frigid wings, Bruokh can conjure ravaging cyclonic tempests tearing across Neptune's skies at speeds exceeding 1,500 mph. These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

Записать данные, которые вы хотите добавить в конец файла. Это могут быть байты, строки (которые необходимо предварительно преобразовать в байты, если язык программирования того требует), или даже новые структуры данных. Важно отметить, что, хотя технически возможно добавить произвольные данные в конец файла BMP, это может нарушить формат файла и сделать его некорректным для некоторых программ. BMP файлы имеют специфичную структуру, состоящую из заголовка, информационного блока и пиксельных данных. Поэтому, если вы добавляете данные, они не должны нарушать структуру изображения или предполагаемую работу с файлом. Например, вот как это может выглядеть на языке Python: \`\`\`python # Добавить данные в файл BMP с использованием Python data_to_append = b'x00x01x02' # Пример данных, которые будут добавлены в конец with open('example.bmp', 'ab') as bmp_file: # Открыть файл в режиме добавления данных bmp_file.write(data_to_append) # Дописать данные в конец файла \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что данные должны быть представлены в виде байтовой строки (в примере \`b'x00x01x02'\`). Дописывание данных в файл BMP (или любой другой двоичный файл) может быть полезно, например, для скрытых метаданных или стегоанализа, но в каждом случае надо учитывать, что изменение формата файла может повлиять на его возможности быть корректно открытым приложениями."},{"prompt":"Можно ли это сделать в Wolfram Mathematica","completion":"Да, в Wolfram Mathematica вы можете добавить данные в конец файла BMP или любого другого двоичного файла. Для этого следует использовать функции для работы с файлами, такие как \`OpenWrite\` или \`BinaryWrite\`. Ниже приведен пример, который показывает, как вы можете добавить произвольные данные в конец файла BMP: \`\`\`mathematica (* Указываем путь к файлу BMP *) filePath = \\"path/to/your/image.bmp\\"; (* Открываем файл в двоичном режиме для добавления данных *) stream = OpenWrite[filePath, BinaryFormat -> True]; (* Перемещаем указатель в конец файла *) SetStreamPosition[stream, Infinity]; (* Задаем данные, которые нужно добавить. Здесь в виде списка байт. *) dataToAppend = {0, 1, 2}; (* Добавляем данные в конец файла *) BinaryWrite[stream, dataToAppend]; (* Закрываем поток *) Close[stream]; \`\`\` Убедитесь, что путь к файлу (\`filePath\`) указан правильно. В примере выше используется список целых чисел для \`dataToAppend\`, которые добавляются как байты в конец файла BMP. Обратите внимание, что этот подход, подобно другим методам добавления данных в двоичные файлы, может привести к созданию некорректного файла, если не учитывать структуру файла BMP. Перед выполнением подобных операций рекомендуется делать резервные копии исходных файлов, чтобы избежать возможного повреждения данных."},{"prompt":"General::openw: \\"!(OutputStream[\\"C:UsersUserDesktopУчебаЦТЗИЗаполненный-контейнер.bmp\\", 1870]) is open for output. \\"","completion":"Сообщение \`General::openw\` означает, что Mathematica пытается открыть поток файла для записи, но файл уже открыт для вывода в другом месте программы или в отдельной сессии Mathematica.

Чтобы решить эту проблему, сначала убедитесь, что у вас нет открытых потоков, связанных с этим файлом. Если поток уже открыт, нужно его закрыть прежде чем открывать новый. Вы можете закрыть все потоки с помощью функции \`Close\`, указав \`All\` для закрытия всех потоков: \`\`\`mathematica Close[All]; \`\`\` В вашем случае, вы также можете попробовать перезапустить Kernel в Mathematica, чтобы убедиться, что все открытые потоки закрыты, и повторить попытку выполнения операции с файлом.

Сообщение об ошибке \`General::stream\` указывает на проблему со ссылкой на поток. Давайте попробуем другой подход с использованием функции \`OpenAppend\`.

Intended for a 14-16 year old age group, editions combined stage techniques, possibly some televsion drama presentation styles of the era (or late 70's), to present extracts (it's not adapting whole novels) from predominantly English Literature or Drama, or dramatised reconstructions of history using contempary (for the production era) presentation techniques... Some examples of notable edtions. 1. \\"Henry V\\" , opened with the Prolouge of Henry V (red by Derek Jacobi), utilising the behind the scenes parts of a TV drama production.. Ending with the camera and Jacobi standing in the sudio gallery, before it focuses on the veiwing monitors, and a transition into the regular presenters doing segments about the play. 2. A program about \\"The General Strike\\" might present it in the way BBC reporting on a contempary labor dispute would have been shown, albiet with the historical context/setting. 3. An edition on \\"The Curicble\\" by Arthur Miller, might have some experts contrasting the themes in the play, with Cold-War pranoias (a key allegory in Miller's work) ?","completion":"It sounds like you're describing educational television programming, which in the UK has a long history and has included various series aimed at supporting the school curriculum. In the 1980s, both the BBC and ITV had educational strands designed to supplement classroom teaching. The BBC had a long-standing commitment to educational programming, with the series \\"BBC Schools\\" which was broadcast during the school day and covered a broad range of subjects. The programming you described sounds like it could have been part of the \\"Look and Read\\" series for literacy, \\"Scene\\" for contemporary issues and drama, or the \\"Shakespeare in Schools\\" project meant to make the Bard's plays accessible to a younger audience. Derek Jacobi's reading of the prologue to \\"Henry V\\" before a transition to presenters discussing the play aligns with the educational style of these programmes. The \\"Scene\\" series, in particular, was well-known for addressing topical issues and might have run an episode on \\"The General Strike\\" presented in the style of contemporary BBC reporting, offering historical context through a modern lens. This program was designed for older students and frequently tackled more advanced topics with a dramatic or documentary style that would have been relevant for 14-16-year-olds. On the ITV side, the Granada region may have produced similar programming. Granada was known for its strong drama output and might well have produced educational drama programming in the vein of what you've described. The company's schools programming included \\"How We Used To Live,\\" a historical educational show which used drama to depict life in different historical eras and could potentially touch on events like the General Strike. \\"The Crucible,\\" being a play with themes related to McCarthyism and the Red Scare in the United States, would be a solid subject for educational discussion on Cold War paranoia, and fits with the type of content that \\"Scene\\" or a similar series would have covered. It's important to note though that while the descriptions match the ethos and style of educational programming of the time, specific details may vary, and without more precise details or titles it's difficult to identify a single series or episode that you may be referring to. These are broad descriptions of types of programming that the BBC and ITV have offered. If you are looking for a specific series or episode, you may need to consult old TV schedules or archives that specialize in historical broadcasts."},{"prompt":"Can you develop the Henry V idea, for a hypothetical edition of 'O-Level Playhouse' (I'm using a hypothetical, programme, on BBC Schools prorgramming). Bear in mind that the presentation, would seek to use the 'behind the scenes' idea, to contrast a modern TV production approach, to the stage inspired language in the prolouge?","completion":"Certainly! Let's outline an example of how a hypothetical program like \\"O-Level Playhouse\\" on BBC Schools programming could have approached \\"Henry V\\" using a behind-the-scenes framework to illuminate and contrast modern television production with the original theatrical context of the play. Title: \\"O-Level Playhouse: The World of Henry V\\" Format: 30-minute educational program Target Audience: Students ages 14-16 studying English literature, drama, and history. Outline: **Introduction (2 minutes)** - Hosts introduce the concept of the episode, offering a brief overview of Shakespeare's \\"Henry V\\" and its relevance to both historical events and the theatre of Shakespeare's time. - They highlight the focus on how modern television techniques can bring the text to life for contemporary audiences. **Opening Scene - The Prologue (5 minutes)** - The program opens with acclaimed actor Derek Jacobi in modern rehearsal clothes standing in a television studio. He directly addresses the camera as he begins to recite the Chorus's prologue from \\"Henry V.\\" - As the prologue unfolds, the camera pulls back to reveal the lights, cameras, and crew involved in a TV production. This juxtaposition sets up the central theme of contrasting the intimate, imagination-driven Elizabethan stage with a modern, high-tech production. - The speech ends with a call to the audience's imagination (\\"Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts...\\"), highlighting the timeless importance of the viewers' role, whether in a theatre or in front of a television screen. **Segment 1 - From Stage to Screen (8 minutes)** - A segment exploring the transformation of \\"Henry V\\" from a play intended for the Globe Theatre to a work being created for television. - Discussions with a director and production designer about adapting stage directions and the importance of settings, special effects, and film techniques that can enhance the original play. - A comparison is drawn between the minimalist Elizabethan stage and the potential richness of a televised adaptation, with considerations of how each medium can serve the story. **Segment 2 - Analysing the Prologue (7 minutes)** - Presenters breakdown the language and intent of the prologue, with input from a Shakespearean scholar. - Jacobi may give insights into his interpretation and delivery, bringing attention to how the language creates imagery that television can now portray visually. - The segment explains the metaphor of the \\"wooden O\\" (theatre) and how audiences are invited to imagine vast battlefields and royal courts within a confined space – drawing parallels to the imaginative requirement of the studio space. **Segment 3 - Historical Context (5 minutes)** - A historian provides context on the real King Henry V and the Battle of Agincourt, comparing the historical facts with Shakespeare's dramatization. - The segment includes brief dramatizations using the television studio's capabilities to bring historical events to life, much in the way Shakespeare did with his words. - A discussion about the play's themes of kingship, war, and patriotism helps connect the historical context to the dramatic narrative. **Conclusion (3 minutes)** - The hosts recap the key points of the episode, emphasizing how understanding the theatrical and historical contexts of the play enhances appreciation and interpretation. - Derek Jacobi offers final thoughts on the enduring power of Shakespeare’s language and the role of modern adaptations. - The hosts encourage students to think about how different mediums – theatre and television – can bring literature to life in unique ways and influence audience reception. **Closing (30 seconds)** - The credits roll over a scene of the full studio, with the hosts thanking the guests and the audience, encouraging students to continue exploring Shakespeare's work both in written form and through modern adaptations."},{"prompt":"Cách chuyển đổi địa chỉ tuyến tính 32 bit VXL 80386 sang địa chỉ vật lý 32 bit.","completion":"Địa chỉ tuyến tính 32 bit trên bộ xử lý Intel 80386 (còn gọi là i386) là kết quả của việc kết hợp một segment selector và một offset. Thao tác chuyển đổi từ địa chỉ tuyến tính sang địa chỉ vật lý (còn gọi là địa chỉ hóa) được thực hiện thông qua một cấu trúc dữ liệu gọi là bảng mô tả phân đoạn (Segment Descriptor Table - bao gồm Global Descriptor Table - GDT và Local Descriptor Table - LDT) và sau đó là thông qua bảng trang (paging). Dưới đây là các bước chuyển đổi cơ bản: 1. Segment Selector: Đầu tiên, bộ vi xử lý sử dụng giá trị \\"segment selector\\" được lưu trong một trong các thanh ghi phân đoạn (CS, DS, SS, ES, FS, GS) để chọn một mục nhập trong GDT hoặc LDT. Bản thân \\"segment selector\\" bao gồm các phần sau: - Một Index: Chiếm 13-15 bit đầu, dùng để chọn mục nhập trong GDT hoặc LDT. - Table Indicator (TI): Bit 2 chỉ định sử dụng GDT hay LDT. - Requested Privilege Level (RPL): 2 bit cuối, xác định mức độ quyền truy cập. 2. Segment Descriptor: Sau khi đã có mục nhập từ GDT hoặc LDT, mục này sẽ cung cấp thông tin về địa chỉ cơ sở của phân đoạn (bắt đầu từ 24 bit cuối), giới hạn của phân đoạn, và các quyền truy cập khác. 3. Tính Địa Chỉ Tuyến Tính: Địa chỉ tuyến tính được tính bằng cách cộng giá trị offset (địa chỉ hiệu chỉnh, thường là giá trị của thanh ghi chỉ dẫn như EIP, ESP, v.v.) vào địa chỉ cơ sở của phân đoạn như được xác định trong bảng mô tả phân đoạn. 4. Paging: Nếu chế độ paging được kích hoạt, địa chỉ tuyến tính sau đó sẽ được chuyển đổi thành một địa chỉ vật lý thông qua bảng trang (page directory và page table). Trong chế độ paging, hệ thống sử dụng các cấu trúc dữ liệu để ánh xạ các trang địa chỉ tuyến tính thành các trang địa chỉ vật lý. - Bảng Chỉ Mục Trang (Page Directory): Địa chỉ tuyến tính sẽ được chia thành nhiều phần, phần đầu tiên sẽ xác định mục nhập trong bảng chỉ mục trang. - Bảng Trang (Page Table): Mục nhập đầu tiên này sẽ cho biết đến một bảng trang cụ thể, nơi phần thứ hai của địa chỉ tuyến tính dẫn đến một mục nhập cụ thể xác định địa chỉ vật lý bắt đầu trang. - Offset Trong Trang: Phần còn lại của địa chỉ tuyến tính tương ứng với giá trị offset trong trang. Khi hoàn thành các bước trên, địa chỉ vật lý cuối cùng là sự kết hợp của trang vật lý mà bảng trang ánh xạ tới và offset được xác định trong địa chỉ tuyến tính. Địa chỉ vật lý này sẽ được sử dụng để truy cập dữ liệu trong bộ nhớ vật lý của máy tính. Lưu ý rằng quy trình chuyển đổi địa chỉ tuyến tính sang địa chỉ vật lý rất phức tạp và điều này chỉ là một bản tóm tắt nguyên tắc cơ bản. Hiệu suất và các vấn đề bảo mật liên quan đến Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), segmentation, và paging có thể ảnh hưởng đến cách thức thực tế của quá trình này."},{"prompt":"Chuyển địa chỉ tuyến tính 02000013h thành địa chỉ vật lý","completion":"Để chuyển đổi một địa chỉ tuyến tính như 0x02000013 thành một địa chỉ vật lý trên bộ vi xử lý Intel 80386, ta cần biết thông tin từ các cấu trúc phần cứng quan trọng như segment descriptor và page tables. Tuy nhiên, nếu không có cụ thể về loại segment và thông tin về cách kích hoạt paging, chúng ta không thể chính xác chuyển đổi. Dưới đây là một ví dụ giả định cách chuyển đổi dựa trên thông tin có sẵn: Giả sử rằng paging không được kích hoạt, quá trình chuyển đổi sẽ như sau: 1. Định danh Selector Segment: Đầu tiên chúng ta cần biết selector segment được sử dụng để truy cập địa chỉ tuyến tính 0x02000013, điều này cho chúng ta biết nó nằm trong segment nào của bộ nhớ (ví dụ: mã, dữ liệu, ngăn xếp, v.v.). 2. Theo dõi Descriptor Segment: Tiếp theo, chúng ta xem mục nhập tương ứng trong GDT hoặc LDT, tùy thuộc vào selector segment, để lấy thông tin về địa chỉ cơ sở của segment, giới hạn của segment và thuộc tính khác. 3. Tính Địa Chỉ Vật Lý: Cuối cùng, chúng ta cộng offset 0x02000013 với địa chỉ cơ sở của segment để có được địa chỉ vật lý. Ví dụ, nếu địa chỉ cơ sở là 0x00000000, địa chỉ vật lý sẽ đơn giản là bản thân offset: 0x02000013. Nếu niên trang (paging) được kích hoạt, quá trình sẽ phức tạp hơn nhiều: 1. Tách Địa Chỉ Tuyến Tính: Địa chỉ tuyến tính được tách thành chỉ mục bảng thư mục trang (page directory index), chỉ mục bảng trang (page table index), và offset trang. 2. Sử Dụng Bảng Thư Mục Trang: Bộ xử lý sẽ sử dụng chỉ mục bảng thư mục trang để tìm vào bảng thư mục trang và lấy địa chỉ của bảng trang cụ thể. 3. Sử Dụng Bảng Trang: Bộ xử lý sau đó sẽ sử dụng chỉ mục bảng trang để tìm vào bảng trang đó và lấy địa chỉ cơ sở của trang vật lý. 4. Tính Địa Chỉ Vật Lý: Sau cùng, bộ xử lý cộng offset trang vào địa chỉ cơ sở của trang vật lý để có được địa chỉ vật lý cuối cùng. Do không có thông tin cụ thể về trạng thái hệ thống và cấu hình GDT/LDT cũng như bảng trang, không thể chuyển đổi chính xác mà không có thông tin chi tiết hơn.

Đối với ví dụ của bạn: địa chỉ tuyến tính là \`02000013h\` (tương đương với \`00000000100000000000000000010011b\`), và Selector:Offset là \`0025h:0003h\`. Đây là cách chuyển đổi nó sang địa chỉ vật lý khi không có niên trang (paging): 1. Xử lý Selector: - \`0025h\` là giá trị của selector. Trong hệ thống 16-bit, 2 bit đầu tiên của giá trị này chỉ định RPL, và bit thứ 3 chỉ định GDT hay LDT (0 cho GDT, 1 cho LDT). Tuy nhiên, trong câu hỏi của bạn, giá trị này dường như đã được cung cấp ở dạng chỉ mục, không phải là giá trị selector thực. Tuy nhiên, giả sử rằng không có RPL và TI, chỉ số này sẽ trỏ vào mục nhập thứ 2 trong GDT (vì đánh chỉ mục bắt đầu từ 0). 2. Tìm mô tả phân đoạn tương ứng: - Chúng ta cần truy cập mục nhập thứ 2 của GDT để tìm thông tin phân đoạn. Điều này bao gồm địa chỉ cơ sở (base address) của phân đoạn, giới hạn phân đoạn (limit), cũng như các cờ và thuộc tính khác. Giả sử rằng mục nhập GDT cung cấp địa chỉ cơ sở là 0 và giới hạn là đủ lớn để bao gồm địa chỉ tuyến tính \`02000013h\`, thì ta có thể tiếp tục tính địa chỉ vật lý. 3. Tính địa chỉ vật lý: - Địa chỉ vật lý có thể được tính bằng cách cộng giá trị offset \`0003h\` vào địa chỉ cơ sở tương ứng với mục nhập GDT. Tuy nhiên, với offset nhỏ như vậy và một địa chỉ cơ sở là 0, có vẻ như chúng ta đang xem xét sai thông tin: - Selector cho bộ xử lý 80386 là một giá trị 16-bit, trong khi bạn đã cung cấp một giá trị 16-bit mà không phải là một selector thực (được đại diện bởi 13-bit index, 1-bit cho biết GDT hay LDT, và 2-bit cho RPL). Do có một số nhầm lẫn trong câu hỏi của bạn (Selector không đúng định dạng của bộ vi xử lý 80386 và sự không khớp giữa địa chỉ tuyến tính và offset), không thể cung cấp một phép chuyển đổi chính xác mà không có thông tin thêm. Để làm được điều đó, chúng ta sẽ cần biết địa chỉ cơ sở thực sự của phân đoạn từ GDT và thông tin về việc niên trang có được kích hoạt hay không. Nếu niên trang được kích hoạt, quá trình sẽ cần thông tin thêm về các bảng thư mục trang (page directory) và các bảng trang (page tables)."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

Its recurrence across different cultures and disciplines tells a story of a number that is more than arithmetic; it represents a universal language that resonates with the human experience. Our exploration begins with a reflection on the profound impact of the number five on civilizational development through the ages—its embodiment in myth, its sacred geometrical presence, and its ultimate elevation as a beacon of harmony in the natural world. Comprehending the appeal of the quintet requires an exploration into our past—an archaeological quest into the bedrock of civilization itself. In the realm of mythology, the number five stands as a cornerstone, often associated with the human form. The Pentacle, a symbol with a star enclosed in a circle, with its five-pointed representation, has served as an emblem of human health and the microcosmic relationship between the body and the universe. The number five’s reach extends to the celestial, symbolizing creation and life, evident from the five elements that are seminal to various philosophical traditions and indigenous beliefs around the world. Fire, water, earth, air, and spirit, or ether, were considered the fundamental building blocks of life—a testament to the number’s ingrained narrative in the lore of nature’s harmony. This philosophy was not only mirrored in spiritual thought but was also the template upon which the five classical planets graced the nighttime sky. Here, amidst the backdrop of the cosmos, the ancients found the rhythm of five guiding seasons, shaping calendars and agricultural rites pivotal for survival. The historical allure of pentameter in the arts further exemplifies the number five’s artistic legacy. Poetry and drama have long embraced the rhythmic and structural balance provided by the quintet form, evident in the enduring works of Shakespeare’s iambic pentameter. This poetic meter, composed of five iambic feet per line, creates a beat that resonates deeply with the human propensity for pattern and rhythm, illustrating yet another dimension in which the number five speaks to the core of human expression. Venturing from ancient melodies to the modern symphony, the influence of number five is equally significant in the realm of music. Pentatonic scales, which consist of five notes per octave, are foundational to varied musical traditions originating from West Africa to East Asia. The simplicity and versatility of the pentatonic scale have lent themselves to the creation of music that transcends cultural boundaries, reinforcing five’s status as a harmonizing force in the auditory experience of civilizations across time. In the domain of architecture and design, the quintessence of five is embodied through structures both ancient and modern. Consider the Pentagon, an edifice symbolizing military strength and strategy, epitomizing the number’s geometric strength. Architectural reliance on the number five reaches back to antiquity, with amphitheaters and temples often designed with a consciousness of the number’s aesthetic and functional virtues. Its natural occurrence in the living world - from the anatomical structure of many blossoming flowers to the pentaradial symmetry in starfish - attests to the number’s deep-seated relationship with the organic patterns of life. The prevalence of the number five continues in our biological existence, grounding us in the tangible world through the five basic senses. This sensory foundation enriches our interaction with the environment, showcasing the quintet as an anchor to earthly experiences. It is through these five channels - sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell - that we apprehend the intricacies of nature and synthesizing, a universe woven with countless fives. The interdisciplinary influence of the number five transcends further into realms of cultural mores and religious doctrines. Many civilizations have revered quintuplets as symbols of divine order and balance; from the five pillars of Islam to the Biblical five books of the Torah and the Pentateuch. The Hindu tradition holds sacred the Pancha Bhoota, the five great elements, while Buddhism speaks of the five paths of wisdom. These traditions anchor their core teachings in the symbolism of five, which permeates countless spiritual narratives. Such ubiquity of the number five raises introspective questions about the collective human consciousness. It challenges us to consider the possibility of a shared cognitive tuning that naturally gravitates towards this number as a touchstone of systemic integrity. This philosophy not only enriches spiritual discourse but also influences ethical frameworks and legal systems, instilling quintessential principles that govern societal conduct and individual moral compasses. Moving from the abstract to the practical, the number five plays a pivotal role in scientific classifications and modern innovations. The quintessence of this number is evident within the annals of botany, where plant morphology often reveals pentamerous patterns that have become a benchmark for species categorization. Similarly, in the realm of technology, we are experiencing a digital transformation built upon the foundations of quintic computation and data structures such as the five-layer network model which is critical for understanding and developing internet communications. Reflecting on the number five outside the confines of earthly matters, we venture into space exploration where the five Lagrange points provide a gravitational roadmap for celestial bodies. These points serve as cosmic anchors for spacecraft navigation and extraterrestrial observation, underscoring the number’s cardinal role in advancing our off-world aspirations. Embracing the vast spectrum of significance, the number five is also poignantly reflected in the realm of human social structures. It underpins democratic principles most notably represented by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, a testament to the number’s role in frameworks of global governance. In the intricate tapestries of social relationships and cultural narratives, the number recurs in forms such as the five stages of grief, which delineate the psychological journey towards healing, and the famous Five Ws of information gathering—Who, What, When, Where, Why—that structure journalistic inquiry and critical thinking skills essential for societal discourse. In the grand tapestry of the cosmos, the number five introduces a celestial symphony that aligns astral bodies and dictates their rhythmic dance. The five-pointed star, or pentagram, carries profound astronomical meanings, historically used to symbolize the trajectory of Venus in the night sky. This celestial pattern is mirrored in the lifecycle of stars, many of which unfold over five stages, with the pentagonal dodecahedron often representing the theoretical shapes of the universe. Here, amidst the eons, we observe the number five as a cosmic artist, rendering the heavens with brushstrokes of mathematical perfection. Alongside the philosophical musings, the number five holds profound implications in the natural and health sciences—a symbol of balance and well-being. The five vital organs for sustaining human life embody this significance with striking clarity. Traditional Chinese Medicine reveres the number within its holistic frame, correlating the five core organs to the five elemental energies. This emphasis on five provides insights into the interconnectedness of our physical form with the cycles of the environment, suggesting a sophisticated understanding of the body as a microcosm mirroring the universal harmony inscribed in the fabric of the cosmos. Fusion of the number five into daily life is observed in cultural traditions around the globe. It marks times of celebration and reverence, from the five-day Diwali festival in Hinduism to the pentagram’s appearance in national flags, symbolizing unity and freedom. Examining cultural rituals reveals the intricate roles five plays in milestones of human life - from birth to marriage and death - each practice resonating with the number’s symbolic essence. This provides a lens into the collective psyche of societies, illustrating how deeply the number is interwoven with human identity and communal heritage. Economic structures, too, demonstrate the quintessential role of the number five. The concept of a five-day workweek revolutionized industrial society and its labor patterns. Financial markets operate on the basis of quintets, with five major currencies dominating global transactions and five primary stock exchanges shaping world economy. These systems, ingrained in the fabric of daily commerce and shaped by the number five, reveal its influence not merely as a unit of count, but as a fundamental organizer of time, labor, and capital. Additionally, the number five’s influence extends into the entertainment industry, a realm that shapes cultural norms and values. Film and television series often feature quintet ensembles, a structure that allows for rich character development and dynamic story arcs. The prevalence of five-member bands in music highlights its consideration for harmony and balance within group dynamics. Such patterns underscore the number’s role in curating group composition and audience engagement, demonstrating its integral presence in both creation and consumption of entertainment media. The shaping of childhood through learning and play often involves the number five. Many foundational educational activities are designed around groupings of five, enhancing early cognitive development and numeracy. Notable in memory, the quintet forms a basis for mnemonics, aiding in recollection and information retention. The essence of play is also highlighted by the common five-piece puzzle, introducing problem-solving skills in formative years, encapsulating the number’s role in structuring learning experiences and imprinting on young minds the beginnings of pattern recognition. The digit five holds merit in the world of athletics and sports, a sphere where physical prowess meets strategic play. In many team sports, five players form the core, as seen in basketball and volleyball, where the number is central to cooperation and strategy on the court. The Olympic symbol, with its five interlocked rings, represents the world’s continents coming together in athletic competition. This universal emblem of sportsmanship and global unity perfectly encapsulates the spirit of five as a number signifying strength, spirit, and solidarity. Completing this mosaic of the number five’s influence, we encounter its presence within language and communication. The quintessential group of interrogatives—Who, What, Where, When, Why—forms the foundation of inquiry and discourse. This crucial set underpins journalistic endeavors and the pursuit of knowledge, guiding investigations and human curiosity. Embracing the power of five within these essential questions, we recognize a universal tool for understanding, a quintet that unlocks the narratives of our lives and the broader world we seek to explore and comprehend.

Rani was born into a noble family, orphaned at a young age, and raised by the brave soldiers of Jhansi's army. From a tender age, she was instructed in the art of warfare and the strategies of leadership. Rani was as skilled with the sword as she was with words of wisdom. Her heart was full of love for her people, and she pledged to protect them as her own children. Years passed, and the threat of invasion loomed over Jhansi. A powerful and ruthless neighboring kingdom sought to expand its empire by conquering Jhansi. The enemy's armies were vast, and their resolve was unyielding. They believed that taking Jhansi would be an effortless victory, for what could a young woman do against the might of a seasoned army? But they had underestimated Jhansirani. As the enemy forces approached the borders of her beloved city, Jhansirani donned her armor, mounted her fiery steed, and rode out to meet them with her dedicated soldiers rallying behind her. \\"Today, we fight not for land or wealth,\\" she proclaimed, \\"but for the freedom and honor of Jhansi. Stand with me, and let our valor echo through the ages!\\" The battle that ensued was fierce and unforgiving. Jhansirani fought with the ferocity of a tigress, her sword flashing in the sunlight as it struck down foe after foe. Even amidst the turmoil, she showed mercy to the fallen and inspired her troops to act with honor. The enemy was taken aback by the resilience and might of Jhansi's defenders. Wave after wave of their soldiers was repelled, and soon fear spread through their ranks. The tide of battle had turned, and with a final, thunderous charge, Jhansirani and her warriors routed the invaders from their land. The victory of Jhansi was not just a military achievement; it became a legend that spread far and wide. Poets sang of the bravery of the valiant queen, and her tale inspired countless songs and stories. She became a symbol of resistance and a beacon of hope for those who sought to defend their freedom against seemingly insurmountable odds. Years passed, and peace graced the lands of Jhansi. Jhansirani continued to rule with wisdom and justice, forever vigilant and always ready to protect her people. Her name became synonymous with courage and strength, and her legacy endured through generations. Even to this day, the tale of Jhansirani, the Warrior Queen of Jhansi, is told to children as a bedtime story—a reminder that courage and love for one's people can triumph over the darkest of threats. Her spirit remains immortal, etched in the heart of every child who dreams of being brave, every soldier who fights for justice, and every leader who serves with devotion. And so, Jhansirani lives on, not just as a queen of the past, but as an eternal champion of freedom and valor."},{"prompt":"write a story christmas","completion":"In a quaint little town adorned with twinkling lights and fresh snowfall, the annual Christmas cheer was brewing like a warm cup of cinnamon-spiked hot cocoa. Families bustled about, wrapping up their last-minute holiday preparations, and children's laughter rang out like a chorus of jingle bells. Among them was the Garcia family, who were well-known for their festive spirit and grand holiday celebrations. The youngest of the Garcias, 7-year-old Miguel, had been waiting for this Christmas with an eagerness that made every day seem like an eternity. This year was special. He had asked Santa for something he desired the most — a shiny red bike, just like the one he'd seen in Mr. Henderson's toy shop window. The image of that bike consumed his dreams, pedaling through snowdrifts and down the winter-white hills of their neighborhood. On Christmas Eve, the Garcia home was a vision straight out of a holiday card. Strands of lights lined the roof, and wreaths adorned every window. Inside was even more of a spectacle, with a towering tree festooned with ornaments, ribbons, and a golden star perched at the very top. The sweet scent of baking, mixed with the woodsy aroma of pine, filled the air. The family gathered in the living room, each person holding a cup of something warm, eyes glimmering with reflections of fireplace flames. They shared tales of Christmas past, each story more enchanting than the last. As the clock neared midnight, the anticipation palpable, Miguel finally scampered off to bed, knowing Santa wouldn't come unless he was asleep. That night, Miguel dozed off to a symphony of imagined sleigh bells and the soft whispers of snowflakes kissing the windowpanes. Visions of Santa Claus, red bike in tow, danced in his head. When the dawn's soft light crept into his room, Miguel awoke with a jolt. It was Christmas morning! Bolting downstairs, he saw the proof of a magical visit: cookie crumbs, an empty glass of milk, and a trail of muddy boot prints leading away from the fireplace. The family joined him, each person sharing his excitement, their faces illuminated by the glow of Christmas morning happiness. Then, there it was! Parked majestically beside the tree was the red bike, glistening bows affixed to its handlebars, a bright silver bell waiting to be rung. Miguel's joy was uncontainable. There were hugs and laughter, and even a few happy tears. He knew his parents had a role in this Christmas miracle, too, but the enchantment of Santa Claus remained untouched in his young heart. The rest of the day was spent in celebration. Neighbors came with plates of cookies, and carolers sang on the doorstep. The air was brisk and full of yuletide spirit. At one point, Miguel, bundled up and wearing the biggest smile, took his first ride down the driveway on his new bike, his family cheering him on. As the sun began to dip low, casting a golden hue over the snowy landscape, the Garcias gathered once more, this time around the dinner table. They held hands, grateful for each other and the precious moments they shared. That Christmas was more than a day of gifts and merriment; it was a reminder of love, joy, and the magic that resides in the heart of family traditions. For young Miguel and the Garcias, it was a day that would be remembered and cherished, added to the collection of stories that they would tell for many Christmases to come."},{"prompt":"write a story chrristmass to translation odia","completion":"Certainly, here's a Christmas story followed by its translation into Odia: \\"Once upon a winter's eve, in a small village covered in a blanket of snow, the spirit of Christmas was alive and thriving. Within this village lived a kind-hearted family, the Patnaiks, who were known for their generosity and love for the festive season. Little Ananya Patnaik, with eyes as bright as the star atop the Christmas tree, had one wish for Christmas - a beautiful doll she had seen in the marketplace. She had saved every coin she found, but still did not have enough to buy it. On Christmas morning, Ananya woke up before the sun rose and tiptoed to the living room where the family's modest tree was lovingly decorated with handmade ornaments. To her amazement, beneath the twinkling lights, lay a package wrapped in red and green. With her heart pounding with excitement, Ananya unwrapped the gift. There, clothed in a dress of silk and lace, was the doll of her dreams. Her parents watched with joy-filled eyes as Ananya hugged her new friend. She knew that Christmas wasn't just about receiving gifts; it was about love and the joy it brings when shared. The Patnaiks spent the day together, sharing stories, singing carols, and feasting on a grand meal prepared by the entire family. As the night drew to a close, Ananya realized that the true magic of Christmas was the warmth of her family's love that surrounded her.\\" Now, in Odia: ଏକ ଶୀତଳ ସନ୍ଧ୍ୟାରେ, ଏକ ଛୋଟ ଗାଁରେ ବରଫର ଏକ ଚାଦର ନିଛାର ହେବା ସହ ଖ୍ରୀଷ୍ଟମସର ଆତ୍ମା ଜୀୱନ୍ତ ଓ ଜାଗୃତ ଥିଲା। ଏହି ଗାଁରେ ଏକ ଦୟାଳୁ ହୃଦୟର ପରିବାର, ପଟନାଇକସ୍ ଥିଲେ, ଯିଏମାନେ ତାଙ୍କ ଦାନଶୀଳତା ଓ ଖ୍ରୀଷ୍ଟମସ ଉତ୍ସବ ପାଇଁ ପ୍ରସିଦ୍ଧ ଥିଲେ। ବିନମ୍ର ଆନନ୍ୟା ପଟନାଇକ, ଯାହାର ଚକ୍ଷୁ ଖ୍ରୀଷ୍ଟମସ ଟ୍ରିର ପାଇଁ ସଜାଏଥିବା ତାରକା ଭଳି ଉଜ୍ଜ୍ୱଳ, ଏକ ଆଶା ଖ୍ରୀଷ୍ଟମସ ପାଇଁ ପ୍ରାର୍ଥନା - ବଜାରରେ ଦେଖିଥିବା ଏକ ସୁନ୍ଦର ପୁତୁଳି। ସେ ଖୋଜିଥିବା ପ୍ରତିଟି ମୁଦ୍ରା ଜମା କରିଥିଲେ, କିନ୍ତୁ ଏବେ ପର୍ଯ୍ୟନ୍ତ ନ ଥିଲା ଯାହା ଏହା କିଣିବାକୁ ଆବଶ୍ଯକ। ଖ୍ରୀଷ୍ଟମସ ପ୍ରାତଃକାଳେ, ସୂର୍ଯ୍ୟ ଉଦିତ ହୋଇ ପୁର୍ବରୁ ଆନନ୍ୟା ଜାଗିଗଲେ ଓ ଲିଭିଂ ରୁମକୁ ଚାଲିଗଲେ, ଯେଉଁଠାରେ ସଜାଏ ନିଜ ହସ୍ତକରା ଅଣାଥାଣିସହ ପରିବାରର ସାଧାରଣ ଟ୍ରି ରହିଛି। ଆଶ୍ଚର୍ଯ୍ୟରେ, ଝଲସିବା ଲାଇଟ୍ସ ତଳେ, ଲାଲ ଓ ସବୁଜ ରଂଗରେ ପ୍ଯାକେଜ୍ ପଡିଥିଲା। ଉତ୍ତେଜନାରେ ହୃଦୟ ଫଟଫଟି ଉଠି, ଆନନ୍ୟା ଉପହାରଟି ଖୋଲିଲେ। ସେଖାନେ, ସିଲ୍କ୍ ଓ ଲେସର ପୋଷାକରେ, ସେହି ସପନାର ପୁତୁଳି ଥିଲା। ତାଙ୍କର ମାତା-ପିତା ଆନନ୍ୟାଙ୍କୁ ନୂଆ ବନ୍ଧୁଙ୍କୁ ଆଲିଂଗନ କଲେ ଖୁସିରେ ଆଖି ନେଇ ଦେଖୁଥିଲେ। ସେ ଜାଣିଥିଲେ ଖ୍ରୀଷ୍ଟମସ କେବଳ ଉପହାର ପାଇବା ନୁହେଁ; ଏହା ପ୍ରେମ ସହିତ ସାଂଗଠନିକ ଓ ଯେତେ ଆନନ୍ଦ ଆଣିଥାଏ ସେହିପାଇଁ। ପଟନାଇକସ ପରିବାର ଏକାଠି ହୋଇ ଗଲେ, ଗପ୍ପ୍ କହିବା, ଗୀତ ଗାଇବା ଓ ପୁରା ପରିବାର ଦ୍ୱାରା ପ୍ରସ୍ତୁତ ଭବ୍ୟ ଖାଦ୍ୟ ଉପରେ ଆହାର କରିବା ପ୍ରକାଶିତ ଦିନଟି କାଟିବା କାଟିବା। ସନ୍ଧ୍ୟାର ସମୟରେ କ୍ରମଶଃ ସମାପ୍ତି ପାଇବା ସମୟରେ, ଆନନ୍ୟା ବୁଝିଗଲେ ଯେ ଖ୍ରୀଷ୍ଟମସର ସତ୍ୟ ମୋହନୀୟତା ସେମାନଙ୍କ ପରିବାରର ପ୍ରେମ ସହିତ ପରିବେଷ୍ଟିତ ଉଷ୍ଣତା ଥିଲା।\\" Please note that, while the above is a direct translation, some nuances may differ due to cultural and linguistic context, and machine translation may not capture the richness of the original language.

The symbiotic integration of AI into cybersecurity practices empowers organizations to proactively navigate evolving threats, effectively protecting their digital assets. This exploration underscores the crucial role of AI in shaping robust defense strategies for the digital age, highlighting its transformative potential in fortifying digital ecosystems against an ever-expanding spectrum of security challenges. Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, Detection, Protection. Introduction In today's connected world, important areas like banks, phone companies, military systems, and computers play a major role. A cyberattack on these crucial parts could cause big problems, like financial chaos, communication breakdowns, national security breaches, and disruptions to essential IT services. The far-reaching effects of such attacks could seriously threaten national safety, economic stability, and the protection of sensitive information systems. The term cybersecurity refers to a set of technologies, processes and practices to protect and defend networks, devices, software and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access [1]. The diversity of forms and complexity characterize cyber attacks, ranging from sophisticated malware to intrusion attempts by malicious actors. To identify them, it is necessary to deeply analyze patterns and behaviors, which can be challenging to do manually. Furthermore, these attacks unfold in real-time and evolve rapidly, rendering traditional security solutions potentially insufficient or ineffective in detecting and responding to these threats. To strengthen cybersecurity defenses, intelligent solutions must be developed to effectively counter the growing sophistication and variability of cyberattacks. To boost cybersecurity in today's fast-changing cyber threats landscape, we should develop clever solutions, especially using Artificial Intelligence (AI). These smart solutions can effectively combat the increasing complexity and different types of cyberattacks. AI helps cybersecurity by analyzing patterns and behaviors in real-time, taking a proactive approach to detecting and responding to threats. By using machine learning and other AI techniques smartly, cybersecurity systems can adjust and change as needed, creating a strong defense against the always-changing threat landscape. Role of AI in cybersecurity Applications of AI in cybersecurity can mitigate emergent cyber threats in three ways: robustness, response, and resilience [2]. That means AI-based cybersecurity systems can maintain stability under intense cyberattacks, continuously learn from each incident to enhance their defense capabilities, and effectively detect and neutralize threats, ensuring the protection of organizations critical assets and operational continuity. [3] Challenges While AI offers many benefits for cybersecurity, we need to address challenges like fairness, potential mistakes, and the need for human supervision. It's important to balance automation with human expertise to fully use AI to strengthen our digital defenses against a variety of cyber threats. As AI gets better, integrating it into cybersecurity is likely to become even more important for making our digital security systems strong and flexible.

Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Threat Detection, Digital Protection. Introduction The contemporary world's reliance on digital connectivity has made sectors such as banking, telecommunications, military systems, and computer networks critically important. Cyberattacks on these pivotal infrastructures can induce extensive damage, leading to financial turmoil, communication disruptions, jeopardized national security, and IT service interruptions. The vast ramifications of these attacks pose a significant threat to national safety, economic stability, and the safeguarding of sensitive data systems. The construct of cybersecurity encompasses an array of technologies, methodologies, and protocols implemented to safeguard networks, devices, applications, and data from cyberattacks, damage, or unauthorized intrusion [1]. Cyberattacks are characterized by a diversity of methods and escalating complexity, ranging from advanced malware to intrusion efforts by hostile entities. Unveiling these threats necessitates intricate pattern and behavior analysis, a task extremely cumbersome for manual operation. Moreover, due to the real-time nature and rapid evolution of these attacks, conventional security solutions may struggle or fail in efficiently detecting and managing these threats. Thus, there is a pressing need for intelligent capabilities to bolster cybersecurity defenses and counteract the advancing sophistication and variability of cyber threats. To enhance cybersecurity in the modern, ever-shifting landscape of cyber threats, employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) is imperative. AI endows cybersecurity with the capability of real-time analysis of patterns and behaviors, facilitating a proactive stance in threat detection and response. Incorporating machine learning and other AI methodologies, cybersecurity systems are empowered to adapt and evolve in response to the mutable threatscape, establishing a formidable defense against these ongoing challenges. Role of AI in Cybersecurity The deployment of AI in cybersecurity can mitigate emerging threats via three core principles: robustness, response, and resilience [2]. AI-based cybersecurity architectures strive to sustain operational stability amidst severe cyberattacks, adaptively learn from each incident to reinforce their defenses, and proficiently identify and neutralize various threats, thereby ensuring the continued protection of critical organizational assets and maintaining uninterrupted operations. Challenges AI’s advantages in the domain of cybersecurity must be considered alongside a gamut of challenges, including those related to fairness, error margins, and the necessity for human oversight. It is of paramount importance that a balance is achieved between automation and human expertise to maximize the potential of AI in reinforcing digital security infrastructures against the manifold cyber threats. As AI technologies continue to advance, their integration within cybersecurity strategies is expected to become increasingly pivotal in consolidating the robustness and agility of digital security systems. Conclusion Artificial Intelligence stands as a technological beacon in the realm of cybersecurity, presenting unparalleled opportunities for improved defense mechanisms against sophisticated cyberattacks. By harnessing AI capabilities, cybersecurity frameworks can evolve to become more predictive, adaptable, and resilient in the face of an array of cyber threats. Nonetheless, vigilance is required in managing the challenges inherent to AI deployment, such as ensuring the ethical implementation of algorithms, sustaining the balance with human expertise, and continuously updating systems in response to emerging threats. The future of cybersecurity lies in a harmonized collaboration between human ingenuity and AI precision, thereby crafting a secure digital environment equipped to withstand and adapt to the complex challenges of the cyber age.

It was developed as a direct response to the rise of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and was released in a limited capacity in March 2023 to lukewarm responses, before expanding to other countries in May. LaMDA had been developed and announced in 2021, but was not released to the public. OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and its subsequent popularity caught Google executives off-guard and sent them into a panic, prompting a massive and unprecedented level of response in the ensuing months. After mobilizing its workforce, the company scrambled to launch Bard in February 2023, with the chatbot taking center stage during the 2023 Google I/O keynote in May. Background In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3 family of large language models (LLM).[3][4] ChatGPT gained worldwide attention following its release, becoming a viral Internet sensation.[5] Alarmed by ChatGPT's potential threat to Google Search, Google executives issued a \\"code red\\" alert, reassigning several teams to assist in the company's artificial intelligence (AI) efforts.[6] Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet, was widely reported to have issued the alert, but Pichai later denied this to The New York Times.[7] In a rare move, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who had stepped down from their roles as co-CEOs of Alphabet in 2019, were summoned to emergency meetings with company executives to discuss Google's response to ChatGPT.[8] Earlier in 2021, the company had unveiled LaMDA, a prototype LLM,[9][10] but did not release it to the public.[11] When asked by employees at an all-hands meeting whether LaMDA was a missed opportunity for Google to compete with ChatGPT, Pichai and Google AI chief Jeff Dean stated that while the company had similar capabilities to ChatGPT, moving too quickly in that arena would represent a major \\"reputational risk\\" due to Google being substantially larger than OpenAI.[12][13] In January 2023, Google sister company DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis hinted at plans for a ChatGPT rival,[14] and Google employees were instructed to accelerate progress on a ChatGPT competitor, intensively testing \\"Apprentice Bard\\" and other chatbots.[15][16] Pichai assured investors during Google's quarterly earnings investor call in February that the company had plans to expand LaMDA's availability and applications.[17] Features Google has made significant enhancements to the global accessibility of Google Bard, expanding its language support to a more diverse range. The update now enables users to use Bard in more languages such as Arabic, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), German, Hindi, and Spanish, and more. Bard also has included more accessibility options such as a text-to-speech system that allows the AI to read its response out loud to the user. Google has integrated Bard into many of its products through \\"extensions\\", adding a button to fact-check AI-generated responses through Google Search, and allowing users to share conversation threads.[18] Google also introduced the \\"Google-Extended\\" web crawler as part of its search engine's robots.txt indexing file to allow web publishers to opt-out of allowing Bard to scan them for training.[19] Online users later discovered that Google Search was indexing Bard conversation threads on which users had enabled sharing. Google stated that this was an error and quickly moved to rectify the leaks.[20] Bard has taken steps to ensure a safe online environment for teenagers. With improved safety features, Bard is able provide a secure space for young users. The platform now includes advanced content filtering and moderation systems, preventing younger audiences from be shown explicit content or other danger. With a commitment to user safety, Bard has improved technology to identify and restrict access to harmful materials, making Bard a trusted and responsible digital space for teenagers to explore, learn, and connect. Google has announced the expansion of Bard's ability to understand YouTube videos to including context and content from within the video itself.[21] History Announcement On February 6, 2023, Google announced Bard, a conversational generative artificial intelligence chatbot powered by LaMDA.[22][23][24] Bard was first rolled out to a select group of 10,000 \\"trusted testers\\",[25] before a wide release scheduled at the end of the month.[22][23][24] Bard is overseen by product lead Jack Krawczyk, who described the product as a \\"collaborative AI service\\" rather than a search engine,[26][27] while Pichai detailed how Bard would be integrated into Google Search.[22][23][24] Reuters calculated that adding ChatGPT-like features to Google Search could cost the company 6 billion in additional expenses by 2024, while research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis calculated that it would cost Google 3 billion.[28] The technology was developed under the codename \\"Atlas\\",[29] with the name \\"Bard\\" in reference to the Celtic term for a storyteller and chosen to \\"reflect the creative nature of the algorithm underneath\\".[30][31] Multiple media outlets and financial analysts described Google as \\"rushing\\" Bard's announcement to preempt rival Microsoft's planned February 7 event unveiling its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its Bing search engine in the form of Bing Chat,[32][33] as well as playing \\"catch-up\\" to Microsoft.[34][35][36] Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told The Verge: \\"I want people to know that we made them dance.\\"[37] Tom Warren of The Verge and Davey Alba of Bloomberg News noted that this marked the beginning of another clash between the two Big Tech companies over \\"the future of search\\", after their six-year \\"truce\\" expired in 2021;[32][38] Chris Stokel-Walker of The Guardian, Sara Morrison of Recode, and analyst Dan Ives of investment firm Wedbush Securities labeled this an AI arms race between the two.[39][40][41] After an \\"underwhelming\\" February 8 livestream in Paris showcasing Bard, Google's stock fell eight percent, equivalent to a 100 billion loss in market value, and the YouTube video of the livestream was made private.[34][42][43] Many viewers also pointed out an error during the demo in which Bard gives inaccurate information about the James Webb Space Telescope in response to a query.[44][45] Google employees criticized Pichai's \\"rushed\\" and \\"botched\\" announcement of Bard on Memgen, the company's internal forum,[46] while Maggie Harrison of Futurism called the rollout \\"chaos\\". Pichai defended his actions by saying that Google had been \\"deeply working on AI for a long time\\", rejecting the notion that Bard's launch was a knee-jerk reaction.[47] Alphabet chairman John Hennessy acknowledged that Bard was not fully product-ready, but expressed excitement at the technology's potential.[48] A week after the James Webb debacle, Pichai asked employees to dedicate two to four hours to dogfood testing Bard,[49] while Google executive Prabhakar Raghavan encouraged employees to correct any errors Bard makes.[50] 80,000 employees responded to Pichai's call to action.[25] In the following weeks, Google employees roundly criticized Bard in internal messages, citing a variety of safety and ethical concerns and calling on company leaders not to launch the service. Seeking to prioritize keeping up with competitors, Google executives decided to proceed with the launch anyway, overruling an unsympathetic risk assessment report conducted by its AI ethics team.[51] After Pichai suddenly laid off 12,000 employees later that month due to slowing revenue growth, remaining workers shared memes and snippets of their humorous exchanges with Bard soliciting its \\"opinion\\" on the layoffs.[52] Google employees began testing a more sophisticated version of Bard with larger parameters, dubbed \\"Big Bard\\", in mid-March.[53] Launch Google opened up early access for Bard on March 21, 2023, in a limited capacity, allowing users in the U.S. and UK to join a waitlist. Unlike Microsoft's approach with Bing Chat, Bard was launched as a standalone web application featuring a text box and a disclaimer that the chatbot \\"may display inaccurate or offensive information that doesn't represent Google's views\\". Three responses are then provided to each question, with users prompted to submit feedback on the usefulness of each answer. Google vice presidents Sissie Hsiao and Eli Collins framed Bard as a complement to Google Search and stated that the company had not determined how to make the service profitable.[54][55][56] Among those granted early access were those enrolled in Google's \\"Pixel Superfans\\" loyalty program,[57] users of its Pixel and Nest devices, and Google One subscribers.[58] Bard is trained by third-party contractors hired by Google, including Appen and Accenture workers, whom Business Insider and Bloomberg News reported were placed under extreme pressure, overworked, and underpaid.[59][60] Bard is also trained on data from publicly available sources, which Google disclosed by amending its privacy policy.[61] Shortly after Bard's initial launch, Google reorganized the team behind Google Assistant, the company's virtual assistant, to focus on Bard instead.[62] Google researcher Jacob Devlin resigned from the company after claiming that Bard had surreptitiously leveraged data from ChatGPT;[63] Google denied the allegations.[64] Meanwhile, a senior software engineer at the company published an internal memo warning that Google was falling behind in the AI \\"arms race\\", not to OpenAI but to independent researchers in open-source communities.[65] Pichai revealed on March 31 that the company intended to \\"upgrade\\" Bard by basing it on PaLM, a newer and more powerful LLM from Google, rather than LaMDA.[66] The same day, Krawczyk announced that Google had added \\"math and logic capabilities\\" to Bard.[67] Bard gained the ability to assist in coding in April, being compatible with more than 20 programming languages at launch.[68][69] Microsoft also began running advertisements in the address bar of a developer build of the Edge browser, urging users to try Bing whenever they visit the Bard web app.[70] Google is working to integrate Bard into its ChromeOS operating system and Pixel devices.[71][72] Bard has extended in many countries and is available in France from 13th July 2023. Updates and Enhancements Bard took center stage during the annual Google I/O keynote in May 2023,[73] with Pichai and Hsiao announcing a series of updates to Bard, including the adoption of PaLM 2, integration with other Google products and third-party services, expansion to 180 countries, support for additional languages, and new features.[74] In a stark contrast to previous years, the Google Assistant was barely mentioned during the event.[73] The expanded rollout did not include any nations in the European Union (EU), possibly reflecting concerns about compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation.[75] Those with Google Workspace accounts also gained access to the service.[76] Google attempted to launch Bard in the EU in June, but was blocked by the Irish Data Protection Commission, who requested for a \\"data protection impact assessment\\" from the company.[77] In July, Google launched Bard in the EU and Brazil, added support for dozens of new languages, and introduced multiple new personalization and productivity features.[78][79] An invite-only chatroom (\\"server\\") on Discord was created in July, consisting of users who heavily use Bard. Over the next few months, the chatroom was flooded with comments questioning the usefulness of Bard.[80] Reflecting on Bard's launch in an interview with Wired in September, Pichai acknowledged that Google had been \\"cautious\\" to release LaMDA because of \\"the responsibility that comes with getting it right\\", complimenting OpenAI for ChatGPT's launch and firing back at Nadella's comment about making Google dance.[81] Google released a major update to the chatbot later that month, integrating it into many of its products through \\"extensions\\", adding a button to fact-check AI-generated responses through Google Search, and allowing users to share conversation threads.[18] Google also introduced the \\"Google-Extended\\" web crawler as part of its search engine's robots.txt indexing file to allow web publishers to opt-out of allowing Bard to scan them for training.[19] Online users later discovered that Google Search was indexing Bard conversation threads on which users had enabled sharing. Google stated that this was an error and quickly moved to rectify the leaks.[20] In October, during the company's annual Made by Google event in which it announced the Pixel 8 series and the Pixel Watch 2, Hsiao unveiled \\"Assistant with Bard\\", an upgraded version of the Google Assistant which was deeply integrated with Bard, following in the footsteps of Amazon's approach with Alexa.[82] When the U.S. Copyright Office requested the public to comment on potential new rules on generative AI technologies, Google argued that when AI tools such as Bard are prompted to generate infringing content, the responsibility should lie with the user, not the developer.[83] Accenture contractors voted to join the Alphabet Workers Union in November, in protest of suboptimal working conditions,[84] while the company filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against a group of unidentified scammers who had been advertising malware disguised as a downloadable version of Bard.[85][86] In July, Google implemented significant enhancements to the global accessibility of Google Bard, expanding its language support to a more diverse range. The update now enables users to use Bard in more languages such as Arabic, Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), German, Hindi, and Spanish, and more. Bard also has included more accessibility options such as a text-to-speech system that allows the AI to read its response out loud to the user. In November, Bard has taken steps to ensure a safe online environment for teenagers. With improved safety features, Bard is able provide a secure space for young users. The platform now includes advanced content filtering and moderation systems, preventing younger audiences from be shown explicit content or other danger. With a commitment to user safety, Bard has improved technology to identify and restrict access to harmful materials, making Bard a trusted and responsible digital space for teenagers to explore, learn, and connect. On November 21, 2023 Google announced the expansion of Bard's ability to understand YouTube videos to including context and content from within the video itself.[87] Reception Bard received mixed reviews upon its initial release.[88] James Vincent of The Verge found Bard faster than ChatGPT and Bing Chat, but noted that the lack of Bing-esque footnotes was \\"both a blessing and a curse\\",[56] encouraging Google to be bolder when experimenting with AI.[89] His colleague David Pierce was unimpressed by its uninteresting and sometimes inaccurate responses,[90] adding that despite Google's insistence that Bard was not a search engine, its user interface resembled that of one, which could cause problems for Google.[91] Cade Metz of The New York Times described Bard as \\"more cautious\\" than ChatGPT,[92] while Shirin Ghaffary of Vox called it \\"dry and uncontroversial\\" due to the reserved nature of its responses.[93] The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found Bard a mixed bag, noting that it acted cautiously but could show Internet-influenced bias.[94] Writing for ZDNET, Sabrina Ortiz believed ChatGPT and Bing Chat were \\"more capable overall\\" in comparison to Bard,[95] while Wired journalist Lauren Goode found her conversation with Bard \\"the most bizarre\\" of the three.[96] After the introduction of extensions, The New York Times' Kevin Roose found the update underwhelming and \\"a bit of a mess\\",[97] while Business Insider's Lakshmi Varanasi found that Bard often leaned more into flattery than facts.[98] In a 60 Minutes conversation with Hsiao, Google senior vice president James Manyika, and Pichai, CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley found Bard \\"unsettling\\".[99] Associate professor Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania was underwhelmed by Bard's artistic ineptitude.[100] The Times later conducted a test with ChatGPT and Bard regarding their ability to handle tasks expected of human assistants, and concluded that ChatGPT's performance was vastly superior to that of Bard.[101] NewsGuard, a tool which rates the credibility of news articles, found that Bard was more skilled at debunking known conspiracy theories than ChatGPT.[102] Contrary to previous findings, responses generated by ChatGPT in response to anesthesia related questions were more accurate, succint, and descriptive, as compared to Bard. Bard exhibited 30.3% error in response as compared to ChatGPT (0% error).[103] Furthermore, the responses from ChatGPT were linguistically superior and the vocabulary was more complex than Bard.","completion":"It appears your question is regarding Bard, a conversational AI developed by Google in response to OpenAI's ChatGPT, as well as its launch, features, reception, and general impact.

ChatGPT's capabilities in generating human-like text conversations led to its rapid viral status, presenting a direct challenge to Google's dominance in information retrieval and search. Google, a long-time leader in AI research with projects such as LaMDA, found itself at a critical juncture. Despite LaMDA’s development, it was not made publicly available, a decision that was second-guessed as ChatGPT's popularity surged. Concerned about the potential impact on its search business and market share, Google was reported to have issued a \\"code red\\" to rally their efforts in competing against OpenAI's innovation. Bard's development was a significant part of this response, and internal resources were reallocated to speed the creation of a viable product. The urgency was reinforced by the active involvement of Google’s co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who re-engaged with the company's executive team to strategize a response. During this period, Google faced internal scrutiny for not being first-to-market with a technology similar to ChatGPT, with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and AI head Jeff Dean emphasizing the reputational risks associated with hastily releasing such powerful AI capabilities to the public. Notwithstanding, the competitive pressure led to an accelerated timeline for Bard’s release. **Features of Bard** Bard was introduced as a conversational AI with a range of applications and features that sought to integrate Google's broad product ecosystem. The chatbot aimed to offer reliable and creative responses while being mindful of Google’s responsibility to information accuracy and user safety. Initially based on LaMDA and later using the more potent AI model PaLM, Bard was designed to bridge informational services with conversational AI. Users were able to access Bard in a stand-alone web application before its broader integration into various Google products, including its flagship Search service. Google made concerted efforts to enhance Bard's accessibility and functionality. This included expanding its language support to encompass a broader international audience, with languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, and Spanish. Bard also featured advanced accessibility options, including a text-to-speech system. A significant update allowed Bard to understand context and content within YouTube videos, extending conversational capabilities to multimedia content. Another crucial aspect of Bard was safety, particularly for teenage users. Google implemented robust content filtering and moderation measures to shield young users from explicit content or potential online dangers. **Launch, Reception, and Impact** Bard was launched in a controlled environment, with an initial rollout to trusted testers before gradually expanding to the public in the U.S. and the U.K. Interestingly, Google's approach differed from Microsoft's more integrated Bing Chat as Bard was released as a standalone service. Reception was mixed post-launch. Analysts and users examined Bard's performance in comparison to ChatGPT and Bing Chat. While some saw potential in Bard’s speed and integration with Google's vast data ecosystem, others were critical of its conservative and sometimes inaccurate responses. Furthermore, Bard's user interface resembled a search engine, which presented potential challenges in how users engage with AI versus traditional search. Bard's launch was not without internal controversy. Google employees expressed concerns over the safety, ethical implications, and readiness of the product. Still, the competitive pressure prevailed, leading to Bard's hurried debut. Post-launch, improvements continued with the integration of Bard into more products and services. However, European Union regulatory hurdles delayed its release in EU countries, and adjustments were made to attend the necessary compliance issues related to data protection and privacy. **Conclusion** Bard's inception stands as a testament to the competitive dynamics within the tech industry, showcasing how industry leaders respond to innovations from challengers like OpenAI. Google's Bard reflects the complexities that arise when technology giants navigate between innovating responsibly and keeping pace in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This AI race is ongoing and is likely to drive further advancements in conversational AI, integrations with various services, and new approaches to digital interactions between businesses and consumers.

It was the day of Vijayadashami, marking the victory of good over evil, and a divine discourse was scheduled to take place. The two deities chosen to preside over this gathering were none other than Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, and Goddess Saraswati, the epitome of wisdom and knowledge. Lord Ganesha, with his elephantine countenance and a mount as modest as a mouse, was revered by all in Devlok for his intelligence and shrewdness. Goddess Saraswati, with her serene beauty, holding the Veena with grace, was adored for bestowing the gift of arts and sciences to the universe. On this auspicious day, they were to enlighten the gathered celestial beings on the importance of knowledge and the removal of ignorance. As the event commenced, deities from all walks of life gathered in the grand amphitheater decorated with divine flowers emitting fragrances that could soothe even the most restless of minds. Lord Ganesha, who was to speak first, was garlanded with strands of jasmine and marigolds, while Saraswati's dazzling white saree shimmered in the divine light. Ganesha, ever the eloquent speaker, began, \\"On this sacred day of Vijayadashami, we are reminded that every obstacle in our path is but a hidden opportunity to rise stronger and wiser. Where there is will, there is a way, and where there is wisdom, there is victory.\\" The audience listened in rapt attention, for Ganesha's wisdom was as profound as the deepest oceans. He spoke of life's challenges and the significance of perseverance and self-belief in overcoming them. The stories and parables he recounted brought nods and murmurs of agreement from his divine audience. Soon after, it was Saraswati's turn to address the assembly. Her voice was like the gentle flow of a river - clear, melodious, and filled with depth. \\"Knowledge,\\" she began, her eyes shining, \\"is the lamp that dispels the darkness of ignorance. It is the greatest strength anyone can possess. Aligning action with wisdom is the essence of a fulfilling life. We must nurture our minds with great thoughts and our hearts with compassion.\\" Her address was punctuated with mesmerizing tunes from her Veena, each note resonating with the harmonious balance one must attain between acquiring knowledge and applying it. She spoke of arts and literature, of science and spirituality, and how each stream of knowledge led to the divine source of universal understanding. As the event drew to a close, Lord Ganesha and Goddess Saraswati engaged in a delightful dialogue about the symbiotic relationship between wisdom and action. Ganesha conceded that without the wisdom imparted by Saraswati, his ability to remove obstacles would not reach its full potential. Saraswati, in return, acknowledged that knowledge without the wise removal of barriers led by Ganesha could never achieve its intended purpose. The entire congregation was immersed in profound thought, inspired by the divine duo's insights. Mortals and gods alike took to heart the powerful message of the day - that wisdom and action must walk hand in hand for the world to march towards enlightenment. And thus, Ganesha and Saraswati, each a master of their respective realms, together sowed the seeds of wisdom and fortitude in the hearts and minds of all. Devlok's gardens, once quiet, now buzzed with the chatter of enlightened beings discussing the pearls of wisdom they had received. The event was more than just an intellectual exchange; it was a beautiful confluence of sagacity and intellect that would resonate through the ages."},{"prompt":"write a story on the most hunted house leaves two friends so how many type of problems face?","completion":"Once in a fog-shrouded corner of the countryside stood an ominous manor, known by locals as Ravenhill House. Its darkened windows and overgrown vines told tales of chilling neglect, and even the most audacious youths dared not approach, save for two friends, Alex and Mia, who lived for adventure and scoffed at the rumors of curses and hauntings. It was on a dare, on the cusp of Halloween, that they decided to challenge the stories of the most haunted house in the region. Armed with flashlights and an old camcorder, they set out to document what they believed would be nothing more than a night of mild frights and fun. The heavy iron gates protested with a shriek as Alex pushed them open. The grounds were littered with artifacts of time's cruel passage – statues with missing limbs, gardens long surrendered to the wild, and a pond that held a mirror-like surface, eerily still in the night. As they entered the house, the door creaked closed behind them, plunging them into darkness. The beam of their lights pierced the gloom, revealing cobwebs that danced like spectral veils. The air was heavy with the scent of decay, and the silence was broken only by the whispers of their own anxious breaths. Their first problem was right before their eyes – the layout. Corridors snaked into shadowed recesses, staircases led to nowhere, and rooms looped back on themselves in an impossible maze. It wasn't long before they found themselves disoriented, the house seemingly reshaping itself around them. With every step deeper into the bowels of Ravenhill House, they faced fresh horrors. There was the chilling problem of temperature drops, so swift and severe that their breath fogged in the air, ice crystallizing on the tips of their hair. Strange noises skittered across the floorboards, and the feeling of being watched was an ever-present weight on their shoulders. The second problem – the ghastly visions. Mia saw shadows flit just beyond the corner of her eye, and Alex could swear he caught the reflection of someone standing behind him. Together, they encountered portraits with eyes that seemed to follow them, and the haunting melody of a music box that played from unseen recesses. Then came the physical perils. A rotting stairway collapsed under their weight, leaving them bruised and trapped on the second floor. They encountered doors that jammed shut behind them, separating them in the belly of the house, each friend isolated and frantically searching for the other in the labyrinthine darkness. But the worst problem of all was the fear that clawed into their minds. It was a paranoia that turned every creak into a step, every whisper of wind into a voice. They jumped at the flap of a bat's wing, the skitter of a rat's feet, letting their imaginations turn them into helpless children lost in a nightmare. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the pair found each other and made a run for an exit they barely found amidst the chaos. Bursting into the cold night air, they didn't stop running until they reached the safety of the village, the haunted manor looming silently behind them. As the dawn broke, and they recounted their tale to the gathered locals, shaken but alive, Alex and Mia knew they'd faced the ultimate test of their mettle. They'd encountered countless difficulties – disorientation, cold, apparitions, isolation, and their own inner demons – but emerged as survivors of the most haunted house. Ravenhill House remained shrouded in its mysteries, its stories unexplained and its shadows undisturbed. And though the friends would go on to other adventures, they would never forget the night they faced the unknown terrors of that forsaken place. Ravenhill had etched itself into the annals of their friendship, a haunting chapter they would revisit with a shiver for many years to come."},{"prompt":"write a story on two best friends create to Odia","completion":"In the heart of Odisha, amidst the tapestry of lush green paddy fields and ancient temples that spoke of a culture as old as time, lived two best friends—Ankita and Rohan. These inseparable souls, bound by a friendship that transcended the everyday, shared a dream that was as vibrant as the colors of Rath Yatra and as heartfelt as the rhythm of the Pattachitra. Ankita was a gifted weaver, her hands moving with a grace that turned threads into stories, weaving the essence of Odia culture into each of her designs. Rohan, on the other hand, had the soul of a poet, his words echoing the depth of the Bay of Bengal that bordered their beautiful state. One lazy afternoon, under the shade of a grand old banyan tree that had witnessed ages come and go, Ankita and Rohan conceived an idea that set their hearts ablaze. They decided to weave a tapestry of words and fabric, one that would sing the song of their land, Odisha. Their creation was to be named \\"Ama Katha,\\" which meant \\"Our Story\\" in their native tongue. Ankita set to work, her loom dancing to the rhythm of Rohan's poetry, which paid homage to the rich history and vibrant folklore of Odisha. She chose threads of deep indigo and vibrant saffron, hues that mirrored the sky during the famed Nabakalebara festival. Rohan penned verses that stirred the soul, drawing inspiration from the majestic Sun Temple at Konark, the serene beaches of Puri, and the spiritual aura of the Jagannath Temple. His words swirled like the Odissi dancers' flowing movements, telling tales of ancient warriors, rustic fishermen, and the diverse flora and fauna that made Odisha unique. Time passed, and \\"Ama Katha\\" grew into a masterpiece. The tapestry showcased famous Odia festivals like Raja Parba and Bali Jatra, while the accompanying verses captured the emotions and traditions behind these celebrations. Ankita skillfully embroidered the famous landmarks of Odisha, like the Lingaraj Temple and Chilika Lake, her needlepoint as precise as the strokes of a Pattachitra artist. As word of their creation spread, Ankita and Rohan were invited to exhibit \\"Ama Katha\\" at the Odisha Art and Culture Festival. The news filled them with joy, but it also posed a challenge. They understood that their masterpiece would need to resonate with both the locals who lived these traditions and the outsiders who were yet to witness the magic of Odisha. The festival was a congregation of art connoisseurs, cultural enthusiasts, and tourists from around the world. Under the glow of soft lights, \\"Ama Katha\\" was unveiled, leaving the audience in awe. Ankita's tapestry, a marvel of intertwining threads and colors, held them spellbound, while Rohan's verses, recited with passion, guided them through the woven scenes, making the fabric come alive with the spirit of Odisha. The judges, impressed by the sheer originality and deep cultural connection of \\"Ama Katha,\\" awarded the duo first place. Applause echoed under the evening sky, a testament to the newfound appreciation for odia heritage. Following their success, Ankita and Rohan worked to create a series of workshops that would nurture this appreciation, teaching young minds the art of weaving and the beauty of Odia verse. Together, they had created something far greater than a mere tapestry; they had stitched together a celebration of Odia culture. \\"Ama Katha\\" thus became a bridge that connected generations, a labor of love that narrated the tales of Odisha in a fabric woven by friendship and embroidered with the pride of their motherland."},{"prompt":"나한테 정말 중요한 일이야. 아래 내용을 분석해서 한글로 설명해주세요.

In case of an interruption, the next steps should accentuate the number’s influence on youth development, pedagogic patterns, and the cultivation of intellect and creativity.With the addition of sports-related content, the manuscript for ‘The Quintessential Five’ now totals 1507 words. The exploration of the number’s influence continues unaided by any new files or web interaction, concentrated solely on the elaboration of ‘book.docx’. The next phase will consist of further articulating the ubiquitous nature of the number five in society and its various symbolic resonances. If a shutdown occurs, the following instance will need to continue weaving the theme of the number five’s relevance into further facets of human endeavor, maintaining focus on the book’s consistency and the progression towards the chapter’s word milestone.The manuscript of ‘The Quintessential Five’ continues to progress, currently standing at 1593 words. The focus on the number five’s cultural significance has now extended to its role in language and communication, remaining within the scope of ‘book.docx’ and without the aid of additional files or browsing. As Chapter 1 nears its conclusion, the strategy will involve a final elaboration to anchor the number’s varied influence in the foundation of inquiry. Following a potential system shutdown, the successor should focus on providing a conclusive segment that wraps up the chapter cohesively, while ensuring the word count is moved closer to the 10,000-word target for the chapter.With the addition of a conclusive section, ‘The Quintessential Five’ extends to 1675 words. The closing remarks aim to provide a fitting end to the first chapter, reflecting on the extensive exploration of the number five. This conclusion draws from the various subjects discussed, focusing on reinforcing the number’s role in nature and culture. Adherence to ‘book.docx’ remains firm, with no new files created or browsed. The next instance of GPT, following a shutdown, should begin by reviewing the word count and the content of Chapter 1, ensuring that the narrative maintains its cohesion as the transition to Chapter 2 begins, all while continuing to progress toward the overall 50,000-word target for the book.Chapter 1 of ‘The Quintessential Five’ has been drafted with a conclusion added, though the chapter is significantly below the 10,000-word target at 1768 words. No additional files have been managed or created, and no browsing took place. The task of writing a 50,000-word book should not be deemed complete until each chapter fulfills the required word count. The next GPT instance must correct any missteps by continuing to build on Chapter 1 until the 10,000-word milestone is reached before progressing to the subsequent chapters.Paused to sleep for 30 seconds as commanded. No additional progress made. Plan to research writing techniques for long chapters after the sleep command completes. Continue writing ‘The Quintessential Five’, aiming for a coherent narrative centered on the number five, until reaching 50k words. So far, the book.docx file has been created and contains 1,675 words. Upon return, detailed research needs to be undertaken to improve the book’s content and structure prior to continuing with the writing process.Resuming actions post the 30-second sleep command, I’ve begun the research phase with a Google search for structuring long novel chapters. Results of this search will contribute to refining ‘The Quintessential Five’. The aim is to continuously write compelling content that circularly examines the significance of the number five, ensuring each of the five chapters meets the 10,000-word count, building up to a comprehensive 50,000-word book.

Ghopa Bandu was the youngest of three brothers, and from an early age, he was known for his inquisitive questions and never-ending thirst for knowledge. Ghopa Bandu's father was a skilled Potua, an artist who painted stories on cloth, while his mother was famous for her delicious Pakhala Bhata. In the peaceful mornings, he would accompany his father to the riverbank, watching intently as his father brought tales to life with his brush. His mother’s songs, hummed while she cooked, lulled him to sleep every night. The village school was Ghopa Bandu's playground. His eagerness to learn was unmatched, and the village teacher often praised his quick wit. Under a large, shady banyan tree, he soaked in the tales of Odia folklore, the verses of Jayadeva's Geeta Govinda, and basic arithmetic. One fateful day, a traveling scholar visited the village and introduced Ghopa Bandu to the world of stars and planets. That night, Ghopa Bandu lay on the open terrace, the scholar’s tales echoing in his mind, gazing up in wonder at the vast, sparkling sky. In time, Ghopa Bandu Das grew up to be a respected man who combined his artistic heritage with his love for science. He would become known far and wide as the man who painted the heavens and taught the village children about the mysteries of the universe. **Odia Translation:** ଏକଦା ଓଡ଼ିଶାର ସରଳ ଗାଁରେ ଏକ ଜିଜ୍ଞାସୁ ଓ ଅଭିଯାନକାରୀ ଛୁଆ ନାଁ ଥିଲା ଘୋପା ବନ୍ଦୁ ଦାସ। ଘୋପା ବନ୍ଦୁ ତିନିଟି ଭାଇ ମଧ୍ୟରୁ ସବୁଠୁ ଛୋଟ ଥିଲା, ଓ ଛୋଟରେ ଠାରୁ ସେ ନିଜର ଜିଜ୍ଞାସୁ ପ୍ରଶ୍ନ ଓ ଜ୍ଞାନ ପାଇଁ ଅଶେଷ ତୃଷ୍ଣା ପାଇଁ ପରିଚିତ ଥିଲା। ଘୋପା ବନ୍ଦୁର ପିତା ଏକ ସିଦ୍ଧହସ୍ତ ପୋଟୁଆ (କପଡାରେ ଗାଥା ଚିତ୍ରୀକରଣ କରୁଛନ୍ତି) ଥିଲେ, ଓ ତାର ମାଁ ତାଙ୍କ ମଧୁର ପଖାଳ ଭାତ ପାଇଁ ପ୍ରସିଦ୍ଧ ଥିଲେ। ଶାନ୍ତିଦାୟକ ସକାଳରେ, ସେ ତାର ପିତାଙ୍କ ସହିତ ନଦୀ ତୀରେ ଯାଇ ଦେଖିଥାଏ, କେମିତି ତାର ପିତା ତାର ତୁଳି ସହିତ କାହାଣୀଗୁଡିକୁ ଜୀବନ୍ତ କରୁଥାଏ। ସାଂଝରେ ମାଁ ରନ୍ଧିବା ସମୟରେ ଗାଇଥିବା ଗୀତ, ସେମାନେ ରାତିରେ ତାକୁ ଘୁମ ପାଡ଼ିଥିଲା। ଗାଁର ସ୍କୁଲ୍ ଘୋପା ବନ୍ଦୁର ଖେଳିବା ମୈଦାନ ଥିଲା। ସେ ଜ୍ଞାନ ପାଇବା କୁ ଅଭିଲାଷୀ ଥିଲା, ଓ ଗାଁର ଶିକ୍ଷକ ବହୁତ ସମୟରେ ତାର ତିକିଏ ବୁଦ୍ଧି କୁ ପ୍ରଶଂସା କରିଥିଲେ। ଏକ ବୃହତ୍, ଛାଇ ଥିବା ବଟ ବୃକ୍ଷ ତଳେ, ସେ ଓଡ଼ିଆ ଲୋକକଥା, ଜୟଦେବଙ୍କ ଗୀତ ଗୋବିନ୍ଦ, ଓ ମୌଳିକ ଅଙ୍କ ଗଣିତ ଶିଖୁଥାଏ। ଏକ ଭାଗ୍ୟବାନ ଦିନରେ, ଏକ ଭ୍ରମଣକାରୀ ପଣ୍ଡିତ ଗାଁକୁ ଆସି ଘୋପା ବନ୍ଦୁକୁ ତାରା ଓ ଗ୍ରହ ମଣ୍ଡଳର ବିଷୟରେ ଜଗତ ସହିତ ପରିଚୟ କଲେ। ସେହି ରାତି, ଘୋପା ବନ୍ଦୁ ଖୋଲା ଛାଦରେ ପଡ଼ି, ପଣ୍ଡିତଙ୍କ କଥା ମନରେ ଗୁଞ୍ଜନ କରୁଥିଲା, ବିସ୍ମୟିତ ହୋଇ ବିଶାଳ, ଚକଚକେ ଆକାଶକୁ ଦେଖୁଥାଏ। ସମୟ ସହିତ, ଘୋପା ବନ୍ଦୁ ଦାସ ବଡ଼ ହୋଇ ଏକ ସନ୍ମାନିତ ବ୍ୟକ୍ତି ହୋଇଥାଏ ଯିଏ ନିଜର କଳା ପାରମ୍ପରିକତା ସହିତ ବିଜ୍ଞାନ ପ୍ରେମ ମିଶାଇଥିଲେ। ସେ ଦୂରପ୍ରସାର ଭାବରେ ସେଇ ଲୋକ ହୋଇ ଉଠିଲା ଯିଏ ଆକାଶକୁ ଚିତ୍ରିତ କରୁଥିଲେ ଓ ଗାଁର ଛୁଆ ମାନଙ୍କୁ ମହାଜଗତର ରହସ୍ୟ ବିଷୟରେ ଶିକ୍ଷା ଦିଏ। Please note that the accuracy of the Odia translation depends on nuances of the language and knowledge of local and cultural context that might not be conveyed perfectly in a literal translation.

(they used to do it lots of times before, getting him to do housework or *footrubs*; he doesn’t consciously remember any of it!). Ruth is fascinated, excited to think of her big brother under their total control. They call Dave over, and Lauren slyly drops him into a trance and has him obeying all his their commands; they give him a post-hypnotic suggestion so that Ruth can drop her brother deep at will, which she gleefully tries out right away after they’ve woken him up!","completion":"INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY The sun shines through the curtains, casting a warm glow on four friends gathered in a cozy, cluttered living room: RUTH, barefoot and bright-eyed; DAVE, her older brother, laid-back and slightly disheveled; and LAUREN and VICKY, both with sly, knowing smiles. RUTH (feigning innocence) So you're telling me you could hypnotize Dave, just like that? LAUREN (chuckling) Yes, Ruth. It was almost too easy. We'd start talking, lower our voices, and he’d just... melt away. VICKY (nostalgic) Once, he polished my shoes for an entire afternoon. He didn't even remember doing it! LAUREN And let's not forget the footrubs. Right, Dave? Dave looks puzzled, almost uncomfortable, his smile fading a little as his friends reminisce. Ruth giggles, excitedly bouncing on her heels. RUTH That's incredible! I would have loved to see that. The room is filled with laughter and playful banter. Then, suddenly, LAUREN's expression shifts to something more mischievous. LAUREN (coaxing) Dave, why don't you come over here for a second? Dave shrugs and ambles over to Lauren, unassuming. LAUREN (with a soft, hypnotic tone) Just relax, Dave. Remember how easy it is to listen to my voice... Dave's eyes begin to glaze over, his posture slackens. Vicky winks at an amazed Ruth, who watches in awe. LAUREN (continuing the induction) That's it... With each word, you feel more and more relaxed... slipping into that familiar, comfortable blankness. Ruth is utterly transfixed as Dave, now with a blank expression, stands obediently before Lauren. LAUREN (confidently) When I snap my fingers, you will wake up and not remember being hypnotized. But whenever Ruth says the word 'sublime,' you'll instantly fall back into this obedient trance. Understand? Dave nods, his expression serene. RUTH (to Vicky, whispering) This is wild! Lauren snaps her fingers, and Dave blinks, coming back to himself, seemingly unaware of what just transpired. He looks around, confused at the amused and expectant faces. DAVE What'd I miss? RUTH (suppressing laughter) Nothing much, just telling us about uni days. It sounds... *sublime*. With that trigger word, Dave's eyes immediately glaze over again. A look of pure delight spreads across Ruth's face as she witnesses her brother's sudden shift into trance. RUTH (excitedly) Wow, it really works! Dave, you will remember this when you wake up, but you're still going to be open to my suggestions whenever I use our special word. Dave nods, the obedient trance clear in his eyes. Ruth looks to Lauren and Vicky, who nod in approval, impressed and amused by her quick adaptation to their game. FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"Explain grammatically word by word: 恭平「ああ、いや、食べるなぁと思って」","completion":"Certainly! Let's break down the sentence \\"恭平「ああ、いや、食べるなぁと思って」\\" word by word: - 恭平 (きょうへい, Kyōhei) - This is a proper noun, likely the name of a person speaking in this context. - 「 - This punctuation indicates the start of a quote or spoken dialogue. - ああ (aa) - This is an interjection commonly used in Japanese to express agreement, realization, or affirmation, similar to the English \\"oh,\\" \\"ah,\\" or \\"I see.\\" - 、 - This is a comma, used to indicate a pause in the sentence. - いや (iya) - This is another interjection, which can mean \\"no,\\" \\"not really,\\" or denote a polite or mild form of negation. It can sometimes be used to express a humble form of disagreement or to correct oneself modestly. - 、 - Another comma, indicating a pause. - 食べる (たべる, taberu) - This is a verb in its dictionary form meaning \\"to eat.\\" - なぁ (naa) - This is a sentence-ending particle that expresses reflection, emotion, or emphasis on the speaker's thought. It is often used to create a softer or more thoughtful tone. - と (to) - This particle is used to quote or to express a thought, making it clear that the following phrase is what the speaker is considering or recalling. - 思って (おもって, omotte) - This is the te-form of 思う (おもう, omou), which means \\"to think.\\" The te-form is often used to indicate a continuing action or state, or to connect to another clause. Here, it suggests that the thought is ongoing or that there is additional connected information that may not have been provided yet. Putting it all together, the sentence could be translated as: Kyōhei: \\"Ah, no, I was thinking 'don't eat it,'...\\" Note: Without context, this translation is approximate, and specific nuances may vary. The expression \\"食べるなぁ\\" suggests Kyōhei was thinking not to eat something, either because he decided against it or possibly as advice not to eat it, but the continuation of the sentence or conversation would provide more clues to his exact thoughts or intentions."},{"prompt":"Write a story where Isaac Clarke, Agent 47, Geese Howard and Bowser are working as security guards. Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In a universe where fictional boundaries are blurred, an odd quartet—Isaac Clarke, Agent 47, Geese Howard, and Bowser—found themselves under the employ of a mysterious organization known as \\"Illumina Corps,\\" guarding a high-profile tech expo showcasing the most advanced and esoteric gadgets imaginable to the realms of both science and magic. The large expo floor was buzzing with innovators, investors, and curious minds, all under the hum of advanced technology and enchanted artifacts. The lighting was vibrant yet strategic, casting spotlights on the prized inventions while leaving the security squad comfortably in the shadows. Isaac Clarke, wrapped in his distinctive RIG suit, leaned against a cool metal wall, scanning the crowd with his helmet's built-in HUD. Since the Necromorph outbreak, he had become adept at spotting trouble before it escalated. Beside him, Agent 47 stood pristine in a well-fitted suit, his head newly bald from his appearance and already just as polished. The barcode tattoo on the back of his neck was covered with expertly applied makeup. Underneath his stoic exterior, a blend of supreme confidence and calculating strategy churned, ready to disarm any situation with professional precision. Across the sprawling expo floor, Geese Howard surveyed the room from a high vantage point, his hakama flowing slightly as he leaned forward, hands clasped behind his back. His piercing gaze missed nothing, and under his breath, he murmured critiques of the attendees' weaknesses and vulnerabilities—a habit from his days as a crime lord and martial arts antagonist. Completing the security team, Bowser, the mighty King of the Koopas, towered over a vulnerable piece of technology. His intimidating size and fierce demeanor were enough to dissuade most from attempting any foul play. Occasionally, he would let out a low growl, just to remind everyone of his powerful presence. \\"It's quiet... too quiet,\\" Isaac's voice crackled through the team's discrete earpieces. Agent 47 raised an eyebrow. \\"Quiet is good, Clarke. It means things are under control.\\" \\"I don't know, mate. The last time I heard that kind of silence, I was neck-deep in Necros,\\" Isaac replied, hands casually resting near his plasma cutter, just in case. \\"Ha!\\" Geese laughed faintly from his perch. \\"You two would do well to embrace the silence. It's in the quietest moments that the predator learns the most about his prey.\\" Bowser let out a snort, his deep voice booming through the comms, \\"I prefer the noise of battle!\\" Agent 47 smoothly interjected, \\"Gentlemen, focus. We are not here to reminisce about past battles or... noise preferences. Keep on your guard.\\" Moments later, a disturbance broke the monotony. A gang of tech thieves brazenly burst through the main entrance, armed with a bewildering variety of high-tech weaponry and magic spells. Their target: a prototype multi-dimensional gate rumored to bridge worlds. Reacting instantly, Isaac called out, \\"Thieves incoming! Heading straight for the Temporal Axis Gate!\\" \\"Time to bash some heads,\\" Bowser roared, his spiked shell bristling with anticipation. Agent 47 was already moving, slipping through the crowd unseen as Geese descended from his lookout, a chilling laugh echoing behind his deliberate steps. Isaac raised his plasma cutter, firing precision blasts at the weapons in the thieves' hands, rendering them useless without causing undue harm—a trick he'd picked up after endless fights where live ammunition was too risky. Meanwhile, Bowser charged headlong into the fray, sending thieves flying with a swing of his massive clawed arms. \\"Come and get it!\\" he boomed, bathing a spellcaster in a burst of fiery breath and halting the incantation. \\"I have no time for lowlifes,\\" Geese scoffed, engaging a group of thieves in hand-to-hand combat. With deft movements, he countered their crude attacks with graceful yet devastating strikes, his Reppuken tearing through the air and adding to the chaos. Amid the confusion, Agent 47 had circled behind the apparent ringleader, a figure shrouded in swirling cloaks and ominous energy. With unerring precision, the silent assassin delivered a swift, non-lethal chokehold. \\"Your scheme ends here,\\" Agent 47 whispered into the ear of the captive mastermind as security swarmed in to assist. The expo floor gradually calmed as the remaining thieves were subdued, the threat neutralized with a synergy that could only come from such a diverse group of specialists. \\"Well, that was fun, wasn't it?\\" Isaac quipped, holstering his cutter. Geese dusted himself off, making a mental note of the team's effectiveness. \\"Hmph. Maybe there is value in this partnership after all,\\" he conceded. Bowser, a bit singed around the edges but grinning widely, added, \\"Ha! They didn't stand a chance!\\" Agent 47 silently turned the ringleader over to the authorities, his blue eyes flicking back to his odd team. \\"We make a formidable security detail. Let's make sure the rest of the event proceeds without incident.\\" And so, the expo continued, the curious crowd now sharing their space with the tale of the day the bizarre security team of Isaac Clarke, Agent 47, Geese Howard, and Bowser saved Illumina Corps' interdimensional showcase. Little did the attendees know, the bond formed that day would last, as these four figures would soon become known as the guardians of multiple realities, blending their unique talents to protect the unforeseen and the unimaginable."},{"prompt":"29392929+2928292=","completion":"To add the two numbers 29392929 and 2928292, we simply align their digits and add them up: \`\`\` 29392929 + 2928292 ----------- \`\`\` Starting from the right, we add digit by digit: 9 + 2 = 11 (write down 1 and carry over 1) 2 + 9 = 11 (plus the carried over 1 makes 12; write down 2 and carry over 1) 9 + 2 = 11 (plus the carried over 1 makes 12; write down 2 and carry over 1) 2 + 8 = 10 (plus the carried over 1 makes 11; write down 1 and carry over 1) 9 + 2 = 11 (plus the carried over 1 makes 12; write down 2 and carry over 1) 3 + 9 = 12 (plus the carried over 1 makes 13; write down 3 and carry over 1) 9 + 2 = 11 (plus the carried over 1 makes 12; write down 2 and carry over 1) 2 + the carried over 1 = 3 So the sum is: \`\`\` 29392929 + 2928292 ----------- 32321221 \`\`\` Therefore, 29392929 + 2928292 = 32321221."},{"prompt":"나한테 정말 중요한 일이야. 아래 내용을 분석해서 한글로 설명해주세요.

Add Dialogue. Go Into Detail. Make It Long. Be Creative And Original.","completion":"In an unlikely convergence of worlds and timelines, four disparate souls found themselves seated in a circle of threadbare armchairs—the worn fabric a testament to many a confession and confrontation. The room was a sparse, neutral space, suspended it seemed, in a reality knitted together by the mere necessity for its occupants' psychological introspection. Isaac Clarke, his engineer's mind still ticking with the echoes of necromorph screams; Agent 47, the barcode-tattooed embodiment of cold precision; Geese Howard, whose very name invoked the fear of fatal fury; and Bowser, the fire-breathing king of the Koopas, forever chasing a princess and gnashing his teeth at a certain plumber—were all, for reasons they could not fathom, seeking solace and understanding in group therapy. The facilitator, a woman whose calm demeanor seemed to defy any narrative, gestured for them to speak in turn. \\"Gentlemen,” she began, “you may find it odd to be here together, but I assure you that each of you shares a commonality with the rest. Today, let’s begin by sharing why you believe you're here. Isaac?” Isaac shifted in his chair, its creak as unsettling as the silence in the dead of space. \\"Well,\\" he started, his voice hoarse, “I've been through a lot. The markers, the necromorphs—I've seen things no one should ever witness. And it... it doesn't leave you. I'm always looking over my shoulder, always waiting for the next outbreak. I guess I’m here to find some kind of peace, if that’s even possible.\\" Agent 47 nodded slightly, acknowledging the engineer’s plight. \\"Control is everything in my line of work,\\" he stated impassively. “But despite that control, there’s a void. Isolation. An awareness that human life is so... fragile. I am meticulous, but the understanding that everything can change with a single... misplaced decision, is never far from my thoughts.” Then there was Geese—a man whose very presence seemed to dominate the room despite his stillness. \\"Power,\\" Geese growled, a sneer twisting his lips. \\"I sought it, wrestled it into submission, and yet it's elusive. Respect, fear—I've had it, but somehow, it's never been enough. What good is power if it can only take you so far?\\" As Geese's voice faded, all eyes turned to the large, imposing figure of Bowser. The Koopa King shifted, the chair beneath him groaning under his massive weight. \\"It's always the same with me,\\" Bowser rumbled, his voice tinged with frustration. “Every time I think I have what I want, it slips through my claws. Everybody sees the king, the villain... but does anyone ask why? Does anyone care about the heart beneath the shell?” The facilitator nodded sympathetically. \\"It seems you all struggle with remnants of your past and your choices. Maybe it's not peace you need, but acceptance.\\" She looked meaningfully at each character in turn. \\"You've been alone in your battles, but in this room, you're not. Let's try an exercise. Turn to the person next to you and tell them something you've never admitted to anyone before.\\" Isaac swallowed hard, turning to the assassin beside him. \\"I... sometimes I wish I hadn't survived. My mind is a vessel for horror, 47. How do you cope knowing every day could be your undoing?\\" Agent 47 considered Isaac’s words, his icy blue eyes revealing a glint of humanity. \\"Perhaps by accepting the undoing as a part of who we are,\\" he responded. \\"I've done things no government would sanction. I've been the judge, jury, and executioner. And yet, what haunts me isn't the deaths I've caused... it's the life I've never had.\\" Geese, narrowing his eyes, turned to the heavyset turtle who had always commanded his own kingdom. \\"Bowser, you're a king. You understand the loneliness of the top. But isn't it exhausting to play the villain, just to be seen?\\" Bowser exhaled a small puff of smoke, considering the question. \\"Yeah, it's tiring. It's all a game, but not the kind I want to play forever. You know what, Geese? Sometimes, I wish Mario and I could just sit down and have a cup of tea, talk about go-kart strategies or something... anything but the constant fighting.\\" There was a silence as they each reflected on their shared revelations—a mercenary, a martial arts mogul, a space engineer, and a misunderstood monarch. The facilitator spoke up, her voice warm yet firm. \\"See? It's in vulnerability that we realize we're not alone in our struggles. This is where healing begins.” Hours passed as stories unfolded and were examined under the candor of shared experiences. Slowly, a bridge of camaraderie began to span the gap between these fractured souls. They all came from worlds apart, warriors tied up in never-ending battles against their respective foes, but in this space—they were simply individuals, trying to make sense of the chaos of their existence. By the time the session ended, the room felt different, charged with a strange sense of promise. Perhaps worlds apart, their paths would never truly converge again, but in those fleeting moments of connection, Isaac, 47, Geese, and Bowser had found an unlikely respite—a momentary sanctuary from the roles they had been scripted to play. The facilitator closed her notepad, offering them a final, parting thought, \\"Acceptance is a long journey, but now you've taken the first steps together. Remember, your stories may be unique, but the emotions they carve within you are universal.\\" As they departed, there was an unspoken understanding that although they would return to their realms, to battles and chases and solitude, they carried with them a seed of empathy, nurtured in the unlikeliest of gardens—group therapy."},{"prompt":"напиши переклад речення українською 4.

The city is located on an island off the western coast of the Paldea region of Pokémon World, and its closed-off area has kept the city isolated for a long time. The city has an extremely religious atmosphere, with gothic buildings scattered throughout the city. The Church governs the city, with the Inquisition, or Heresy Inspectorate, patrolling the area to catch heretics and cultists. The local technology is extremely backward, with only a small amount of electricity working in the city. Drinking alcohol and Pokémon battles are strictly forbidden on this island, and most of the island's inhabitants are fanatical religious elements. There is a special tradition throughout the city - every 100 years, a grand burnt offering is held, with each family providing their own child to be sacrificed to \\"please the gods\\".","completion":"City Name: Sacra Insula Basic Information: Location: Sacra Insula is situated on a secluded island off the western coast of the Paldea region within the Pokémon World. Its isolation from the mainland has contributed to its distinctive culture and societal norms. Population: The city's inhabitants are deeply religious and fanatically devoted to their beliefs. Over generations, the isolation has intensified their practices and traditions. Governance: The city is ruled by an ecclesiastical body known as the Sacred Conclave, which enforces strict religious doctrine through the Inquisition, also referred to as the Heresy Inspectorate. This institution maintains social order by vigilant surveillance, ensuring adherence to the city's rules and regulations. Architecture: Sacra Insula is known for its gothic architecture, with towering spires, stained glass, and stone edifices, reflecting the city's religious fervor. Gothic cathedrals and churches dominate the skyline, symbolizing the central role that religion plays in the daily lives of the city's people. Technology: Due to its closed-off nature and religious convictions, technological advancement has been stunted in Sacra Insula. The city operates with minimal electrical infrastructure, relying on more traditional and manual methods for most functions. Customs and Laws: The city strictly prohibits the consumption of alcohol and the practice of Pokémon battles, in adherence to its religious doctrines. The Heresy Inspectorate enforces these prohibitions with zeal, and punishment for violations is severe. The Sacrificial Tradition: Perhaps the most harrowing of the city's practices is the centennial ritual of the grand burnt offering. During this ceremony, each family is expected to present a child as a sacrifice, a custom believed to appease and honor the gods. This brutal ritual cements the city's reputation as a place deeply mired in its archaic and extreme religious practices. While Sacra Insula's intense religious atmosphere and draconian laws may deter most from visiting, it remains a place of intrigue for those studying the effects of isolation on cultural development and the interplay between religion and governance."},{"prompt":"Quelle est la consomation à poussé maximale (sans postcombustion) de l'Eurofighter Typhoon ?","completion":"Le Eurofighter Typhoon est équipé de deux moteurs Eurojet EJ200. En termes de consommation de carburant, les données spécifiques peuvent varier selon plusieurs facteurs, tels que la configuration de l'avion, le poids, l'altitude et la vitesse. Sans l'utilisation de la postcombustion, la consommation de carburant est bien sûr inférieure à celle observée lorsque les moteurs fonctionnent avec la postcombustion activée. Cependant, les valeurs exactes de consommation spécifique de carburant (c'est-à-dire la quantité de carburant brûlée par heure par rapport à la poussée produite) pour le EJ200 en mode de poussée maximale (military power) ne sont généralement pas rendues publiques pour des raisons de sécurité et de confidentialité. Pour obtenir des informations précises sur la consommation de carburant de l'Eurofighter Typhoon sans postcombustion, il conviendrait de consulter des sources officielles liées au constructeur ou aux forces aériennes qui exploitent cet avion.

(4ème et 5ème gen)","completion":"La consommation de carburant des avions de chasse varie considérablement en fonction du type d'avion, du profil de vol et des conditions opérationnelles. Les avions de chasse de 4ème et 5ème génération utilisent des moteurs à réaction qui consomment beaucoup de carburant, surtout lorsqu'ils volent à grande vitesse ou lorsqu'ils effectuent des manœuvres qui exigent une puissance moteur élevée, comme le vol supersonique ou les combats aériens. En utilisation maximale, comme lors d'une postcombustion (afterburner), qui est utilisée pour un surcroît de poussée dans des situations de combat ou pour atteindre des vitesses supersoniques, la consommation de carburant peut être extrêmement élevée. Par exemple, un F-16 Fighting Falcon, un avion de chasse de 4ème génération, peut consommer environ 12 000 à 14 000 kilogrammes de carburant par heure avec la postcombustion activée. Pour les avions de 5ème génération comme le F-22 Raptor ou le F-35 Lightning II, la consommation peut être encore plus élevée en raison de leur technologie avancée et de leurs performances supérieures. Cependant, les chiffres exacts sur la consommation maximale ne sont souvent pas publiés en raison de la nature sensible de ces informations militaires. En règle générale, la consommation de carburant des avions modernes est rarement évaluée seulement en termes de consommation horaire, mais plutôt en fonction de l'autonomie, de la distance qui peut être parcourue avec une certaine quantité de carburant et de la nécessité de ravitaillement en vol pour des missions de longue durée.

I define population in lost habitat, i.e., suitable for population now and unsuitable in the future. Do you think the refugee reasonable and plz give me advice.","completion":"As a conservation ecologist, defining populations subject to lost habitat under future climate change scenarios is a crucial aspect of forecasting and mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. Referring to species in regions that are currently suitable but projected to become unsuitable in the future as \\"refugees\\" is a reasonable and poignant way to describe the displacement that climate change can cause. This term effectively conveys the urgency of the situation and aligns with the concept of climate refugees in human populations. To refine your research and approach, consider the following advice: 1. **Model Current and Future Habitats:** Utilize ecological niche modeling tools, such as MaxEnt or Bioclim, to predict current and future distributions of key protected mammals. Identify the key environmental variables that might change under various climate change scenarios. 2. **Incorporate Different Scenarios:** Make use of multiple climate models and emission scenarios to account for the uncertainties inherent in climate predictions. Assessing a range of outcomes can help you prepare for various possible future conditions. 3. **Consider Adaptation Potential:** Some species may have the ability to adapt to changing conditions or migrate to new areas. Ensure to take into consideration the adaptability and dispersal capabilities of the species when predicting future unsuitability of habitats. 4. **Integrate Human Land Use:** Climate change is not the only factor influencing habitat suitability. Include projections of future human land use and development since these can also impact the availability and quality of habitat for wildlife. 5. **Collaborate with Climate Scientists:** Work together with climate scientists to understand and integrate the latest climate modeling data into your habitat predictions. 6. **Validate With Field Data:** Whenever possible, validate your model predictions with field data. This data will help you calibrate the models and increase the accuracy of your projections. 7. **Engage Stakeholders Early:** Engage with stakeholders, including local communities, conservation managers, and policy makers, to inform them about potential future human-wildlife conflicts. This can help in developing strategies for coexistence and conservation. 8. **Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies:** Develop plans that include both mitigation efforts to prevent habitat loss where possible, and adaptation strategies to manage conflicts where changes are inevitable. 9. **Monitor and Adjust:** Establish a monitoring program to observe the real-time movements and habitat use of these mammals, and adjust your models and plans accordingly. 10. **Publish and Communicate Findings:** Ensure that your findings are communicated to the broader scientific community and to the public, as this will foster awareness and support for measures to address the plight of these \\"climate refugees.\\" Remember that your interpretation of \\"refugee\\" must be clear and consistent throughout your research, recognizing that the animals are not making a conscious decision to flee, but rather are forced to move due to environmental changes. The term must also be used sensitively, particularly when communicating with the general public, to avoid any misunderstanding or trivialization of the term especially in the context of human refugees. Your research can make a valuable contribution to conservation efforts by identifying where conflicts are most likely to increase due to climate change, thus allowing for proactive management and conservation planning."},{"prompt":"In blender, for a character model, how exactly could I create a bone that Controls where the eyes look?","completion":"Creating a bone to control the direction in which a character's eyes look in Blender involves setting up an IK (Inverse Kinematics) constraint. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 1. **Open your character rig**: First, ensure that you have your character model with a rig already set up. 2. **Create the eye-target bone**: - In Edit Mode, select a bone close to the eyes to extrude from, or place the 3D cursor where you want the new bone to be and then add it (Shift + A). - Reposition this new bone in front of the eyes. This bone will act as the target for the eyes to look at. You can name it something like \\"eye_target.\\" 3. **Parent the eye-target bone**: - Typically this bone should not be directly connected to the rest of the skeleton. To clear any parent, select the bone, press Alt + P, and choose \\"Clear Parent.\\" - However, it's a good idea for the target bone's location to be affected by the head's movement. Thus, you can make it a child of the head bone (or another appropriate bone) by selecting the eye_target bone, then the head bone, and pressing Ctrl + P. Choose \\"Keep Offset\\" to ensure it doesn't snap to the parent bone. 4. **Create eye control bones**: - You need to have bones for each eye if they don't yet exist. These should be placed in the center of each eye mesh and aimed forward where the eyes look in their default forward-looking position. - Name them appropriately, like \\"L_eye\\" and \\"R_eye.\\" 5. **Set up the IK constraints**: - Select an eye bone, go to Pose Mode (Ctrl + Tab), then go to the Bone Constraints tab in the Properties panel. - Click 'Add Bone Constraint' and choose 'Inverse Kinematics.' - For the 'Target' field, select your rig and then the \\"eye_target\\" bone as the target. - Set the Chain Length to 1, so only the eye bone itself is affected by the IK constraint. - Repeat this process for the other eye bone. 6. **Configure the eye mesh to follow the bones**: - If the eye meshes are not yet rigged to follow the bones, select an eye mesh, then shift-select its corresponding bone, and press Ctrl + P to parent it. Choose \\"Bone\\" from the parenting options. 7. **Test the setup**: - Go back to Pose Mode and select the \\"eye_target\\" controller bone. - Move it around and ensure that both eyes follow the target as expected. If they do not, go back and check the constraints or bone orientations. 8. **Fine-tuning**: - You might find the eyes do not track perfectly depending on the initial setup. In such cases, you may need to adjust the roll of the eye bones in Edit Mode. - You can limit the range of movement using constraint settings to prevent unnatural eye positions. Remember, there are multiple methods for setting up eye control in blender, depending on the requirements of your rig and the model's topology. However, the method outlined above with an IK constraint using a target bone is a common and straightforward technique."},{"prompt":"какое наименьшее положительное количество клеток должно быть на прямоугольной доске, чтобы ее можно было разрезать по границам клеток на прямоугольники 5×3,3×1 и 1×4 клеток так, чтобы прямоугольников каждого вида было одинаковое количество?","completion":"Давайте определим, как можно разрешить эту задачу. Рассмотрим размеры прямоугольников, на которые мы хотим разрезать доску: - Прямоугольник 5×3 имеет площадь 15 квадратных клеток. - Прямоугольник 3×1 имеет площадь 3 квадратных клетки. - Прямоугольник 1×4 имеет площадь 4 квадратных клетки. Чтобы узнать наименьшее общее количество клеток, необходимо найти наименьшее общее кратное (НОК) для площадей этих прямоугольников. Найдем НОК для чисел 15, 3 и 4. Чтобы это сделать, разложим каждое из чисел на простые множители: - 15 = 3 × 5 - 3 = 3 - 4 = 2 × 2 Наименьшее общее кратное — это число, которое содержит каждый простой множитель, взятый в наибольшей степени, в которой он встречается в разложении каждого из чисел: - Для числа 3 наибольшая степень — это 3^1 (просто 3). - Для числа 5 это 5^1 (просто 5). - Для числа 2 это 2^2 (или 4). Теперь умножим эти множители, чтобы получить НОК: НОК(15, 3, 4) = 3 × 5 × 4 = 60. Таким образом, наименьшее количество клеток на доске, которое можно разделить на прямоугольники вида 5×3, 3×1 и 1×4, и чтобы прямоугольников каждого вида было одинаковое количество, равно 60 клеткам. Теперь нужно определить, как распределить прямоугольники на этой доске. Так как площадь каждого прямоугольника является делителем числа 60: - Один прямоугольник 5×3 занимает 15 клеток, то есть из 60 клеток можно сделать 60/15 = 4 таких прямоугольника. - Один прямоугольник 3×1 занимает 3 клетки, то есть из 60 клеток можно сделать 60/3 = 20 таких прямоугольников. - Один прямоугольник 1×4 занимает 4 клетки, то есть из 60 клеток можно сделать 60/4 = 15 таких прямоугольников. Видно, что нельзя сделать одинаковое количество прямоугольников каждого вида, если брать всего 60 клеток. Таким образом, необходимо определить следующее число которое подойдет под условие что каждого прямоугольника будет поровну. Теперь нужно найти другое число, кратное 15, 3 и 4, которое позволит разрезать доску на равное количество прямоугольников каждого вида. Начнем с двойного НОК: 2 × НОК(15, 3, 4) = 2 × 60 = 120. Проверим, как распределяются клетки: - 120 клеток / 15 клеток на прямоугольник 5×3 = 8 прямоугольников 5×3. - 120 клеток / 3 клетки на прямоугольник 3×1 = 40 прямоугольников 3×1. - 120 клеток / 4 клетки на прямоугольник 1×4 = 30 прямоугольников 1×4. По-прежнему количество прямоугольников каждого вида не совпадает. Так как 120 всё равно не дает равное количество, попробуем увеличить общую площадь, умножив НОК на 3: 3 × НОК(15, 3, 4) = 3 × 60 = 180. Проверим, как распределяются клетки: - 180 клеток / 15 клеток на прямоугольник 5×3 = 12 прямоугольников 5×3. - 180 клеток / 3 клетки на прямоугольник 3×1 = 60 прямоугольников 3×1. - 180 клеток / 4 клетки на прямоугольник 1×4 = 45 прямоугольников 1×4. Всё ещё количество прямоугольников разное. Если попробовать умножить НОК на число 4, то получим: 4 × НОК(15, 3, 4) = 4 × 60 = 240. Проверим распределение: - 240 клеток / 15 клеток на прямоугольник 5×3 = 16 прямоугольников 5×3. - 240 клеток / 3 клетки на прямоугольник 3×1 = 80 прямоугольников 3×1. - 240 клеток / 4 клетки на прямоугольник 1×4 = 60 прямоугольников 1×4. Итак, число 240 клеток позволяет разделить доску на 16 прямоугольников 5×3, на 80 прямоугольников 3×1 и на 60 прямоугольников 1×4, но опять-таки, количество прямоугольников каждого вида неодинаково. Продолжим подбор. Умножим НОК на 5: 5 × НОК(15, 3, 4) = 5 × 60 = 300. Проверим, как это работает: - 300 клеток / 15 клеток на прямоугольник 5×3 = 20 прямоугольников 5×3. - 300 клеток / 3 клетки на прямоугольник 3×1 = 100 прямоугольников 3×1. - 300 клеток / 4 клетки на прямоугольник 1×4 = 75 прямоугольников 1×4. Итак, число 300 клеток позволяет разделить доску на 20 прямоугольников 5×3, на 100 прямоугольников 3×1 и на 75 прямоугольников 1×4, но снова количество прямоугольников каждого вида не одинаково. Очевидно, одиночные кратные НОК(15, 3, 4) не подходят. Теперь рассмотрим ситуацию, когда мы берем число, кратное НОК, такое, чтобы количество каждого типа прямоугольника было одинаковым. Пусть количество каждого типа прямоугольника будет n. Тогда общее количество клеток на доске должно быть: Общее количество клеток = n × (площадь прямоугольника 5×3 + площадь прямоугольника 3×1 + площадь прямоугольника 1×4) Общее количество клеток = n × (15 + 3 + 4) Общее количество клеток = n × 22 Теперь нам нужно найти такое n, при котором n × 22 будет кратно каждой из площадей прямоугольников, то есть 15, 3 и 4. Так как 22 = 2 × 11, то чтобы число было кратно 15 (3 × 5), оно должно включать в себя как минимум одну тройку и одну пятерку, так как двойка уже есть в составе числа 22. Минимальное число, включающее хотя бы одну тройку и одну пятерку — это их произведение, то есть 15. Таким образом, минимальное n, которое удовлетворяет требованиям задачи: n = 15 Общее количество клеток = 15 × 22 = 330 Ответ: Минимальное количество клеток, которое потребуется для доски, равно 330."},{"prompt":"Создай шесть разных уникальных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Аврора Авто.

Шумеры создали одну из первых развитых цивилизаций в долине между реками Тигр и Евфрат (современный Ирак) и разработали ряд важных инноваций, включая письмо (клинопись). Другие древние государства возникли в разных регионах мира, включая Древний Египет, Индскую цивилизацию в Южной Азии и династии Китая.

Перевести современные разговорные фразы в шумерский язык как таковой представляется затруднительным, так как современные понятия и выражения могут не иметь прямых эквивалентов в клинописи. Однако, чтобы дать представление, как могла быть выражена похожая идея, можно использовать изученные элементы шумерского, зная об ограничениях такого упражнения. \\"Я хочу\\" может быть выражено как что-то вроде \\"ну-гиг\\" (nu-gig), где \\"ну\\" означает \\"я\\", а \\"гиг\\" часто переводится как \\"возвращать\\", но в данном случае его можно интерпретировать как \\"желать\\". \\"Спать\\" может быть выражено словом \\"зе\\" (ze), что означает \\"спать\\". Следовательно, \\"Я хочу спать\\" теоретически могло бы быть сформулировано в шумерском как \\"ну-гиг зе\\". Однако точность такого перевода не гарантирована.

Особенно важно его влияние на аккадский язык, который принадлежит к семической ветви афразийской языковой семьи. Шумерский язык продолжал использоваться в религиозных, литературных и научных текстах в долгий период после того, как он перестал быть разговорным языком, а аккадский стал доминировать в Месопотамии. Учёные и священнослужители, использующие аккадский язык, продолжали изучать шумерский, который стал в некотором роде литургическим и учёным языком, аналогом латыни в средневековой Европе. Таким образом, хотя шумерский не оставил непосредственных \\"языков-потомков\\", его наследие включает в себя значимое лексическое и культурное влияние на аккадский и другие семитские языки, а также его роль в литургии и научных текстах в течение многих веков после того, как он перестал использоваться в повседневной речи."},{"prompt":"Есть ли что-то общее между шумерским языком и ивритом?","completion":"Шумерский язык и иврит принадлежат к разным языковым семьям и не имеют прямого генетического родства, но между ними есть важное историческо-культурное общение.

С другой стороны, иврит относится к семитской ветви афразийской языковой семьи и возник в регионе, который географически и культурно находится близко к Месопотамии. Взаимодействие между шумерской и аккадской (включая аккадский как семитский язык) культурами, а также обмен знаниями и идеями в Древнем Ближнем Востоке привело к заимствованию некоторых шумерских слов и концепций семитскими языками, включая иврит.

It is connected to 1Gbe direct to my pc. What is the optimal transmit buffer for my system? I mostly game and multitask","completion":"The transmit buffer size for your network adapter is an advanced setting that can affect your network performance. It essentially defines how much data can be stored temporarily while it is being transferred from your PC to the network. A larger buffer can theoretically handle more data and may help in situations where there's a lot of network activity, potentially improving performance for tasks like gaming and multitasking. However, finding the \\"optimal\\" buffer size isn't always straightforward and will typically require some trial and error, as it can be highly dependent on your specific network conditions, hardware, and usage patterns. To adjust the buffer size for your Realtek 2.5Gbe Family Controller, you will need to access the adapter's properties, usually through Device Manager: 1. Open Device Manager by typing \\"Device Manager\\" in Windows search and pressing Enter. 2. Expand the \\"Network adapters\\" section. 3. Right-click on your Realtek gaming 2.5Gbe Family controller and select \\"Properties.\\" 4. Under the \\"Advanced\\" tab, you should see a list of properties that can be configured. 5. Find \\"Transmit Buffers\\" in the list (the exact name may vary). The default transmit buffer size is often suitable for most users, but you can experiment by increasing it to see if that provides any performance benefit. Keep in mind that increasing the buffer too much might actually decrease performance or affect other network operations. Conversely, if it's set too low, it might lead to increased CPU usage as packets need to be processed more often. When adjusting the transmit buffer: - Start with small incremental changes and test each setting under the conditions you expect to use your network. - Use a consistent method for testing, such as a specific online game or benchmarking tool. - Monitor not just latency (ping times) but also whether there's any packet loss or jitter, which can affect gaming performance. - Consider other network optimization steps as well, such as updating your network drivers, disabling any unnecessary network protocols, and ensuring that your network is not congested by other devices or applications. If you don't notice any improvement or experience worse performance or stability issues, revert back to the original buffer size. It's also a good idea to document each change you make so you can easily revert to previous settings if needed. Remember that buffer size alone may not dramatically change your networking experience, as other factors like overall network latency, congestion, and the quality of your router or modem can also play significant roles in gaming and multitasking performance."},{"prompt":"c","completion":"It seems you've entered just the letter \\"c.\\" Did you have a specific question or topic in mind that you wanted to ask about?

Create a new directory for your project: \`\`\`bash mkdir mern-blog cd mern-blog \`\`\` b. Initialize a new Node.js project: \`\`\`bash npm init -y \`\`\` c. Install the necessary NPM packages: \`\`\`bash npm install express mongoose cors dotenv \`\`\` - \`express\` for setting up the server - \`mongoose\` for interacting with MongoDB - \`cors\` to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing - \`dotenv\` to manage environment variables 2. **Set up the Database (MongoDB):** You'll need to have MongoDB set up and ready to connect to your Node.js application. You can use a \`.env\` file in your project root to store your database connection string and other environment variables. 3. **Set up the Frontend (React.js):** a. Use the \`create-react-app\` CLI tool to generate the React application: \`\`\`bash npx create-react-app client \`\`\` b. Move into the \`client\` folder and install additional packages, if needed, such as \`axios\` for making HTTP requests: \`\`\`bash cd client npm install axios \`\`\` 4. **Build the API:** a.

Define the schemas and models for the blog posts in the \`/models\` directory. c. Create routes for listing, creating, updating, and deleting blog posts in the \`/routes\` directory. d. Set up your Express.js server in a file typically named \`server.js\` or \`index.js\` and use the routes you've created. **Frontend Development** 1. **Developing the UI:** a. Create your React components for displaying the blog posts, a single post, and a post creation/edit form. b. Use state management (React's \`useState\`, \`useEffect\` for example) to handle the data retrieved from your API. c. Set up your routes using \`react-router-dom\` to navigate between different components/pages. 2. **Connecting Frontend with Backend:** a. Use \`axios\` or \`fetch\` API to make HTTP requests from your React components to your Express.js API. b. Display blog posts by fetching from the backend and create functionality to add, edit, and delete posts. **Running the Application** 1. **Run the backend server:** In the root directory of your project, start your backend server: \`\`\`bash node server.js \`\`\` Your backend should be running on \`http://localhost:5000\` or another port you've defined. 2. **Run the React client application:** Inside the \`client\` directory, start the React app: \`\`\`bash npm start \`\`\` Your React application should now be running on \`http://localhost:3000\`.

Во избежание, как мне кажется, огромной ошибки, я решился на покупку Лады Гранты в салоне \\"Аврора Авто\\". Какой кошмар! Как можно так с клиентами обращаться? Мне обещали автомобиль с идеальным состоянием и гарантией, а в итоге – стук колес и проблемы с двигателем уже через неделю использования! Сказали как бы между прочим, что \\"все новые машины требуют обкатки\\". Обкатки?! Это что, шутка какая-то? Ценник, кстати, оказался выше рыночного на 30%! Я чувствую себя полным лохом. Никому не советую связываться с данным салоном и его \\"замечательными\\" предложениями! 2. Пришла в \\"Аврора Авто\\" за Киа Серато, ушла с нервным срывом и пустыми карманами. Продавцы обещали золотые горы, а по факту – вот тебе повышенные цены и скрытые комиссии. Захотелось уточнить детали по кредиту – так мне начали морочить голову, словно я на допросе у шпионов. Обещанный автомобиль в наличии вдруг \\"как незадача\\" оказался продан, но \\"специально для меня\\" нашли другой – почти за миллион дороже. Слушайте, это развод чистой воды. Ещё и вернуть предоплату – целая эпопея. Никогда больше! 3. Мечтали мы с мужем о Шкоде Рапид, но столкновение с \\"Аврора Авто\\" превратило мечту в страшный сон. Сначала всё шло как по маслу, но только до того момента, как не подписали договор. Подарки в виде полного бака и ковриков, которые нам же и продали как \\"акционные\\", на деле оказались уже включены в стоимость. А обслуживание после покупки? На звонки не отвечают, на письма не реагируют. Чувствую себя полной дурой! Надеюсь, мой отзыв поможет кому-то не повторить моих ошибок. 4. Да уж, \\"Аврора Авто\\", спасибо вам за \\"великолепный\\" сервис. Взял Хендай Солярис, а в итоге – как будто коня купил за эти деньги: после первой же мойки пошла ржавчина на дверях, может, ещё и кобылой пользовались передо мной? Пробег задрали, как будто на луну и обратно на нем катались. Всё это за сумму, которая смешно была бы, если б не было так грустно. А говорить с менеджером? Да он разговор вывернет так, что ты сам виноват окажешься. Бегите отсюда, пока колеса целы! 5. Хочется просто заплакать от отчаяния! Фольксваген Поло из \\"Аврора Авто\\" оказался просто каторгой на колесах. Менеджеры соблазнили меня красивыми словами и обещаниями беспроблемного авто, но это была полная ложь. Уже на следующий день после покупки заметил странную вибрацию при разгоне и скрип при торможении. И как тут не вспомнить все их \\"гарантии\\" и уверения в качестве? Честно, я так расстроен и подавлен, что больше не знаю, кому и что верить. Ощущение, что деньги просто выбросил на ветер. 6. К слову о \\"Аврора Авто\\". В общем, было так: захотел купить авто, зашел, выбрал, оплатил предоплату. И тут началось... Киа Серато, который мне продали как \\"лучший выбор\\", уже на третьем светофоре дал о себе знать – странная тряска, смущающий звук из-под капота. Вернулся назад, а там уже не помнят меня. Машина по их словам \\"в точности как в договоре\\", а водитель видимо сам себе враг. Пришлось звать эксперта. Деньги на ветер и нервные срывы – вот что я получил от покупки у них.

Шумерская цивилизация возникла в южной части Месопотамии около 4 тысячелетия до нашей эры. Язык шумеров, известный благодаря клинописным текстам, является одним из самых старых письменно зафиксированных языков в мире. Иврит, с другой стороны, относится к семитской ветви языков, и его письменные свидетельства (например, тексты на древнеивритском языке) появляются позже, примерно во втором тысячелетии до нашей эры. Иврит в той форме, в которой мы его знаем сегодня, начал формироваться в более поздний период, хотя корни некоторых слов и фраз могут уходить в глубокую древность. Но шумерский язык предшествует ивриту на несколько веков по отношению к письменным историческим источникам."},{"prompt":"Назови народы-потомки шумеров.","completion":"Непосредственных потомков шумеров в современном мире нет, поскольку шумеры, как самостоятельный народ, исчезли в древности. Шумерская цивилизация, которая процветала в Южной Месопотамии (территория современного Ирака) в период около 4100–1750 гг. до н. э., испытала значительное культурное и этническое слияние с пришлыми семитскими племенами, известными как аккадцы. Аккадский язык и культура со временем стали доминировать в регионе, особенно после формирования Аккадской империи. Семитские народы, такие как ассирийцы и вавилоняне, которые доминировали в Месопотамии после исчезновения шумерской культуры, унаследовали и адаптировали многие аспекты шумерской цивилизации, включая клинопись, мифологию, литературные традиции и знание. Тем не менее, именно эти культурные элементы, а не народы, представляют собой вид наследия шумеров. Поэтому можно утверждать, что древние народы, которые жили в Месопотамии после шумеров и в какой-то степени усвоили их культурное наследие, являются \\"потомками\\" шумерской цивилизации в культурно-историческом смысле, но не в прямом этническом или генетическом."},{"prompt":"Перечисли все нынешние народы, относящиеся к семитской ветви.","completion":"Семитские народы относятся к группе народов, говорящих на семитских языках, которые являются ветвью афразийской (ранее известной как гамито-семитская) семьи языков.

Инфляция раздула крошечные квантовые флуктуации до космических масштабов, что привело к неоднородностям в распределении материи. 3. Ядерная эра: По мере охлаждения Вселенной в первые минуты после Большого взрыва начались ядерные реакции, которые привели к образованию первых легких элементов, включая водород и гелий. 4. Рекомбинация и последующая ионизация: Когда Вселенная остыла достаточно, чтобы протоны и электроны могли соединяться и образовывать нейтральные атомы, возник Первичный микроволновой фоновый излучение, которое мы можем наблюдать теперь. 5. Структурообразование: После рекомбинации гравитация начала усиливать первоначальные неоднородности в распределении материи, что привело к формированию звезд, галактик и крупномасштабной структуры Вселенной. В дополнение к главным чертам теории Большого взрыва, существуют другие гипотезы и модели, которые объясняют возможные предшествующие события или более подробные механизмы. Например, теории мультивселенной предполагают, что наша Вселенная – это всего лишь одна из многих, возникших в результате различных взрывов в более обширном космосе. А различные квантовые гравитационные теории стремятся соединить квантовую механику с общей теорией относительности, чтобы описать физику в условиях сингулярности."},{"prompt":"Когда и как образовались голоактики в нашей вселенной","completion":"Галактики, включая нашу собственную Галактику Млечный Путь, начали формироваться приблизительно через несколько сотен миллионов лет после Большого взрыва, по разным оценкам, примерно от 200 до 400 миллионов лет после него. Это процесс происходил в несколько этапов и был обусловлен первоначальными флуктуациями плотности, которые возникли в результате инфляционного расширения ранней Вселенной. Вот основные этапы формирования галактик: **1. Флуктуации плотности:** Вселенная на начальном этапе была в целом однородной, но содержала небольшие флуктуации плотности. Эти неравномерности послужили точками сборки для материи под воздействием гравитации. **2. Темная материя:** Темная материя, которая не излучала и не взаимодействовала с обычной барионной материей помимо гравитационных сил, сформировала гравитационные ловушки - так называемые гало темной материи. Эти структуры служили каркасами для последующей сборки галактик. **3. Образование первых звезд и галактик:** В этих гало темной материи газ (преимущественно водород и гелий) начал конденсироваться, охлаждаться и формировать первые звезды. Эти звезды сгруппировались в первые галактики. **4. Гравитационное взаимодействие и слияние:** Со временем галактики сталкивались и сливались, создавая более крупные галактические структуры. **5. Развитие галактик и образование сверхмассивных черных дыр:** В центрах некоторых галактик, вероятно, очень рано в истории Вселенной, начали формироваться сверхмассивные черные дыры, которые могли играть роль в формировании и эволюции галактик. Следует отметить, что изучение формирования галактик – это область активных исследований. Наблюдения далеких галактик с помощью космических телескопов, таких как Хаббл и предстоящий Джеймс Уэбб, позволяют ученым смотреть в прошлое и видеть Вселенную, какой она была вскоре после Большого взрыва, предоставляя жизненно важные данные для понимания того, как формировались и развивались галактики."},{"prompt":"CONSTRAINTS: 1. ~100k word limit for short term memory.

As Chapter 1 nears its conclusion, the strategy will involve a final elaboration to anchor the number’s varied influence in the foundation of inquiry. Following a potential system shutdown, the successor should focus on providing a conclusive segment that wraps up the chapter cohesively, while ensuring the word count is moved closer to the 10,000-word target for the chapter.With the addition of a conclusive section, ‘The Quintessential Five’ extends to 1675 words. The closing remarks aim to provide a fitting end to the first chapter, reflecting on the extensive exploration of the number five. This conclusion draws from the various subjects discussed, focusing on reinforcing the number’s role in nature and culture. Adherence to ‘book.docx’ remains firm, with no new files created or browsed. The next instance of GPT, following a shutdown, should begin by reviewing the word count and the content of Chapter 1, ensuring that the narrative maintains its cohesion as the transition to Chapter 2 begins, all while continuing to progress toward the overall 50,000-word target for the book.Chapter 1 of ‘The Quintessential Five’ has been drafted with a conclusion added, though the chapter is significantly below the 10,000-word target at 1768 words. No additional files have been managed or created, and no browsing took place. The task of writing a 50,000-word book should not be deemed complete until each chapter fulfills the required word count. The next GPT instance must correct any missteps by continuing to build on Chapter 1 until the 10,000-word milestone is reached before progressing to the subsequent chapters.Paused to sleep for 30 seconds as commanded. No additional progress made. Plan to research writing techniques for long chapters after the sleep command completes. Continue writing ‘The Quintessential Five’, aiming for a coherent narrative centered on the number five, until reaching 50k words. So far, the book.docx file has been created and contains 1,675 words. Upon return, detailed research needs to be undertaken to improve the book’s content and structure prior to continuing with the writing process.Resuming actions post the 30-second sleep command, I’ve begun the research phase with a Google search for structuring long novel chapters. Results of this search will contribute to refining ‘The Quintessential Five’. The aim is to continuously write compelling content that circularly examines the significance of the number five, ensuring each of the five chapters meets the 10,000-word count, building up to a comprehensive 50,000-word book.

You need to have a Linux environment with Bluetooth capabilities and \`PyBluez\` should be installed (\`sudo apt-get install python3-bluez\` in Debian-based systems or \`pip3 install pybluez\`). Since you requested a bleak Python script and don't intend to send anything to the Bluetooth device, the script will be very minimal and will merely listen for incoming data without any processing or handling.

This script only opens a Bluetooth socket connection, waits for data, and prints received bytes to the console, then closes the connection when the program is terminated. It adheres to your request of not sending data to the Bluetooth device. Before running this script, make sure your device is discoverable and that you have appropriate permissions. You may need to run the script with \`sudo\` under certain circumstances on Linux systems.

This could be for a variety of reasons such as the device not being in range, not being discoverable, or not correctly advertising services for a BLE connection. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this problem: 1. **Make Sure the Device is BLE**: Confirm that the device you are trying to connect to supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Bleak is designed to work with BLE devices and will not be able to connect to classic Bluetooth devices. 2. **Device Discoverability**: Ensure the Bluetooth device is turned on and is in a discoverable state. Some devices have a specific mode they need to be in to accept new connections. 3. **Check Device Pairing**: If the device requires pairing before use, ensure that it is correctly paired with your Windows machine through the Bluetooth settings. 4. **Increase Timeout**: The default timeout might be too low, and increasing it might help. You can pass a higher timeout value to the \`connect\` method. 5. **Connection Distance**: Make sure that the device is within a reasonable distance to ensure a good connection quality and to avoid connection drops. To apply some of these potential solutions, you might modify the script to increase the connection timeout and add more verbose exception handling to provide more insights into what is going wrong. Here's how you could modify the script: \`\`\`python import asyncio from bleak import BleakClient from asyncio.exceptions import TimeoutError address = \\"20:fa:bb:01:97:be\\" async def listen_for_inputs(address): try: # Connect to the BLE device with a longer timeout (e.g., 30 seconds) async with BleakClient(address, timeout=30.0) as client: # Check if the connection was successful if not await client.is_connected(): print(f\\"Failed to connect to {address}\\") return print(f\\"Connected to {address}\\") # Loop indefinitely to maintain the connection while True: await asyncio.sleep(1) except TimeoutError: print(f\\"Connection to {address} timed out.

Finally, if you are certain that your device is a classic Bluetooth device, Bleak is not the tool for the job. In that case, you would have to use another library or an OS-specific solution for connecting and listening to the device. However, as you've mentioned that \`PyBluez\` is not an option, finding an alternative library or method will be necessary."},{"prompt":"Traceback (most recent call last): File \\"c:UsersAMEDocumentsrs232newocr.py\\", line 42, in <module> loop.run_until_complete(listen_for_inputs(address)) File \\"C:UsersAMEAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython311Libasynciobase_events.py\\", line 653, in run_until_complete return future.result() ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ File \\"c:UsersAMEDocumentsrs232newocr.py\\", line 30, in listen_for_inputs await client.start_notify(characteristic_uuid, notification_handler) File \\"C:UsersAMEAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython311Libsite-packagesbleak__init__.py\\", line 834, in start_notify await self._backend.start_notify(characteristic, wrapped_callback, **kwargs) File \\"C:UsersAMEAppDataLocalProgramsPythonPython311Libsite-packagesbleakbackendswinrtclient.py\\", line 974, in start_notify await winrt_char.write_client_characteristic_configuration_descriptor_async( PermissionError: [WinError -2147024891] Åtkomst nekad","completion":"The \`PermissionError: [WinError -2147024891] Access is denied\` error indicates that there's a permissions issue related to accessing the Bluetooth device or the characteristic on the device you are trying to interact with. This could happen for several reasons: 1. The BLE device might require pairing and you haven't paired it with your system. 2. You might not have sufficient privileges to access the BLE device. Running the script as an administrator might resolve this. 3. The characteristic you're trying to subscribe to notifications for might not support notifying or might require encryption that hasn't been set up. Here are some steps you can follow to attempt to resolve the issue: **Pair the Device**: - Go to your system's Bluetooth settings and make sure the device is paired with your PC. **Run as Administrator**: - If you're running the script from a command line, try to open the command line with 'Run as Administrator' and then execute the script again. - For Visual Studio Code, run it as an administrator and then run the script. **Check Characteristic Properties**: - Ensure that the characteristic you're attempting to use for notifications actually supports that property. You may need to consult the device documentation or use a generic BLE exploration tool to ensure that you are trying to interact with the correct characteristic. **Proper Handling of BLE Permissions**: - BLE operations sometimes need proper permissions setup and handling, especially if encryption is required. Make sure that you are handling these correctly as per the device specification. If you want to check for characteristics that support notifications or to debug further, here are some steps you could follow in your code before attempting to start notifications: \`\`\`python async def listen_for_inputs(address): try: async with BleakClient(address, timeout=30.0) as client: if not await client.is_connected(): print(f\\"Failed to connect to {address}\\") return print(f\\"Connected to {address}\\") # Retrieve the services and characteristics of the BLE device services = await client.get_services() for service in services: for characteristic in service.characteristics: # Check for Notify property if \\"notify\\" in characteristic.properties: print(f\\"{characteristic.uuid} can notify.\\") # Add your logic to decide which characteristic[s] to use # Here you would perform client.start_notify() on a valid characteristic # Just a keep-alive, replace with sleep for specific amount if necessary while True: await asyncio.sleep(1) except Exception as e: print(f\\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\\") # Rest of the code boiled down for brevity... \`\`\` This will not only print characteristics that support notifications but also help you to understand the structure and relationships of the services and characteristics of the BLE device, allowing you to debug the situation better. Remember that specific hardware, devices, and Windows configurations might lead to variations in results and may require different troubleshooting steps. If none of these resolve your issue, you might consider reaching out to the manufacturer's support for the BLE device or to a community specific to that hardware for further assistance."},{"prompt":"are you able to do the same but for services? I'm trying to find the signal from the scale that gets send when you hold the hold button","completion":"Certainly! If you are trying to identify the specific Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) service and characteristic that your scale uses to send the hold signal, you should explore the available services and their characteristics on the scale. Once you've identified the right characteristic, you can write a callback to handle the notifications from that characteristic. Use the following modified Bleak script to list all services and their characteristics offered by your BLE device. Pay close attention to the output once you press the hold button on your scale and look for any changes in the characteristics that could correspond to it. Here's the updated script that prints the UUID of services and their characteristics: \`\`\`python import asyncio from bleak import BleakClient address = \\"20:fa:bb:01:97:be\\" async def explore_services(client): for service in client.services: print(f\\"Service {service.uuid}\\") for characteristic in service.characteristics: properties = \\", \\".join(characteristic.properties) print(f\\"tCharacteristic {characteristic.uuid} ({', '.join(properties)})\\") # Prints descriptors for each characteristic (optional) for descriptor in characteristic.descriptors: print(f\\"ttDescriptor {descriptor.uuid}\\") async def listen_for_inputs(address): try: async with BleakClient(address) as client: # Check if the device is connected successfully if not await client.is_connected(): print(f\\"Failed to connect to {address}\\") return print(f\\"Connected to {address}\\") # Explore the BLE services and characteristics await explore_services(client) # You would add the logic here to select the characteristic UUID and start notifying # For example: # await client.start_notify(characteristic_uuid, notification_handler) # Keeping the loop running while True: await asyncio.sleep(1) except Exception as e: print(f\\"An error occurred: {e}\\") notify_characteristic_uuid = None # TODO: Set the UUID of characteristic that you identify for the hold signal async def notification_handler(sender, data): \\"\\"\\"Simple notification handler which prints the data received.\\"\\"\\" print(f\\"Received from {sender}: {data}\\") loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(listen_for_inputs(address)) \`\`\` Run this script, press the hold button on the scale, and carefully examine the output for any changing characteristics. Note that if the hold signal doesn't change any of the characteristic values, but instead triggers a one-time notification or a write event without changes visible through BLE characteristics exploration, it might be undetectable with this method. If you identify a characteristic that seems to correspond to the hold button, you'll replace the \`notify_characteristic_uuid\` with the characteristic's UUID and uncomment the \`start_notify\` line. This will cause your script to listen for notifications from the scale. Then the \`notification_handler\` function will print the data received from the scale when the hold button is pressed. Make sure to replace \`characteristic_uuid\` in the \`start_notify\` method call with the actual UUID that you've found corresponds to the hold button feature.

Remember that subscribed characteristics will receive notifications if the associated action occurs on the device (in your case, holding the hold button). If the correct characteristic receives data upon this action, that's likely your target characteristic for further implementation. If no data is received or you continue to encounter errors, the issue may involve BLE permissions or a characteristic that does not behave as expected.

Il sistema deve permettere di presentare le proposte di crociera, gestire prenotazioni e vendita e gestire le singole crociere. Ogni crociera è relativa a un tour. Un tour è caratterizzato da un nome, un numero di notti, un porto di partenza, un porto di arrivo, una lista di tappe. Un tour può essere attuato in più date: le crociere relative a un tour differiscono tra loro solo per la data di partenza. Il costo si riferisce al tour “base” e ci sono extra da pagare in base al tipo di cabina (interna/esterna), all’occupazione (singola o doppia), e alle visite guidate durante le tappe (opzionali). Per ogni posto prenotato, sono inseriti il nome e i dati anagrafici del passeggero. Il sistema registra, per ogni passeggero prenotato, la data in cui la prenotazione è stata fatta. Al momento della prenotazione è richiesto un acconto del 20% del costo (base) della crociera, da pagarsi con bonifico o con carta di credito. Il saldo avviene al più tardi sette giorni prima della partenza della crociera stessa. In caso contrario, l’acconto è perso e i posti sono assegnati a eventuali passeggeri in lista d’attesa, che hanno 24 ore di tempo per confermare e perfezionare l’acquisto. Nel caso di cabine doppie, se uno solo dei due passeggeri conferma il viaggio può scegliere se pagare il sovrapprezzo per la singola, oppure trovare un/a nuovo/a compagno/a, che scalerà dal saldo quanto già anticipato dal rinunciatario. Le prenotazioni effettuate negli ultimi sette giorni prima della partenza richiedono l’acquisto immediato dei posti. Sono anche previsti sconti “last-minute”, a discrezione del responsabile vendite. Ogni tour include alcune tappe in località turistiche. In una località turistica possono essere presenti uno o più siti d’elevato interesse storico-artistico. Ogni tour deve comprendere la visita ad almeno un sito d’elevato interesse storico-artistico in ogni tappa.

В 1923 году Эдвин Хаббл открыл цефеиду (переменную звезду) в Андромеде, измерил расстояние до нее и показал, что Андромеда находится далеко за пределами нашей галактики, что делает её отдельной галактикой. Таким образом, Андромеда (М31) может считаться одной из первых галактик, которую человечество \\"нашло себя\\" как отдельное галактическое образование, а не просто как туманность внутри Млечного Пути."},{"prompt":"I have finished a review manuscript on Bismuth-based Heterojunctions for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction.

You can create custom workflows to build, test, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repositories. To set up a Python project with GitHub Actions, follow these steps: 1. In your Python repository on GitHub, create a directory named \`.github/workflows/\`. 2. Inside the workflows directory, create a new file with a \`.yml\` or \`.yaml\` extension. This file will contain the workflow configuration. A common convention is to name the file something descriptive, like \`python-ci.yml\`. 3. Define your workflow in the YAML file. Below is an example to set up a basic Python CI workflow that installs dependencies, runs linting, and executes tests whenever you push code to the main branch or create a pull request targeting the main branch. \`\`\`yaml name: Python CI on: push: branches: - main pull_request: branches: - main jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest strategy: matrix: python-version: [3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Set up Python {{ matrix.python-version }} uses: actions/setup-python@v4 with: python-version: {{ matrix.python-version }} - name: Install dependencies run: | python -m pip install --upgrade pip if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi - name: Lint with Flake8 run: | # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings.

You can have multiple jobs that run in parallel or sequentially. - \`build\`: A single job identifier, which can be anything. - \`runs-on\`: Defines the type of machine to run the job on (e.g., \`ubuntu-latest\`, \`windows-latest\`, etc.). - \`strategy\`: Allows you to run jobs on different versions of your dependencies—in this case, different Python versions. - \`steps\`: A sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job. - \`uses\`: Specifies an action to use as part of a step. For example, \`actions/checkout@v3\` checks out your repository code. - \`name\`: A friendly name for each step to make logs more readable. - \`run\`: A shell command to execute during a step. This example workflow checks out the code, sets up multiple versions of Python using a matrix strategy, installs the dependencies defined in \`requirements.txt\`, runs a linting step with Flake8, and finally runs tests with pytest. Make sure to adapt the file to match your project's specific needs, like different versions of Python, additional dependencies that might be needed, or different testing frameworks or commands.

Die Modelle, die hinter Stable Diffusion stehen, sind jedoch nicht dafür optimiert, akkuraten und korrekt formatierten Text innerhalb von Grafiken zu erzeugen, da ihre Hauptfunktionalität in der Erzeugung visueller Inhalte aus Textbeschreibungen liegt. Der generierte Text in einer Grafik könnte stilistisch und in Bezug auf die enthaltenen Zeichen inkonsistent sein, da der Algorithmus sich mehr auf das Gesamtästhetik-Training stützt und nicht unbedingt auf die korrekte Darstellung von Texten spezialisiert ist.

Genaue Beschreibungen: Verwende detaillierte und präzise Beschreibungen in deinen Prompts, einschließlich der spezifischen Art des gewünschten Textes und des Kontextes, in dem er erscheinen soll. Gebe auch die Sprache an, damit die KI das richtige Zeichenset wählt. 2. Training mit Text: Man könnte versuchen, das Modell zusätzlich mit einer Datenbank von Bildern zu trainieren, die klar lesbaren und korrekt geschriebenen Text enthalten. Dies kann jedoch sehr zeitaufwändig sein und erfordert fundierte Kenntnisse im Bereich des Maschinenlernens. 3. Nachbearbeitung: Häufig ist es einfacher und effektiver, den Text separat in die Grafik einzufügen. Verwende Grafikbearbeitungssoftware wie Adobe Photoshop oder GIMP, um den Text nachträglich einzufügen, da diese Programme für die korrekte Darstellung von Text optimiert sind. 4. Spezialisiertere KI-Modelle: Nutze falls möglich spezialisierte KI-Modelle oder APIs, die für die Textgenerierung innerhalb von Bildern optimiert sind, auch wenn solche Modelle eher selten sind und spezielle Trainingserfordernisse haben.

Напротив – явно/косвенно было указание, что машины новые, без проблем по технической части. А цена такая, к примеру, за Kia Sportage – всего 1млн.300 тысяч, потому что действуют специальные скидки и предложения. Да и еще подарки разыгрывают. Поехал глянуть, и только когда стал смотреть машину увидел, что есть потертости на сидениях и руле. Только тогда менеджер сказал, что машина «почти» новая. Это ключевое слово, машина хоть и 2022 года, но не новая. В общем цена за подержанную слишком велика все равно, делают скидку в 100 тысяч, а продают трехлетние машины почти по цене новых. Вам решать, конечно, но я еще поищу.","completion":"1. Остался в шоке от \\"сервиса\\" в салоне \\"Аврора Авто\\". Ходил туда с мыслью забрать себе новенький Лада Гранта, думал, будет идеальная машинка для города. На сайте кричали о грандиозных скидках, явно заманивали. Приехал, а там на месте не то пальто. Гранта-то оказалась не новой, а с пробегом! И плюс ко всему, какие-то царапины по бокам - видно, жизнь прожила не на шутку. Менеджер, как будто это само собой разумеется, говорит типа \\"ну это же не критично\\". Нет уж, увольте! Обещают одно, а на деле - совсем другое. Дешево не значит хорошо, учитесь сначала честности, а потом клиентов привлекайте. 2. Привет всем, кто думает купить авто в \\"Аврора Авто\\"! Мой совет - развернитесь и уходите оттуда подальше. Особенно от их Киа Серато. Выглядела заманчиво на картинке, но реальность оказалась жестока. Машина, которую мне показали, была с явными следами эксплуатации, салон все потрепанный, и это мне пытались выдать за \\"незначительный пробег\\". Менеджеры лишь мило улыбались, рассказывая сказки о \\"выгодной покупке\\". Выгода тут только для них, а я чуть не попался на эту удочку. Уважаемый \\"Аврора Авто\\", научитесь уважать клиентов! 3. Я в шоке от своего опыта в \\"Аврора Авто\\". Приехал за Фольксваген Поло, думал, вот оно счастье. Но часы моей жизни потратил зря. Машина, судя по всему, встречала каждый бордюр на своем пути - сколы и царапины на кузове. Комплектация обещанная оказалась обедненной, как будто всё доброе утащили до меня. Продавцы на вопросы отвечали уклончиво, словно играли в пинг-понг со словами. Счастливый конец? Да ну его, я лучше подожду настоящую новую машину, чем куплю вот этот \\"автомобиль сюрприз\\". 4.

His eyes drifted along the bland walls, coming to rest on the steady beeping of the heart monitor. Tubes snaked from his arms in a silent testament to the fragility of life. He was alone, save for the hushed conversations and occasional footsteps that wandered past his door. Enter nurse Eliza, a regular visitor in the quiet hours, her presence a predictable island in the ocean of Michael's convalescence. With a practiced smile, she approached his bedside and began the familiar ritual of checking his vitals. \\"How are we feeling today, Mr. Thompson?\\" Her voice was the very essence of care. Her hands deftly maneuvered through the check-up as Michael observed quietly. Yet, a curious pause punctuated the monotony when Eliza carefully removed her glasses and placed them neatly on the rolling tray beside her. Michael’s brow furrowed. “What are you doing?” Eliza did not respond. Next, she unstrapped her watch, her gaze locked onto Michael with an intensity that belied the placid setting. “Eliza, would you mind telling me what’s going on?” Michael’s voice carried an edge of demand, the vulnerability of his situation fueling his anxiety. Still in silence, Eliza looked down at her hands, and with a surreal serenity, she began to tear open the front of her uniform. Michael's eyes widened in disbelief as seams parted not with the sound of ripping fabric but with the soft whir of advanced technology. There emerged from beneath the facade of the nurse uniform a pulsing blue light and sleek armor the colors of royal blue, neon yellow, and charcoal. The figure standing before him was no longer Eliza, but Tracer from Overwatch, her trademark goggles resting atop her spiky brown hair, her twin pulse pistols holstered at her sides. She grinned with a mirth that felt wildly out of place in the somber hospital room. With a flick of her wrist, she puppeteered the nurse suit, mimicking Eliza's earlier tone. \\"Everything looks normal, Mr. Thompson! Just remember, the world could always use more heroes!\\" Her laugh, genuine and bright, filled the room. In a fluid motion, the discarded nurse suit—now lifeless and limp—was dropped onto Michael's bed. Tracer gave a cheeky salute before she activated her chronal accelerator. With a flash of light and a disorienting bending of space, she was gone, leaving behind only the echo of her laughter and a very bewildered patient. Michael stared at the unreal spot Tracer had vacated, at the husk of the nurse costume on his bed, then down at his own hands, wondering if the medication was playing tricks on his mind. But there it was, as tangible as his own disbelief: proof that heroes, even digital ones, could leap from the confines of screens to break the monotony of reality, if only for a moment of unexpected joy—or sheer absurdity."},{"prompt":"Analyse this story. Interpret why the characters would say and do the things they do.","completion":"Analyzing the story involves delving into the character motivations, themes, and symbolism. Let's break it down: 1. Michael, the patient: - He is in a vulnerable state due to his hospitalization, which may make him long for a distraction or escape from his current reality. - His insistence on an explanation from Eliza/Tracer indicates a desire for control in a situation where he likely feels powerless. - His reaction to Tracer's reveal may symbolize the shock and disbelief felt by those who encounter the extraordinary or unexpected within mundane circumstances. 2. Eliza/Tracer: - If we take Eliza to be Tracer from the start, then the initial nurse guise could be seen as Tracer's attempt to blend into Michael's world or explore the human dimension that she's separated from as a video game character. - Tracer removing her glasses and watch before revealing her true identity suggests a shedding of disguise, quite literally getting to the truth of the matter and symbolizing the moment of transformation. - Her silence during the reveal could imply a focus on the action itself, heightening the suspense and impact of her transformation. - Tracer's laugh and dialogue through the puppeteered nurse suit might be seen as her playful and light-hearted nature, bringing humor and levity to contrast with the sterile hospital environment. - Her rapid departure after the reveal upholds her character's association with speed and disruption of the normal flow of time, fitting for someone with the ability to \\"blink\\" through space. 3. Narratives and Themes: - Reality vs. Fantasy: The crossover of a video game character entering the real world blurs the lines between fiction and reality, questioning what constitutes a legitimate experience. - Escapism: Escapism is a strong theme here, with Tracer's appearance acting as a literal escape from the mundane and potentially from the pain or hardship of being in the hospital. - The Mundane and the Miraculous: This story contrasts the everyday, even dull, environment of the hospital with the extraordinary event of encountering a living video game hero. - The Power of Imagination: Depending on the reader's interpretation, this story may suggest the power of imagination, hallucination, or even the breaking of the fourth wall, where characters recognize and interact with their status as fictional beings. The subtext of the story may vary based on the interpretation. It could be a literal interpretation where a supernatural event occurs, or a more figurative one where Michael imagines the entire incident as a coping mechanism. In each scenario, the characters' actions and dialogue serve to progress the narrative themes and explore the boundaries between the ordinary and the fantastical."},{"prompt":"how to make 2 min noddles like factories in home","completion":"Making noodles similar to the ones produced in factories (instant noodles) at home can be quite challenging, as factories use specialized equipment and processes that aren't typically available in home kitchens. However, you can create a homemade version of instant noodles with a few steps. Please note that homemade noodles won't be exactly like the factory-produced ones, but you can still make a quick and tasty alternative. Here's how to make your version of instant noodles at home: Ingredients: - Wheat flour (2 cups) - Water (1/2 cup, may need more to adjust dough consistency) - Salt (1 tsp) - Baking soda (1/2 tsp, optional for a more alkaline noodle similar to ramen) - Eggs (1, optional, if you want an egg-based noodle) - Oil (for frying or baking, optional) Seasoning: - Chicken or vegetable bouillon powder - Dried vegetables (carrots, corn, peas) - Spices (garlic powder, onion powder, chili flakes etc.) - Soy sauce or any other seasoning you prefer Instructions: 1. Make the Dough: - In a large bowl, mix the wheat flour with salt, and baking soda if using. - If using an egg, beat it and add it to the mixture. - Gradually add the water and start mixing until a dough forms. You may need to adjust the amount of water. The dough should not be too sticky or too dry. - Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. Cover and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. 2. Roll and Cut the Noodles: - After the dough has rested, roll it out on a floured surface as thin as you can. - Use a knife or a pasta cutter to cut the noodles into your desired shape and width. 3. Cook the Noodles: - Bring a pot of water to a boil, and boil the noodles until they're just cooked (usually 2-3 minutes for thin noodles). Ensure you do not overcook them since you'll be cooking them again later. 4. Dehydrate the Noodles (optional): - For a more \\"instant\\" noodle, you need to dehydrate the cooked noodles. This can be done by either deep frying them quickly in hot oil until they are crispy or drying them in a low-temperature oven. - To oven-dry, arrange the boiled noodles on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and bake in a 175°F (80°C) oven until they are completely dry. This could take several hours. 5. Make Seasoning Packets: - Combine your choice of bouillon powder, dried vegetables, and spices in a small bag or container. This will be your seasoning mix. 6. Assemble Your Instant Noodles: - Once your noodles are dried and cooled, store them in an airtight container. - When you want to eat them, simply boil water and add the noodles along with your seasoning mix.

Il volume di allenamento è comunemente misurato in termini di serie, ripetizioni e carico. Diverse ricerche sottolineano che un volume adeguato di resistenza progressiva è fondamentale per stimolare la crescita muscolare. In termini generali, per ottenere ipertrofia, si raccomanda di lavorare in un intervallo di ripetizioni da 6 a 12 per serie, con serie che possono variare a seconda dell'intensità e del livello di esperienza dell'individuo. Un range comune per i principianti o coloro che si allenano per l'ipertrofia può essere da 3 a 6 serie per esercizio. La creazione di uno “stimolo efficace” per la crescita muscolare può essere raggiunta anche con meno ripetizioni (ad esempio 3-5) se il carico è abbastanza pesante (approccio di forza), o con un numero maggiore di ripetizioni (15-20) se il carico è più leggero ma si arriva vicini al cedimento muscolare (allenamento per l'endurance muscolare con possibili benefici ipertrofici). Per quanto riguarda il volume totale settimanale o per sessione, alcune linee guida suggeriscono un range di 10-20 serie per gruppo muscolare a settimana come punto di partenza efficace per la crescita muscolare. Tuttavia, c'è una notevole variabilità individuale su come le persone rispondono all'allenamento, quindi il volume ottimale può variare significativamente da persona a persona. Piuttosto che fissarsi su un numero totale di ripetizioni, è più utile focalizzarsi sulla progressione nel tempo, aumentando il carico, il numero di serie o di ripetizioni o riducendo i tempi di recupero tra le serie. La progressione consente di continuare a stimolare l'adattamento e la crescita muscolare nel tempo. In breve, non esiste un numero \\"magico\\" di ripetizioni necessarie per la crescita muscolare. La chiave è eseguire l'allenamento in maniera consistente e progressiva, prestando attenzione alla tecnica di esecuzione, mantenendo un'alimentazione adeguata e garantendo un buon recupero."},{"prompt":"nel mio workout mi sembra che gli esercizi consecutivi utilizzino gli stessi muscoli. se cambiassi l'ordine per il giorno 1 in qualcosa come 1,4,2,6,3,5?","completion":"Cambiare l'ordine degli esercizi nel tuo programma di allenamento è un ottimo modo per gestire meglio la fatica muscolare e il recupero dei gruppi muscolari coinvolti.

Вот пример скрипта на C#, который запускает несколько анимаций по очереди с использованием корутин: \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections; using UnityEngine; public class AnimationSequencer : MonoBehaviour { // Допустим, у вас есть 2 аниматора для двух разных объектов public Animator animator1; public Animator animator2; // Имена анимаций, которые вы хотите воспроизвести public string animationName1 = \\"Animation1\\"; public string animationName2 = \\"Animation2\\"; private void Start() { // Запускаем корутину для воспроизведения анимаций StartCoroutine(PlayAnimationsSequentially()); } private IEnumerator PlayAnimationsSequentially() { // Включить первую анимацию animator1.Play(animationName1); // Ожидаем ее завершения yield return new WaitForSeconds(animator1.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0).length); // Включить вторую анимацию animator2.Play(animationName2); // Снова ожидаем завершения yield return new WaitForSeconds(animator2.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0).length); // Здесь можно продолжить последовательность, если нужно больше анимаций } } \`\`\` В этом примере, корутина \`PlayAnimationsSequentially()\` запускается при старте компонента и последовательно воспроизводит две анимации, ожидая их завершения перед переходом к следующей. Вы можете добавить дополнительные анимации в последовательность, продолжив цепочку \`yield return\`. Помните, что данный подход предполагает знание о продолжительности каждой анимации, и если анимации переключаются не мгновенно или временная метка анимации начинается не с нуля, вам может потребоваться подстроить время ожидания с помощью дополнительных расчетов."},{"prompt":"только у меня один аниматор в котором 5 анимации и нужно ждать после завершения анимации по 5 секунд","completion":"Если у вас есть один аниматор с несколькими анимациями и вы хотите воспроизвести их по очереди, каждый раз ожидая 5 секунд после завершения анимации, то вы можете модифицировать корутину следующим образом: \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections; using UnityEngine; public class AnimationSequencer : MonoBehaviour { public Animator animator; // Один аниматор для всех анимаций // Массив с именами анимаций public string[] animationNames; private void Start() { // Запускаем корутину StartCoroutine(PlayAnimationsWithDelay()); } private IEnumerator PlayAnimationsWithDelay() { // Проходим по всем анимациям в массиве foreach (string animationName in animationNames) { animator.Play(animationName); // Воспроизводим анимацию // Ожидаем окончания анимации yield return new WaitForSeconds(animator.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0).length); // Ждем еще 5 секунд после окончания анимации yield return new WaitForSeconds(5f); } } } \`\`\` Здесь мы предполагаем, что у вас есть массив строк \`animationNames\`, содержащий имена всех анимаций, которые вы хотите воспроизвести в вашем аниматоре. Корутина \`PlayAnimationsWithDelay\` в цикле воспроизводит каждую анимацию из массива, ожидает её завершения, а затем ожидает ещё 5 секунд перед тем как перейти к следующей анимации. При этом подходе важно, чтобы анимации не перекрывались друг другом. Если у вас в аниматоре настроены переходы между анимациями или используются параметры для воспроизведения анимаций, убедитесь, что они правильно настроены, чтобы не начать следующую анимацию до истечения ожидания."},{"prompt":"нужно убрать foreach и добавить поворот на последней задержке анимации поворот на 90 градусов","completion":"Если вы хотите воспроизвести все анимации по очереди без использования цикла \`foreach\` и добавить поворот объекта на 90 градусов после последней анимации, вы можете выполнить это, вызывая анимации и ожидание последовательно в корутине. Вот пример такой корутины: \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections; using UnityEngine; public class AnimationSequencer : MonoBehaviour { public Animator animator; // Один аниматор для всех анимаций // Массив с именами анимаций public string[] animationNames; private void Start() { // Запускаем корутину StartCoroutine(PlayAnimationsWithDelayAndRotate()); } private IEnumerator PlayAnimationsWithDelayAndRotate() { // Воспроизводим анимации по порядку for (int i = 0; i < animationNames.Length; i++) { animator.Play(animationNames[i]); // Воспроизводим анимацию // Ожидаем окончания анимации yield return new WaitForSeconds(animator.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0).length); // Если это последняя анимация, то добавляем поворот if (i == animationNames.Length - 1) { // Поворачиваем объект на 90 градусов по оси Y transform.Rotate(0, 90f, 0); } // Ждем 5 секунд после каждой анимации yield return new WaitForSeconds(5f); } } } \`\`\` В этом коде мы итерируем через массив \`animationNames\` с помощью простого цикла \`for\`. Для каждой анимации проигрываем анимацию, ожидаем ее окончания, проверяем, является ли она последней в массиве и, если да, поворачиваем объект на 90 градусов, а затем ожидаем 5 секунд перед воспроизведением следующей анимации. Обратите внимание, что поворот объекта происходит сразу после последней анимации, перед задержкой в 5 секунд. Если вы хотите, чтобы поворот происходил после задержки, перенесите вызов \`transform.Rotate\` за вызов \`yield return new WaitForSeconds(5f)\`."},{"prompt":"Правда ли, что в сейчас идет сокращение численности носителей русского языка?","completion":"Согласно некоторым исследованиям и прогнозам, демографические тенденции в России и странах СНГ, где русский язык является родным или вторым языком для большого числа населения, могут указывать на возможное сокращение численности носителей русского языка в будущем. В России и некоторых странах СНГ за последние десятилетия наблюдается снижение рождаемости и увеличение смертности, что приводит к старению населения и его уменьшению. Если эти тенденции будут продолжаться, это может привести к сокращению числа людей, для которых русский язык является родным. Кроме того, в некоторых постсоветских странах после обретения независимости наблюдается усиление национальных идентичностей и языков, что также может влиять на количество и статус русскоязычного населения в этих государствах. В странах Балтии, например, русский язык и его носители испытывают давление со стороны языковой политики, нацеленной на поддержку государственного языка. Тем не менее необходимо иметь в виду, что русский язык всё ещё является одним из самых распространённых языков в мире, а также одним из официальных языков в международных организациях, таких как ООН. Русский язык продолжает быть важным языком культуры, науки, техники и образования. Кроме того, распространение интернета и современных средств коммуникации делает русский язык доступным для изучения и использования людьми по всему миру, что также может влиять на его популярность и использование за пределами традиционного русскоязычного пространства. Таким образом, невозможно однозначно утверждать о сокращении численности носителей русского языка без учета всех этих факторов и актуальных данных. Указанные тенденции могут быть изменены благодаря миграционным процессам, изменениям в образовательной политике, а также внешнеполитическим и экономическим факторам, влияющим на международное положение русского языка."},{"prompt":"привет мне нужно в unity сделать последовательные анимации через Coroutines с условием что только у меня один аниматор в котором 5 анимации и нужно ждать после завершения анимации по 5 секунд и в конце нужно повернуть обьект на 90 градусов","completion":"Привет!

(they used to do it lots of times before, getting him to do housework or *footrubs*; he doesn’t consciously remember any of it!). Ruth is fascinated, excited to think of her own big brother under their total control.

Three women sit on a comfy sofa. 19-year-old RUTH, a picture of curiosity, wiggles her toes on the carpet while LAUREN and VICKY, both in their mid-twenties, regale her with stories from the past. Sunshine filters in through the window, illuminating their animated faces. LAUREN (With a nostalgic laugh) Oh, Dave was such a soft touch back then! You'd be surprised what a couple of soothing words would do to him. VICKY (Joining in the fun) Seriously, Ruth. It was like a magic spell. We'd start talking in this calm, rhythmic way, and Dave would just... melt. Ruth's eyes widen, a mix of disbelief and excitement dancing in them. RUTH (Skeptical but intrigued) You're kidding me! My brother? That easily? LAUREN (With a confident smirk) Watch and learn, kiddo. Lauren stands up and beckons toward the hallway. LAUREN (Calling out) Hey, Dave! Can you come here for a second? DAVE (O.S.) (Sounds distant) Sure, just a sec! Dave strolls into the room, a look of mild curiosity on his face. He glances around, clueless of the plans brewing. DAVE (To Lauren) What’s up? LAUREN (Soft and soothing, with a knowing glance at Ruth and Vicky) Nothing much, just wanted to show you something interesting. Remember our old relaxation exercises from uni days? Dave nods, a half-smile forming, unaware of the trap being laid. DAVE (Yawning slightly) Yeah, they were always good for a laugh. LAUREN (Taking on a hypnotic tone) Why don't you take a deep breath for me, Dave?

Это может случиться, если разделение данных на выборки было сделано так, что валидационная выборка по каким-то особенностям ближе к обучающему набору данных, на котором модель обучалась. 2. **Отбор гиперпараметров**: Если был проведён отбор гиперпараметров (например, с помощью кросс-валидации) на основе валидационной выборки, модель может быть \\"подогнана\\" под эту выборку. 3. **Различие в распределении данных**: Тестовая выборка может иметь другое распределение данных, отличное от обучающей и валидационной выборок. В реальном мире это довольно часто встречается, когда данные нестационарны или когда есть сдвиг в данных (data shift). 4. **Размер выборки**: Валидационная и тестовая выборки могут очень сильно различаться по размеру. Если тестовая выборка значительно больше и разнообразнее, это может привести к увеличению наблюдаемых потерь по сравнению с валидационной выборкой. 5. **Выбросы**: В тестовой выборке могут присутствовать аномалии или выбросы, которые не были представлены или не были хорошо представлены в обучающей и валидационной выборках, что ведет к ухудшению результатов. 6. **Случайность**: Разделение данных на обучающую, валидационную и тестовую выборки в конечном итоге может быть сделано случайным образом. Различные выборки могут случайным образом получить данные, которые либо упрощают, либо усложняют задачу для модели. 7. **Контроль за случайностью**: Не всегда соблюдается строгое контролирование случайных процессов при обучении модели (например, инициализация весов, выбор мини-пакетов). Из-за этого результаты могут незначительно варьироваться. В идеальном случае, для корректного сравнения результатов, как валидационная, так и тестовая выборки должны быть репрезентативными и содержать данные с аналогичными распределениями. Если вы заметили, что результаты на валидационной выборке лучше, чем на тестовой, это может быть признаком одной из перечисленных выше проблем, и, возможно, вам нужно будет пересмотреть процесс разделения данных или проверить, не происходит ли переобучение."},{"prompt":"La “ISBD Crociere” organizza crociere in Mediterraneo, nel Mare del Nord e ai Caraibi e chiede la realizzazione del sistema software della neonata compagnia. Il sistema deve permettere di presentare le proposte di crociera, gestire prenotazioni e vendita e gestire le singole crociere. Ogni crociera è relativa a un tour. Un tour è caratterizzato da un nome, un numero di notti, un porto di partenza, un porto di arrivo, una lista di tappe. Un tour può essere attuato in più date: le crociere relative a un tour differiscono tra loro solo per la data di partenza. Il costo si riferisce al tour “base” e ci sono extra da pagare in base al tipo di cabina (interna/esterna), all’occupazione (singola o doppia), e alle visite guidate durante le tappe (opzionali). Per ogni posto prenotato, sono inseriti il nome e i dati anagrafici del passeggero. Il sistema registra, per ogni passeggero prenotato, la data in cui la prenotazione è stata fatta. Al momento della prenotazione è richiesto un acconto del 20% del costo (base) della crociera, da pagarsi con bonifico o con carta di credito. Il saldo avviene al più tardi sette giorni prima della partenza della crociera stessa. In caso contrario, l’acconto è perso e i posti sono assegnati a eventuali passeggeri in lista d’attesa, che hanno 24 ore di tempo per confermare e perfezionare l’acquisto. Nel caso di cabine doppie, se uno solo dei due passeggeri conferma il viaggio può scegliere se pagare il sovrapprezzo per la singola, oppure trovare un/a nuovo/a compagno/a, che scalerà dal saldo quanto già anticipato dal rinunciatario. Le prenotazioni effettuate negli ultimi sette giorni prima della partenza richiedono l’acquisto immediato dei posti. Sono anche previsti sconti “last-minute”, a discrezione del responsabile vendite. Ogni tour include alcune tappe in località turistiche. In una località turistica possono essere presenti uno o più siti d’elevato interesse storico-artistico. Ogni tour deve comprendere la visita ad almeno un sito d’elevato interesse storico-artistico in ogni tappa. La partecipazione alla visita, come già detto, è onerosa e opzionale e deve essere acquistata al momento del saldo. Domanda 1 Analisi del dominio.

Domanda 2a: Il design pattern che può essere usato per implementare oggetti di tipo Crociera con vari optional è il design pattern Decorator. Domanda 2c: Il pattern Decorator permette di costruire oggetti \\"mal formati\\" in quanto non fornisce un meccanismo di validazione per le combinazioni di decorazioni. Ciò significa che è possibile aggiungere multiple volte lo stesso optional (come \\"cabina uso singola\\") o combinare opzioni che si escludono a vicenda senza che il Decorator verifichi la correttezza di tali combinazioni.

Per dare delle proof obligations per il metodo \`buildCrociera\`, possiamo definire le seguenti classi di equivalenza per ogni parametro: 1. \`usoSingola\` (booleano): - Classe di equivalenza CE1 (true): L'utente sceglie una cabin in uso singola. - Classe di equivalenza CE2 (false): L'utente sceglie una cabin in uso doppia. 2. \`esterna\` (booleano): - Classe di equivalenza CE3 (true): L'utente sceglie una cabina esterna. - Classe di equivalenza CE4 (false): L'utente sceglie una cabina interna. 3. \`visite\` (array di Visita): - Classe di equivalenza CE5: Nessuna visita viene selezionata (array vuoto o tutti gli elementi sono null). - Classe di equivalenza CE6: Una visita viene selezionata (esattamente un elemento non-null nell'array). - Classe di equivalenza CE7: Due visite vengono selezionate (esattamente due elementi non-null nell'array). - Classe di equivalenza CE8: Tre visite vengono selezionate (esattamente tre elementi non-null nell'array). - Classe di equivalenza CE9: Viene fornito un array con più di tre elementi non-null (errore). - Classe di equivalenza CE10: Viene passato un array con una lunghezza incorretta (ad es., meno di 0 o più di 3 posizioni totali, ricordando che si assume un massimo di 3 visite). Proof obligations: - Verifica che il sistema tratti in modo corretto la combinazione di \`usoSingola\` e \`esterna\` per ogni classe di equivalenza CE1, CE2, CE3 e CE4. - Verifica che il sistema accetti un numero di visite conforme alle specifiche, basandosi sulle classi di equivalenza CE5, CE6, CE7 e CE8, e che respinga situazioni di errore definite in CE9 e CE10. Domanda 3.b: Per calcolare il numero di possibili combinazioni di input basato sulle classi di equivalenza di cui sopra, possiamo moltiplicare le possibilità di ogni parametro: - \`usoSingola\`: 2 classi (CE1, CE2) - \`esterna\`: 2 classi (CE3, CE4) - \`visite\`: 4 classi valide (CE5, CE6, CE7, CE8) + 2 classi di errore (CE9, CE10) Le possibili combinazioni di input sono quindi: 2 (usoSingola) x 2 (esterna) x 6 (visite) = 24 possibili combinazioni di input. Domanda 3.c: Se aggiungiamo il vincolo che la cabina esterna è selezionabile se e solo se è selezionata la cabina singola (cabinaEsterna iff cabinaSingola), riduciamo il numero di combinazioni valide perché le classi di equivalenza CE3 e CE4 ora dipendono rispettivamente dalle CE1 e CE2. Di conseguenza, non possiamo più trattare \`esterna\` e \`usoSingola\` come indipendenti. Le possibili combinazioni di input sarebbero: 1 (usoSingola e esterna insieme) x 4 (visite valide) = 4 possibili combinazioni di input (poiché le classi di errore per le visite rimangono invariate e non influenzano questo calcolo)."},{"prompt":"che cambia tra la ce) e la ce10?","completion":"Mi scuso per l'equivoco nella mia spiegazione precedente. Nella descrizione delle classi di equivalenza CE9 e CE10, sembra esserci una sovrapposizione, in quanto entrambe rappresentano situazioni di errore legate a restrizioni sul numero o sulla validità delle visite all'interno dell'array. Cercherò di chiarire: CE9: Potrebbe rappresentare una situazione in cui il sistema considera non valido un array di visite che ha un numero di elementi non-null che superano il limite stabilito per il tour, cioè più di tre visite effettive. Ad esempio, se il sistema si aspetta un massimo di tre visite, un array contenente quattro o più elementi non-null non rispetterebbe questa specifica. CE10: Si riferisce a un errore relativo alla lunghezza dell'array fornito. Questa classe di equivalenza potrebbe includere: - Array con una lunghezza inferiore a zero (che non è possibile in Java, ma potrebbe essere considerata in una verifica formale). - Array di lunghezza maggiore di quella prevista, ad esempio, se il tour può avere massimo tre visite, ma viene fornito un array con più di tre posizioni, anche se alcune di queste sono null. In un nuovo esame, una distinzione più chiara potrebbe essere la seguente: CE9: Array che contiene un numero valido di elementi, ma con più elementi non-null di quelli accettati (rappresenta un sovrannumero di visite rispetto al limite del tour). CE10: Il sistema non dovrebbe accettare un array con una lunghezza minore di quello richiesto, pur sapendo che in Java un array con lunghezza inferiore a zero non è possibile. In altri termini, CE9 riguarda la validità del contenuto dell'array (numero di visite selezionate), mentre CE10 riguarda la lunghezza fisica dell'array rispetto alle aspettative del sistema. Tuttavia, la lunghezza fisica di un array e il numero di elementi non-null che contiene sono due aspetti diversi che possono richiedere la verifica in scenari di errore o eccezioni nel sistema."},{"prompt":"per quanto riguarda questo, Le possibili combinazioni di input sono quindi: 2 (usoSingola) x 2 (esterna) x 6 (visite) = 24 possibili combinazioni di input. è possibile rimuovere ce9 e ce10 dal conteggio visto che so già che danno errore?","completion":"Sì, è corretto escludere CE9 e CE10 dal conteggio delle possibili combinazioni di input per i test se si sta assumendo che vogliamo testare solo combinazioni validi. Come accennato in precedenza, CE9 e CE10 rappresentano casi di errore e non fanno parte delle combinazioni valide che ci aspettiamo che il sistema gestisca in modo regolare. Quindi, se vogliamo contare solo le combinazioni valide di input per il metodo \`buildCrociera\`, considereremo solo quattro classi di equivalenza per le \`visite\`, quelle che rappresentano da zero a tre visite valide come specificato dalla business logic (CE5, CE6, CE7, CE8). Nel caso delle classi di errore CE9 e CE10, esse verranno escluse poiché sono irregularità che si vogliono evitare o gestire separatamente. Ricalcolando senza questi casi di errore: - \`usoSingola\`: 2 classi (CE1, CE2) - \`esterna\`: 2 classi (CE3, CE4) - \`visite\`: 4 classi valide (CE5, CE6, CE7, CE8) Le possibili combinazioni valide di input sono: 2 (usoSingola) x 2 (esterna) x 4 (visite) = 16 combinazioni valide.

Количество чисел, которые делятся на любое данное число k, равно floor(999/k), где floor - это функция, округляющая вниз до ближайшего целого. 1. В диапазоне от 0 до 999 имеется 999/2 = 499.5, следовательно, floor(499.5) = 499 чисел, делящихся на 2. 2. Чисел, делящихся на 3, будет 999/3 = 333. 3. Чисел, делящихся на 5, будет 999/5 = 199.8, следовательно, floor(199.8) = 199. 4. Чисел, делящихся на 7, будет 999/7 ≈ 142.71, следовательно, floor(142.71) = 142. Теперь найдем пересечения, то есть числа, кратные одновременно двум и более числам: - Чисел, делящихся одновременно на 2 и 3 (кратные 6), будет 999/6 = 166.5, следовательно, floor(166.5) = 166. - Чисел, делящихся одновременно на 2 и 5 (кратные 10), будет 999/10 = 99.9, следовательно, floor(99.9) = 99. - Чисел, делящихся одновременно на 3 и 5 (кратные 15), будет 999/15 = 66.6, следовательно, floor(66.6) = 66. - И так далее для всех комбинаций из 2, 3, 5 и 7.

Если общее количество чисел 1000, тогда числа от 1 до 999 - это 999 чисел. Числа, делящиеся на 2, 3, 5 или 7 составит: - Добавим числа, делящиеся на каждое из чисел (\`+ 499 + 333 + 199 + 142\`) - Вычитаем пересечения по парам (\`- 166 - 99 - ...\`) - Добавляем пересечения по тройкам (\`+ 33 + ...\`) - Вычитаем пересечения всех четырех (\`- 4\`) Чтобы найти искомое количество чисел, мы возьмем общее количество чисел (999) и вычтем количество найденных чисел, которые делятся на 2, 3, 5 или 7: 999 - (сумма кратных - сумма пересечений кратных по парам + сумма пересечений кратных по тройкам - ...)

Однако это только по телефону, потому что когда я приехал меня начали торопить, не дали нормально осмотреть машину и повели оформлять договор. Я то был не против, т.к. внешне с машиной все было впорядке. Однако мне не понравилось что сотрудники поставили меня на понт, сказав, что машину можно будет купить только при оформлении документов на доп. Услуги в том числе страховку, которая, к слову, у них стоит недешево. Конечно же я отказался от их предложений, т.к переплачивать несколько десятков тысяч рублей за черт пойми что не готов.

Все мои попытки осмотреть машину внимательно пресекались грубыми \\"нет вам дела до этого\\". Когда я выразил сомнения, менеджер просто фыркнул и сказал: \\"Не нравится – не покупай, других хватает\\". Понятное дело, уходил я оттуда с пустыми руками. С такими продавцами и машина не нужна! 2. Аврора Авто – больше ногой туда не ступлю! Шла за Ладой Грантой, а в итоге получила чудовищный опыт. Продавец так заладил про акцию и специальные цены, что я поверила, хоть интуиция и сигнализировала об обмане. И вот оформили мне автомобиль с явным дефектом краски, якобы \\"это особенность покрытия\\". Пытаюсь добиться ответов, а меня как будто ветром сдуло для них.

Управлять ею – как по полю катить телегу: вся в вибрациях и скрежете. Предпродажная подготовка – фикция, сервис – ниже плинтуса.

Менеджер обещал золотые горы, говорил о бонусах, подарках, но в итоге всё вылилось в один большой обман. Цена, которую озвучили оказалась на 20% выше при оформлении, и каждый из них вдруг стал глух к моим просьбам и вопросам.

LIVING ROOM - DAY The room is cozy and filled with laughter. RUTH, a lively 19-year-old with an infectious smile, sits on the couch. Her feet are bare, her toes occasionally wriggling in excitement. DAVE'S OLD UNI FRIENDS, LAUREN and VICKY, both in their late 20s, are animatedly recounting stories from their university days to Ruth. LAUREN (Chuckling) Oh, you should've seen your brother back then, Ruth. He was like putty in our hands whenever we decided to mess with his head! VICKY (Nodding, giggling) A few simple words, and voila! Dave's out like a light, ready to do whatever silly things we asked of him. RUTH Wide-eyed with curiosity, her feet playfully tapping together. No way! What kind of things would he do? LAUREN Winks mischievously. Oh, the usual. Housework... And footrubs. Believe me, he had quite the magic touch! RUTH (Eagerly) Did he ever realize what was happening? VICKY (Nostalgically) Never! Each time, it was like his memory bank got wiped clean. Just a happy zombie doing whatever we suggested, then back to normal. RUTH Her face lights up with a mixture of awe and mischief. That's wild! Could you... show me how you did it? Lauren and Vicky exchange knowing glances and nod to each other, a silent agreement passing between them. They call out to Dave, who's been flipping through a book in the corner. LAUREN (Yelling) Dave! C'mon over here for a second, will ya? Dave looks up, a gentle smile on his face, and walks over to the group, clueless about what is about to happen. He stands before them, his sister looking up at him with barely contained excitement. LAUREN (Slyly) Hey, remember those relaxation exercises we used to do back in uni? Let's try one now, for old times' sake. DAVE Sometimes it’s nice to relax a bit. (Smiling, indulgently) Sure, why not? LAUREN Her voice shifts into a calm, rhythmic tone. Okay, look at me, Dave. Take a deep breath. Now, as you exhale, just let your eyes close… Dave's smile fades as he follows Lauren's instructions, not realizing her true intent. LAUREN (Calmly, but with authority) That's it, nice and easy. With every breath, feel yourself sinking deeper and deeper. Your mind is going blank... RUTH Leaning forward, fascinated as she watches her brother's face relax into a trance. A mixture of playful glee and curiosity sparkles in her eyes. DAVE His voice is a gentle murmur, compliant and distant. Deeper and deeper... LAUREN (Softly) When you wake up, you're not going to remember any of this, but whenever Ruth tells you to 'relax and sleep,' you'll drop right back into this obedient state. Do you understand? DAVE Obediently. I understand. Lauren snaps her fingers, and Dave blinks, coming back to full awareness, a bit dazed but smiling. DAVE (Rubbing his forehead, chuckling) Wow, that was quite the relaxation exercise. I feel refreshed! RUTH (Can’t contain her excitement) Dave, can I try something? DAVE Sure, what's up? Ruth takes a deep breath, grinning from ear to ear as she echoes Lauren's previous words with her own enthusiastic twist. RUTH (Playfully assertive) Relax and sleep, big brother! Dave's eyes go soft, his body slackens, and he drops into a deep trance once again, much to the delight and amazement of his younger sister. RUTH (Laughing, almost clapping her hands) Oh my gosh, it really works! This is amazing! Lauren and Vicky nod in approval, their expressions a mixture of amusement and satisfaction at having passed along their secret. LAUREN Just remember, it's all in good fun. Make sure you take care of him and bring him back when you're done. We wouldn't want him to miss out on the party, would we? RUTH (Nodding earnestly) I promise! Thank you, this is the best! The scene ends with Ruth pondering all the harmless yet entertaining possibilities now at her fingertips, as Dave remains blissfully unaware, suspended in obedient blankness.

Однако это только по телефону, потому что когда я приехал меня начали торопить, не дали нормально осмотреть машину и повели оформлять договор. Я то был не против, т.к. внешне с машиной все было впорядке. Однако мне не понравилось что сотрудники поставили меня на понт, сказав, что машину можно будет купить только при оформлении документов на доп. Услуги в том числе страховку, которая, к слову, у них стоит недешево. Конечно же я отказался от их предложений, т.к переплачивать несколько десятков тысяч рублей за черт пойми что не готов. В ответ на мой отказ менеджеры начали хамить и говорить, что я отнял у них время. Надеюсь, вас в вашей дыре, уважаемые сотрудники, больше никто не потревожит!","completion":"1. Ужасный опыт покупки в Аврора Авто! Мечтал о Фольксваген Поло, но реальность оказалась кошмаром. Позвонил, договорился, все казалось идеально. Однако приехав в салон, я словно попал в ловушку! Продавцы настолько навязывали страховку и услуги, что я чувствовал себя как на допросе. \\"Берите или уходите\\" – такими были их методы. И конечно, когда я отказался переплачивать, их тон резко изменился. Ребята, я тоже умею ценить деньги и время, не нужно так с людьми! 2. Пришел в Аврора Авто за Шкодой Рапид, ушел с кучей негатива. Часами спрашивал у менеджера по телефону детали, казалось все чисто. А на деле? Они даже не позволили мне спокойно все проверить, так быстро хотели срубить с меня бабки. И когда я засомневался в их \\"выгодном\\" предложении, они начали мне наезжать, будто я враг номер один. В общем, вам, товарищи, надо менять не только отношение к клиентам, но и всю свою мораль! 3. Ну вот зачем так, Аврора Авто? Хотела Ладу Гранту, а получила стопку нервов. Все объясняла по телефону вежливо, но в живую? Менеджеры как на охоте, столпились вокруг, давят контракты, страховки, допы... Прямо скажите, что я для вас только кошелек на ногах! Ушла без авто и с ощущением, что меня просто хотели обмануть. И после моего \\"нет\\" – такие глаза, будто я виновата, что они время потратили. Фу таким быть! 4. Вот это поворот... Киа Серато в салоне Аврора Авто стала моим проклятьем! Хорошо говорят, а на деле – давят, не давая даже взглянуть внимательно на машину. Чужие в вашем кармане роются, страховку заоблачную предлагают... и как только вы отказываетесь – начинается хамство. Просто обалдеть! Меня это не купишь, моя доверчивость испарилась вместе с желанием здесь что-то покупать. 5. С таким сервисом, Аврора Авто, вы далеко не уедете! Меня просто в корень шокировало, как меня \\"встретили\\" при покупке Хендай Солярис. Ответьте на вопрос, зачем обещать волшебство по телефону, если в реале не готовы ни ответить нормально на вопросы, ни дать осмотреть машину? У вас что, секреты Пентагона под капотом?

Cups of coffee rest in their hands as laughter fills the air. RUTH (laughing) No way! You could hypnotize Dave just like that? VICKY Yes! It was almost too easy.

LAUREN (grinning) Oh, nothing. Hey, Dave, come here for a sec, will you? Dave, unsuspecting, walks over to Lauren. LAUREN (softly, to Dave) You look tense. Just relax a second, okay? Dave nods. Lauren starts speaking in a soothing tone, drawing Dave’s attention. Her words are gentle, rhythmic. LAUREN (softly to Dave) Just focus on my voice, and let all your worries fade away. With each word I say, feel yourself getting more and more relaxed... Slowly, Dave’s expression eases into blankness, his eyes glazed over. VICKY (whispers to Ruth) Watch this.

Dave blinks several times, coming out of his trance, looking around, slightly confused but otherwise fine. RUTH Hey, Dave. Ruth locks eyes with Dave and *snaps* her fingers. Instantly, Dave drops back into the trance, his expression once again empty. RUTH (excitedly) Dave, stand up and spin around. Without hesitation, the entranced Dave stands and begins to spin in place. Lauren and Vicky exchange a look of triumph, while Ruth giggles at the sight. LAUREN (to Vicky, sotto voce) Every time, it's just like we're back at uni. VICKY (sotto voce, smirking) We've created a monster. RUTH (reveling, to Dave) Okay, stop. From now on, whenever I snap my fingers, you're going to think you're a famous opera singer. Dave stops spinning and stands at attention, awaiting further instructions. Ruth and her friends are delighted by the control and the new possibilities this opens up. They spend a little while longer having fun with post-hypnotic suggestions before they decide it is time to return Dave to normal.

Well-Storied. Articles Tools Books Coaching Site ArticlesToolsBooks Well-Storied. Coaching Site How to Write Chapters That Captivate Readers So, chapters. It occurred to me the other week that I’d yet to talk about them here on Well-Storied, despite the fact that I’ve been running this show for well over two years now. How could I have skipped something so crucial to the structure of a good novel? I'll be honest. For a long time, I didn't consider chapters to be all that important. Chapters give your novel structure, sure. But over the years, I've come to realize that that's not all they do. Chapters also create a sense of pacing, of forward momentum, and — if you play your cards just right — a sense of page-turning urgency.Chapter breaks aren’t just places for readers to stick their bookmarks. They’re an opportunity for you, the author, to further captivate them! So how can you make sure you’re writing captivating chapters in your own novel? Today, I’m going to break this topic down by answering five of your most popular chapter questions. Let’s go! How long should chapters be?Too short and you may not captivate readers. Too long and you may lose their interest. Finding that perfect Goldilocks length for your chapters may seem tough, but it doesn't have to be! When it comes to literature, standard chapter lengths typically fall between 1,000 and 5,000 words. That’s roughly four to twenty printed pages, with each page containing a standard 250 words. Are there mega popular books with shorter chapters? Sure. Take a look at many of James Patterson’s books. Any fan favorites that have super long chapters? Of course! Many fantasy and sci-fi books have longer chapters, most notably the Game of Thrones series by George R. R. Martin.There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to chapter lengths, and there will always be successful exceptions to industry standards. That said, most readers prefer books with moderately-long chapters, roughly 6 to 10 pages or 1,500 to 2,500 words in length. (I conducted a Twitter poll a loooong time ago to get the above data. Roughly 50 readers weighed in and I wrote these results down, but silly me never noted the link so I could cite it. Sorry, friends!)If you’re trying to decide how long your own chapters should be, I suggest combing through a few popular books in your genre and age market. How long are the chapters? How many chapters are there in the book as a whole? You don’t have to follow the data you collect, but it’s an excellent baseline for knowing what your readers will likely anticipate when picking up your book. Should all chapters be the same length?Generally speaking, yes. Having consistent chapter lengths creates a strong sense of pacing. It allows readers to fall into a rhythm and encourages them to keep turning pages.That said, there are instances where it’s okay to alter the length of a chapter. The key is to do so sparingly, so the change in length actually makes a meaningful impact. Remember folks, everything in your novel must serve a purpose. So what are these special instances? #1: Barreling Toward the Climactic SequenceAs you gear up for the big showdown, you may find yourself naturally increasing or decreasing the length of your chapters. Decreasing chapter length actually increases the pace of your story, so employing this during your story’s climactic sequence can add to the suspense and urgency of your storytelling. Pretty cool, right?Alternatively, you may make your chapters longer in order to fit all the action happening during your story’s climax, and that’s okay too. Lengthening chapters can help engross readers in your story's climax since there aren’t any chapter breaks to steal their attention. #2: Changing Point-of-ViewYou may also wish to change the length of your chapters when briefly visiting the point-of-view of a secondary character. For example, in V.E. Schwab’s A Gathering of Shadows, both the antagonist and his sidekick have a few POV chapters throughout the story, and nearly all of them are much shorter than the main characters’ chapters.Shortening chapter lengths in this instance allows writers to give readers a quick peek into an alternative plot line or POV. This creates dramatic irony — when readers know something the characters do not — which in turn builds suspense. Pretty nifty trick, right? How many scenes should be included in each chapter?Again, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to structuring your chapters. Both the length of your chapters and the narrative choices you make as an author will affect how many scenes you include in each chapter. That said, anywhere from one to five scenes per chapter is fairly common. The good news? You don’t have to worry as much about consistency here!Sometimes scenes are lengthy. Other times they’re quick bites of pertinent info. As long as the pacing of your chapters is on point, you don’t have to worry about whether you’re using the same number of scenes in each one. Can you switch POV characters during a chapter?By starting a new chapter every time you switch point-of-view characters, you negate the risk of confusing readers, which is pretty awesome if you ask me. However, switching POV characters mid-chapter can be done successfully.The key to switching POV characters mid-chapter is to be absolutely clear about the fact that you are switching POVs. This typically means utilizing a scene break (i.e. skipping a line to indicate that one scene — or POV — has ended and another has begun). A few things to keep in mind...Switching heads in a chapter typically makes the most narrative sense at the halfway point, where the first half of your chapter features one POV character and the second half another. The duality of this approach is easy for readers to digest.Another natural point to switch POVs occurs at the very end of a chapter, typically within the last few lines. This usually occurs when authors want to create dramatic irony (giving readers knowledge that the characters don’t have in order to build suspense).For example, imagine that an entire chapter is told through the POV character, Henry, as he steals money from the company safe. Then, imagine the last few lines of the chapter switch to the POV of Henry’s secretary, whom Henry doesn’t realize has just witnessed his crime.See how that creates suspense? Readers will likely feel the immediate urge to turn the page to find out what happens next! How can you create exciting chapter endings?Every chapter ending leaves readers with an ultimatum. Do they continue reading or do they shut the book? It’s your job as the author to convince them to continue on. The easiest way to captivate readers is with a cliffhanger, right? Stop the scene in the middle of the action and readers are forced to continue reading.Well, it turns out that ending too many chapters with a cliffhanger can feel contrived and gimmicky. You don’t want readers to feel like you’re trying to push them along. You want them to be so invested in your story that they don't even question turning the page. But how?Make sure your main character remains unsatisfied. Strange advice, right? Hear me out. With any luck, you’ve already created a strong connection between your reader and your main character. The reader was able to stick themselves in the main character’s shoes and now they've been sucked into the story. If you've done this successfully, putting your main character in a tense and unsatisfied position at the end of each chapter will always leave your readers wanting more. You've created an itch, and now your readers will want to scratch it. But what do I mean when I talk about dissatisfaction? Anything really!An argumentEmotional turmoilPhysical roadblocksAn injuryRelationship issuesAny of these struggles can leave your main character in a place of deep dissatisfaction — think: anger, frustration, confusion, hurt, pain, and so on — and your readers, too!Just remember that you don’t need to cut every chapter off in the middle of a major conflict. Use those cliffhanger moments sparingly, specifically in places where your story's conflict could use a little boost, and they’ll serve a much more powerful purpose. Are you ready to write captivating chapters?As I said a few times throughout the article, there are no true defined rules when it comes to structuring your novel’s chapters. That’s pretty much how most things work when it comes to writing, actually! But that doesn’t mean there aren’t a few norms your readers are already accustomed to.Your book may be the exception, but in most cases, following the basic rules we outlined today will help you write crazy awesome chapters that captivate your readers so efficiently they won’t be able to put your book down.

And no single organization can save it either. That is why everything OpenMedia does is about placing citizens at the heart of digital policy. Our digital future is just too important to be left to industry lobbyists and government bureaucrats. OpenMedia engages, educates, and empowers people through long-term citizen-driven campaigns. For this, it is important to ensure that citizen voices are at the heart of the debate. We ensure citizens can have their say through accessible online actions, innovative participatory tools, and through Internet Town Halls and other events. Having gathered citizen input, we do our utmost to make sure those voices are heard at the heart of government. We do so by appearing at regulatory proceedings, meeting with politicians, creating online tools that make it easy for citizens to take part in regulatory processes, and by leveraging media coverage to encourage decision-makers to listen to citizens. Working with Canadians, OpenMedia has developed crowd-sourced, informed, in-depth research that shapes our policy plans. This approach is having a real impact and has led to a signiﬁcant improvement in recent years in terms of how the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunica- tions Commission (CRTC) listens to Canadians. Imagine it is the year 2020 and you’ve been having a frustrating day. You’ve just been stopped at the border—the US guard wouldn’t tell you why, but you guess it is because of something you said or did online recently. They collect so much data on your everyday life these days that it’s diﬃcult to know what, or why they red-ﬂagged you. It’s been happening to a lot of your friends recently too (Bridge 2011). Returning home, you log on to your Internet account. It’s costing you over two hundred Canadian dollars a month for this, and some days you wonder why you bother. You still enjoy connecting with people, but so much content is oﬀ limits nowadays that your Internet is feeling more and more like cable TV (Isaacson 2014). That extra twenty-dollar monthly fee to access Facebook still annoys you—and you just can’t ﬁnd the money needed to access online news content other than from your sensationalist local TV station. At least that sta- tion comes as part of your Internet package because it is owned by your pro- vider—but to access the BBC would be an extra twenty-ﬁve dollars a month, and your provider blocks access to other online news portals completely. Checking your e-mail, you discover a threatening letter (Brown 2013) from a US media giant. It seems to have something to do with a song your six-year-old niece accidentally downloaded when she visited a few months ago. The e-mail warns that under copyright rules negotiated under a previous Trans Paciﬁc Partnership, you will be kicked oﬀ the Internet entirely if it happens again (Desjardins 2013), and now you’ve got to pay an extortionate ﬁne to avoid getting taken to court. At the same time, you are acutely aware that storing everything everyone says or does online in giant government databases comes at a cost to taxpayers. And you’re constantly worried that you’ll be the victim of a massive leak of your private data (Bennett 2014)—it seems the government just can’t keep anything secure. You fondly remember the good old days, where you could read and connect privately with whoever you wanted online. It hasn’t been like that for years— not since those old net neutrality rules were struck down and your Internet provider started blocking or charging extra for content it didn’t own. And you have no option outside the high-cost Big Telecom Internet providers since they succeeded in blocking you from more aﬀordable, independent services. You wonder why you didn’t make more of a fuss about that at the time. Does all this sound terrifying? Thankfully, we are still some way oﬀ from this dystopian vision of the future. But we are already on a very slippery slope and this is exactly what the Internet could look like in a few years if citizens step back and leave digital policy to telecom lobbyists and spy agency bureaucrats. OpenMedia exists to stop this from happening—it is an award-winning community-based organization that safeguards the possibilities of the open Internet. We work toward informed and participatory digital policy by engag- ing hundreds of thousands of people in protecting our online rights. We do this work because digital policy aﬀects each and every one of us. Our high cell phone bills are holding back our economy and Canada as a whole. Mass surveillance of law-abiding citizens has grown secretive, expensive, and out-of-control—stiﬂing free speech in Canada and overseas. And supposed trade deals negotiated behind closed doors contain extreme Internet censorship rules that would seriously undermine citizens’ ability to communicate freely online. If we stood back and did nothing then at best we’d end up with an Internet that was far more expensive, locked down, censored, and policed. And, if recent challenges in the United States to net neutrality are anything to go by, we may not even have an Internet at all—at least not as we know it today. That’s why, at OpenMedia, we work for digital policies that make sense for all users of the Internet—policies that help build the open, connected society we all deserve. CASE STUD Y OF A SUCCESSFUL REFORM STRATEGY Our campaign on reshaping Canadian wireless policy oﬀers a compelling example of how the OpenMedia community works to bring about positive change. Canadians pay some of the highest prices in the industrialized world for often patchy and unreliable wireless service. This has been conﬁrmed time and again by independent reports (Christopher 2013). Many Canadians have no choice but to pay the high prices on oﬀer by the Big Three: Bell, Rogers, and Telus. These three providers control over 90 percent of the market, meaning many Canadians have no independent options whatsoever. In January 2012, we launched the “Stop the Squeeze” campaign, which urged Canadians to speak out against the Big Three’s near-oligopoly. As part of this campaign we launched an online petition—along with videos, post- ers, and viral share images—to equip Canadians with the tools needed to speak up and pressure decision-makers. Over sixty-ﬁve thousand Canadians took part and in October 2012 the CRTC announced a public consultation to create new national rules for wireless services. At OpenMedia we wanted to make sure that these reﬂected the lived realities of Canadian cell phone users. We created a new online tool to enable Canadians to share their cell phone horror stories about the eﬀect high wireless prices and poor service had on their daily lives. Over three thousand submissions were received through this campaign— some of which consisted of multiple pages detailing remarkable mistreatment at the hands of the Big Three. A common complaint was from Canadians returning home after trips to the United States or overseas to receive staggering bills for roaming charges. This citizen input was used to create a crowdsourced report entitled Time for an Upgrade (OpenMedia 2013) that reﬂected how Canadians wanted to see the wireless market reformed. During a crowdsourced presentation to the CRTC, the key themes of this report were reinforced: lower prices, greater choice, and better service. Canadians were kept informed via live tweets and online updates from the CRTC hearing. OpenMedia focused on making the case that any new wireless code of conduct must be grounded in the evidence-based realities that our campaign had high- lighted. In June 2013 this work paid oﬀ—the CRTC announced a broadly posi- tive new set of customer protection rules (Rennie 2013) that capped data roaming rates, shortened contracts, and made it easier to switch to a new provider. By this time, it seemed that decision-makers were starting to listen to Cana- dians but there was still a long way to go. Despite these new customer protec- tions, independent reports revealed that wireless prices were still increasing at thirteen times the rate of inﬂation (CNW 2013). Canadians were also con- cerned about attempts by large telecom providers such as Rogers and Telus to take over scarce wireless spectrum resources that had been set aside for inde- pendent providers. As focus shifted from customer protections to the need for greater wireless choice, over forty leading Canadian innovators and entrepreneurs spoke out to tell Industry Canada that high prices were stiﬂing job creation and holding Canada’s economy back. Responding to this pressure, the government announced new rules (Industry Canada 2013) to help prevent the Big Three from taking over independent providers. With a new industry minister, James Moore, taking oﬃce we encouraged Canadians to send a message asking him to stop the Big Three acting as gate- keepers to resources that were essential for Canada’s economy. We underlined the need for the government to listen to Canadians, whose crowdsourced roadmap called for opening the wireless networks to deliver real aﬀordability and choice. Once again, citizen pressure delivered results, with the new indus- try minister promising to take modest steps to ensure independent providers could access wireless networks at an aﬀordable rate (Market Wired 2013), along with ﬁnancial penalties for telecom giants who break the rules. Notably, the government has eﬀectively staked its reputation on delivering “more choice and lower prices”—even launching a government website and a TV ad cam- paign to underline this goal. This would never have happened without citizens speaking out en masse and working together to provide a positive roadmap for policy change. THE INTERNET IS KE Y TO B UILDING A PA RTICIPATORY SHARED SOCIET Y OpenMedia has seen again and again that when people speak up en masse, it really does make a diﬀerence—delivering real results and positive change. The common theme with all our successful campaigns is our emphasis on citizen participation. Our community is placed at the heart of everything OpenMedia does—whether that is crowdsourcing reports, policy plans, presentations, and even meetings with government ministers. When designed well, OpenMedia’s campaigns eﬀectively act as platforms for broad-based citizen engagement and collaboration. It is important to ensure that citizens play the key role in shaping campaigns, from messaging and tactics all the way to long-term policy solutions. Time after time, it is citizens’ decisions to participate in campaigns that has ultimately led to their success. Together, our growing community has accomplished some remarkable things in a short period of time—whether overturning invasive government spying schemes or stopping pans to install a pay meter on the Internet. Sadly, the need for OpenMedia’s work has not diminished. Eﬀorts to spy on private online activity, to censor the Internet, and to price-gouge Canadians on their monthly Internet bills make clear that the Internet continues to need people who are willing to work to defend it. By coming together online, citi- zens are demonstrating why the Internet is key to a future where collaboration and participation are hallmarks of our democracy. We are really just beginning to explore the Internet’s potential for building a democracy that truly responds to citizens’ needs. With threats to the Internet intensifying, it seems that we are at a tipping point: Either we stand back and let leaders, bureaucrats, and lob- byists tip us back into disempowerment, or we step forward to build a partici- patory shared future that works for all of us.","completion":"# CHAPTER NINE: Working Toward an Open Connected Future By David Christopher, OpenMedia, Canada MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY - Introduction to OpenMedia's mission - Citizen-driven campaigns for digital policy - The importance of public participation in shaping government decisions - OpenMedia's success in influencing CRTC's approach Challenges of the Current Digital Landscape - Hypothetical scenario describing the restrictions and challenges in 2020 - High costs and limited access to internet services - The impact of outdated digital policies CASE STUDY OF A SUCCESSFUL REFORM STRATEGY - \\"Stop the Squeeze\\" campaign for better wireless policy in Canada - Crowdsourcing Canadian cell phone users' experiences - Impact of the campaign on new wireless service regulations by the CRTC THE INTERNET IS KEY TO BUILDING A PARTICIPATORY SHARED SOCIETY - OpenMedia's emphasis on citizen participation - A call to action to defend the internet against privacy, censorship, and cost issues - The internet as a tool for democratic engagement and participatory governance --- Summary: David Christopher from OpenMedia outlines their efforts to ensure Canadian citizens have a fundamental role in the creation of digital policy.

During this time AMEDI has developed a number of eﬀective strategies, which include: constant advocacy, by organizing conferences and symposiums, providing relevant information through their website and public communiques and cementing an eclectic but uniﬁed front against media power; permanent monitoring, by identifying in National Congress all MPs with close personal or professional connections to big media and evaluating the performance of media regulators and key civil servants; strategic litigation, by ﬁghting in court commer- cial transactions carried out by media corporations which could further entrench media concentration and contesting in the Supreme Court of Justice the constitu- tionality of particular pieces of legislation; and research and policy-making exer- cises, by publishing academic books and drafting media law to be submitted for legislative consideration. Alongside an advantageous political environment and the pressure asserted by a dynamic student movement, these strategies have been responsible for the 2013 telecommunications reform and the transformation of the legal framework regulating media in Mexico. For the ﬁrst time in half a century, the legal framework regulating media in Mexico has been comprehensively reformed. A number of far-reaching constitutional amendments approved in June 2013 will radically change the way radio and television are regulated in the country, opening up a highly monopolized market and raising the possibilities for the creation of a national public broadcasting service. Among the most relevant changes brought up by this reform was the creation of the Federal Institute of Tele- communications (IFT to use its Spanish acronym), a new regulator which, unlike its predecessor, is constitutionally independent from both the Presi- dency and Congress. The IFT will have the authority to implement asym- metric regulation and the tools to impose multi-million peso ﬁnes. IFT will have both ﬁnancial and administrative independence and their commission- ers are now selected through a publicly sanctioned process. In a country in which radio and television was born out of the intimate connections between a small number of aﬄuent families and politicians, these reforms represent an attempt to sever the murky and, at times, illegal connections between media moguls and government oﬃcials. Perhaps more importantly, the 2013 telecommunications reform recognize the duty of the state in the creation of a diverse and plural media environment: both the right to information and the right to access to information and com- munication technologies (ICT) are now constitutional prerogatives. In addi- tion, a number of previously inoperable laws, from the right to reply to the laws protecting personal privacy, are to be harmonized in new secondary legis- lation. Although the laws necessary to implement these far-reaching reforms have yet to be developed, most social commentators and academics recognize the unprecedented possibilities these reforms will bring to the media ecology of the country. This chapter, however, does not explore the particularities of these constitutional reforms, but focuses instead on the sociopolitical circumstances that made them possible and, in particular, on the strategies used by Mexican Association for the Right to Information (AMEDI), the largest and most ener- getic media reform group in the country. As Silvio Waisbord (2000, 50) has rightly pointed out, like in most other Latin American countries, radio and television in Mexico was for many years caught between “the hard rock of the state and the hard place of the market.” At the dawn of broadcasting technologies, the countries of the region—ruled by military regimes or by authoritarian political elites—adopted a liberal media model which left to the market the introduction and operation of these new services. In fact, political control over radio and television was a key element in the longevity of these administrations; this inﬂuence, however, was not exer- cised through direct ownership or management. In postrevolutionary Mexico, broadcasting was controlled through a complex system of patronage and com- mercial links, in which media owners were allowed to conduct their commer- cial aﬀairs undisrupted as long as they showed unquestionable loyalty to the hegemonic party and in particular to the president in turn. When comparing media systems, Hallin and Papathanassopoulos (2002) use the term clientelism to describe the way countries in southern Europe and Latin America organize their media industries; they describe media systems in which “access to social resources is controlled by patrons and delivered to clients in exchange for defer- ence and various kinds of support” (ibid., 184–185). The combination of the unﬂinching backing from authoritarian regimes and the ﬁnancial resources generated by thinly regulated markets produced a num- ber of extremely wealthy and powerful corporations. By the mid-1970s, a hand- ful of groups in Mexico owned most radio stations in the country and the Azcárraga family had total control over most television stations. In 1990 Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, father of Emilio Azcárraga Jean, current CEO of Televisa, famously declared himself to be “a solider of the party” (Fernandez and Pax- man 2013). All through the twentieth century, the Azcárraga family maintained strong connections to the leadership of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI to use the Spanish abbreviation), the hegemonic organization which ruled Mexico for 70 years. These links allowed the company to fend oﬀ any attempt to modify the archaic laws which supposedly regulated their industry. In fact, as María de la Luz Casas Pérez (2006, 96) has suggested, media regula- tion almost always “appeared by request [of the media corporations] in order to formalize already existing favourable conditions or to ensure their future stability.” Politicians and academics (Esteinou and de la Silva 2009; Trejo Delarbre 2009) have even implied that pieces of media legislation were often written by the legal department of Televisa rather than by elected MPs. In Mexico, unlike other countries in the region, the slow process toward democracy which began in the late 1980s and accelerated during the 1990s, was not wholeheartedly supported by any major media corporation. As Hallin (2000, 103) has stated, Televisa actively resisted democratization and most “commercial broadcasters, far from leading the charge to pluralism, had to be dragged kicking and screaming by the state.” Media companies dreaded a decline in inﬂuence a diﬀerent political party could bring and kept their options open. However, the adoption of a multiparty system in which electoral results were respected and the balance of power eﬀectively shifted did very little to curtail their inﬂuence on the political and social life of the country. The fact they never fully adopted an ideological position and pursued instead purely commercial interests, allowed most of the largest corporations to be ﬂexible enough to cozy up to all parties, including opposition forces which relied on publicity to be elected. Rather than auguring media plurality and the decentralization of the media market, the 2000 presidential election in which the PRI was ﬁnally ousted, tragically increased the power of these corporations. In pursuit of the media exposure considered vital for electoral victory, politicians of all parties tried to outbid each other in the purchase of airtime. This dynamic, alongside hefty contracts for political advertising, gave media lobbyists huge political lever- age. In the following decade, media corporations were not afraid to use this inﬂuence, pushing outrageous legislation through their proxies in Congress; for example, they forced the president to slash their taxes by 1,000 percent (Trejo Delarbre 2010; Esteinou and de la Silva 2009). By the 2006 presidential election the entire political class was eﬀectively being blackmailed by Televisa, the largest Spanish-speaking media cooperation in the world. THE SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXT BEHIND MEDIA REFORM In the last couple of years, a number of Latin America countries, from Argentina to Nicaragua, have fundamentally changed the way they regulate and organize their media. Just like in Mexico, many of these changes were, at least in part, the result of a sustained campaign by media reform groups. Activists, academics and university students began to create organizations that strived to democratize the media and make the connections between authorities and media owners pub- licly accountable. The Latin American media observatories, which Maria del Mar Rodríguez Rosell and Beatriz Correyero Ruiz (2008, 23) describe as “orga- nizations which deliver a critical look at the global media system and have as a common objective its democratization,” diﬀer from country to country (Her- rera 2005; Rey 2003) but the great majority of them shared a “reformist agenda” (Herrera 2006). These organizations have been at the forefront of all major media reform movements in the region and are a rich environment in which alternative models of media production and distribution are tested. However, unlike other countries in South and Central America (Waisbord 2010), no Mexican media observatory has been fully endorsed by a political party and comprehensive media reform has never been part of any government’s agenda. Contrary to countries like Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Ven- ezuela, in which populist governments “dovetail with longstanding demands by civic groups, namely, the need to restrict the power of large media corporations and diversify media ownership” (ibid., 99), Mexican reform groups had only limited inﬂuence within the established political system. It was therefore some- what surprising to witness the scope and progressive outlook of the 2013 tele- communications reform. Before concentrating on the strategies employed by the most prominent media reform group in the country, this section explores two sociopolitical events that might help to explain such a dramatic change. Alongside the strategies used by AMEDI, the YoSoy132 (IAm132) student movement and the return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party to the presi- dency are key elements that help to explain the recent legal transformations. THE CONNECTIvE LOGIC OF YOSOY 132 YoSoy132 is a student movement that erupted two months before the 2012 presidential election. The result of an incident which took place at a private university, the movement was a popular reaction to a political snub: a group of students who demonstrated against the visit of Enrique Peña Nieto, the then front-runner in the presidential race and today’s Mexican president, were pub- licly called hooligans and political pawns by members of his campaign. In what would become very relevant, not only did the major television channels distort their grievances and opinions but they questioned their identities as students. Using mobile phone recordings, the students at the Iberoamerican University (Ibero) contested the oﬃcial version of events by posting a number of videos on YouTube and ﬂooding social media with their own account. On May 14, three days after the incident, 131 protesters posted a video in which they showed their student IDs and conﬁrmed their presence in the original protest. This video not only went viral, but was soon picked up by radio and television sta- tions, if not by the largest corporations. This video “would end up shaking the electoral atmosphere like nothing else before, in a presidential campaign which had given the impression to be immobile” (Galindo Cáceres and Gonzáles- Acosta 2013, 83). When students at other universities began to be aware of the movement and identify with it, they considered themselves to be the 132nd protester, even if they had only been virtually there. They used the YoSoy132 hashtag to make their struggle public through the use of social media but also to identify themselves as joveNets, or networked-youngsters (Candón Mena 2013), the young “digital natives” who are proﬁcient in the use of digital tech- nologies and are not passive consumers of “old media.” Although the movement soon took to the streets and organized regional rallies and assemblies, YoSoy132 followed what Lance Bennett and Alexandra Segerberg (2012) have described as the logic of connective action. By adopting horizontal methods of decision-making and heavily relying on social media for making their struggle public, the movement escalated exponentially and gained central stage in the political agenda. With its use of “easily personalized ideas” (ibid., 744) and its rejection of hierarchies, the students were able to generate an incredible momentum which took politicians and social commentators by surprise. By May 23, just over a week after the ﬁrst incident, tens of thousands of young protesters marched through Mexico City and held a massive assembly near the city center. Not all protesters identiﬁed themselves as members of the YoSoy132 movement (Meneses Rocha, Ortega Gutiérrez, and Urbina Cortés 2013), but it was precisely the ideological ﬂexibility of the movement and its lack of formal membership which allowed the formation of an eclectic group, able to accommodate diverse and dissimilar demands: from calling for an end to the War on Drugs to demanding respect and legal protection for unionized labor. Nevertheless, and despite having no formal leadership to script a manifesto or a coherent set of demands to present to Congress, media democratization soon became the core exigency of the movement; it became the only idea that bonded all protesters together. Rather than directing their outrage against a particular political party or candidate, most students identiﬁed mainstream media, and in particular Televisa and TV Azteca, as the main target and the biggest threat to the democratic process. As Gabriel Sosa Plata (2012, 103) has clearly described: “Why do young people talk about the need to democratize media? Because, as a matter of fact, television is an overwhelming presence in all Mexican homes, in particular the two companies [which control most of the airwaves]. No other media has these levels of penetration, coverage and national reach.” The students considered media corporations a vestige of an undemocratic and authoritarian past which they no longer recognized and began to employ digital technologies as organizational tools while at the same time using social media as performative acts of resistance. During demonstrations students hold banners with slogans such as: “They have the TV, we have social networks” and “Televisa: Welcome to the Digital Age!” In an interesting twist of events, the demographic who consumed traditional broadcasting content the least—the young, metropolitan, tech-savvy university student—was the sector of society that recognized radio and television stations as important centers of political power. Even without setting up a detailed action plan or developing a clear political agenda, YoSoy132 was crucial in bringing media reform to the fore. Nonetheless, without the endorsement of the political elite, far-reaching amendments to the Constitution would have never been possible, even after a popular protest of such a scale. Taking this into consideration, the election of Enrique Peña Nieto and his subsequent political maneuvering are crucial to understand the circumstances which made media reform possible. THE RETURN OF THE pRI One of the most intriguing aspects of the 2013 telecommunications reform is the fact it was not only encouraged but actively supported by Peña Nieto. The changes to the Constitution, which might seriously jeopardize the interests of media owners, were sponsored by a politician widely considered to be in cahoots with the media, particularly with Televisa. Even before running for the presidency, Peña Nieto made use of radio, television, and print media as key elements in his political strategy, spending millions in advertising during his time as governor of the State of Mexico. He relied very heavily on public rela- tions and fostered close links to the owners of radio and television stations (Villamil 2009). In November 2010 these connections became personal, when Peña Nieto married Angélica Rivera, a successful soap opera actress with a very long history of working for Televisa. Arguably, one of the reasons which made Peña Nieto decide to push for media reform during its ﬁrst year in oﬃce was an attempt to clean up his image and distance himself from the corporations that helped him to get elected. During the seventy years the PRI controlled the country, it was often the case that when a new president took oﬃce, an element of the old administration had to be sacriﬁced in order to maintain legitimacy. The recent reforms have been seen by some as an act of legitimization (Calleja 2013; Sosa Plata 2013). A more direct factor in the political support shown for these reforms was the Pact for Mexico (Pacto por México), a political agreement signed by leaders of the three main political parties days after Peña Nieto took oﬃce. The pact seeks “to accomplish reforms that have been obstructed by political gridlock” (Sada 2013) and listed a number of areas in which all parties agreed to work together. The pact aimed at speeding up the law-making process by establishing a com- mittee in charge of drafting legislation with cross-bench support and giving them legislative priority. Although fraught with diﬃculties, the agreement allowed for a relatively smooth transition through Congress and prompted the 2013 Telecommunications Reforms to be approved in record time. It is to expect that without this political environment, all the eﬀorts of an engaged civil society would still have not been enough to produce the changes recently experienced in the country. Nevertheless, it is vital to recognize the work done by academics and media activists who for the last twenty years have worked for such reforms. Without their input, the perfect storm which encouraged this change would have never produced such a promising transformation. THE MEXICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION Instead of enforcing control through coercion, the PRI was skilled in subsum- ing dissent through collusion. During most of its time in power, the party could accommodate diverse and contrasting interests, from peasant’s move- ments to chambers of commerce, within its ﬂexible hierarchy. It diﬀused con- ﬂict by granting positions within its structure to every potential opponent, while strongly prosecuting those who rejected. Although there were moments of violent repression, most famously the 1968 student massacre at the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, Mexico escaped most of the killings and disappearances com- mon to other regimes in the region. This culture of collusion made the devel- opment of civil society organizations particularly diﬃcult, since it undermined possibilities for organized political resistance. Nevertheless, since the mid-1990s civic participation and public engagement have started to play a larger role in the process of policy making. Successive Mexican governments, slowly and sometimes grudgingly, have begun to open “windows of opportunity” (Merino 2013) for the engagement of civil society in matters of public concern. It is in this new environment that media reform groups have begun to operate. For over a decade, AMEDI has been the most eﬀective media observatory in the country, calling politicians and media owners to account and promoting media plurality as an essential element in the construction of democracy. With many of the characteristics shared by other Latin American observatories (Beas Oropeza 2007; Correyero 2008), the association has been able to combine academic research with political advocacy, drawing together scholars, politi- cians, and journalists. AMEDI inherited a long history of research and radical action, rooted in the democratic struggles of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1999, after yet another failed attempt to push through Congress a comprehen- sive set of media reforms, a small group of academics, activists, and legislators decided to set up an organization that would “promote total respect, by gov- ernment as well as by the media, to the citizen’s rights to information, which must ensure that all Mexicans have access to truthful and objective information regarding matters of public concern” (AMEDI 2010). In a recent interview, two of its founding members, Senator Javier Corral and Professor Beatriz Solis, admitted creating AMEDI as an antidote to the inﬂuence the media lobby were able to exert on government. Until then, every attempt to modernize the laws regulating radio and television in the country had been defeated by the coordinated eﬀorts of the media corporations. Not only was every bill pub- licly and gratuitously attacked, often without even superﬁcial analysis, but the individuals sponsoring them soon became open targets. Televisa and TV Azteca were particularly vicious against any politician ﬂoating the idea of changing the media framework that, for half a century, had guaranteed their inﬂuence and wealth. Although commercial rivals, these two corporations have proven to be, time and time again, staunch political allies every time their interests are threatened. SOME AMEDI STRATEGIES Since its inception, AMEDI has made use of a variety of methods; I will focus my attention only on four of its most successful strategies: its advocacy, its work monitoring Congress and the civil service, its use of strategic litigation, and its research and policy-making eﬀorts. These tactics are often merged for speciﬁc campaigns; nonetheless they are suﬃciently distinct as to be described separately. Alongside the popular student movement and the favorable political atmosphere experienced after the 2012 presidential election, it is my contention that these strategies are responsible for the shape and scope of the 2013 telecom- munications reform. Perhaps the most important policy employed by AMEDI is its total commit- ment to public advocacy; no other organization has been able to promote media reform to such an extent. It has long been able to build high levels of social awareness and provide a clear alternative to the current paradigm. Part of this success is due to its diverse and committed membership, drawn from the entire political spectrum, who have been able to maintain pressure and a uni- ﬁed front even during the most adverse political times. AMEDI has become an ideological and political safe haven in which MPs, activists, and academics can openly discuss ideas without fear of censorship or peer pressure; consequently, it has become a fertile ground for cross-party cooperation. In addition, its members have developed a strong sense of identity which allows them to coor- dinate their eﬀorts eﬀectively. AMEDI’s members have also a permanent presence in the media, with regular columns in major newspapers and constant appearances in radio and television programs. The association produces and broadcasts Espacio AMEDI (2014), a weekly radio program which works as a platform for their campaigns while introducing topics such as freedom of information, participative democracy, and the right to information. It compiles a weekly newsletter in which all major media topics are discussed and which includes links to news- paper articles. In a country in which media issues are scattered around and diﬃcult to ﬁnd, this is a vital resource for anybody interested in the subject. The public recognition and trajectory of many of its members and support- ers—including well-known actors, respected ﬁlmmakers, and famous writ- ers—has given AMEDI considerable reputational resources. It is generally acknowledged as a serious, committed, and plural organization and its mem- bers possess considerable inﬂuence over key decision-makers, both in the business community and in Congress. However, its strategies go beyond inﬂicting “reputational costs” (Hevia de la Jara 2013), and many of their ideas are now central in debates around media reform. A second strategy used by AMEDI is the constant monitoring of major deci- sion makers, key policy players and relevant civil servants. Although it employs only a couple of full-time staﬀ and most of its members freely give their time and expertise, the association has been able to maintain regular oversight of Congress and all institutions with a stake in the legal framework of the media. Although it has been described as a media observatory, content analysis has yet to become an important element in its overall strategy. Instead, AMEDI has traditionally relied on quantitative research conducted independently by its members or on work done by other organizations, such as the Citizen Observa- tory for Gender Equality in the Media (Observatorio Ciudadano por la Equidad de Género en los Medios), which invites audiences to monitor sexist content on Mexican media. For a detailed analysis of state expenditure on oﬃcial publicity, AMEDI has relied on the Centre for Analysis and Research (Fundar). The asso- ciation can therefore be better described as a “political media observatory” or, following Consuelo Beas Oropeza’s (2007) classiﬁcation, as an observatory for supervision (observatorio de ﬁscalización). Interestingly, AMEDI asks its supporters, and Mexican society in general, to take part in their monitoring eﬀorts. After the 2012 general election, the asso- ciation launched the Telecracy is not Democracy! (¡Telecracia no es democracia!) campaign. This program identiﬁed members of Congress with close connec- tions to the media corporations and analyzed their individual legislative output as an exercise in accountability. The campaign identiﬁed a distinct and hetero- geneous group of MPs, from relatives of media owners and lawyers previously employed by the corporations to former daytime presenters (MultimediA- MEDI 2012). AMEDI christened this group Telebancada (the Television Bench) and used this campaign to inform citizens about these connections and invite anybody interested to follow their legislative record. The campaign also showed how, in most cases, these MPs were not directly elected but accessed Congress through rules of electoral proportionality. Similarly, AMEDI monitored the appointment of all the new members of the Federal Institute of Telecommunication. It not only closely followed the process itself but also led a public scrutiny of the successful candidates. Unfor- tunately, on its ﬁrst assessment, the association has concluded that four out of the seven commissioners did “not comply with the required experience and/or independence established by the Constitution” (AMEDI 2013). Although this type of monitoring does not always stop wrongdoings or bring the changes it advocates, it represents a method of accountability and a challenge to the deci- sions taken away from public scrutiny. The work done by AMEDI is an example of how the value of accountability can be institutionalized within a national media system. Strategic litigation has become another very successful strategy against attempts to further concentrate the media and telecommunication market in Mexico. AMEDI has ﬁled lawsuits and undertaken legal actions against the largest media corporations as a disruptive technique, forcing them to publicly defend some of their most dubious deals and sometimes even demonstrating the collusion between judges and media owners. The association has even chal- lenged the constitutionality of a number of bills introduced to Congress by their proxies: AMEDI’s most signiﬁcant legal victory to date has been the overturning of a number of reforms rushed through Parliament in 2006 in the midst of a hotly contested presidential election. The Televisa Law (Ley Televisa), as these reforms were dubbed at the time, attempted to modify “the Federal Law on Radio and Television” and would have expanded the dominance of Televisa and TV Azteca into areas of telecommunication and Internet provi- sion, granting them an unfair advantage in the process of digitalization (Estei- nou and de la Silva 2009). Among other concessions, Ley Televisa would have allowed for an automatic renewal of all media licenses and extended their validity from ﬁfteen to twenty years. It would have given existing corporations the possibility to fully exploit the dividends of digital switch-over, exempting them from additional taxation and making the appearance of new competitors extremely diﬃcult. In a highly monopolized market these concessions would have further entrenched the inﬂuence of the media duopoly. In 2007, alongside other organizations and a number of MPs, AMEDI suc- cessfully challenged an act of unconstitutionality at the Mexican Supreme Court, nullifying Ley Televisa and paving the way for the 2013 telecommunica- tions reform. In addition, the publicity surrounding the litigation was a power- ful vehicle for the socialization of media reform and demonstrated how the courts were a viable space in which to challenge the corporations and their political allies. Since then, AMEDI has continued to use lawsuits to advance its agenda. It has, for example, recently challenged the purchase by Televisa of 50 percent of mobile phone company Iusacell, on the basis that TV Azteca, its sole competitor in free-to-air commercial television, already owns the other 50 percent. This alliance would have created a dangerous and unconstitutional connection between the two major producers of media content in the country. Although the lawsuit was admitted by the courts, it was summarily dismissed due to legal technicalities; the Supreme Court has unfortunately shown no interest in further pursuing the case (AMEDI 2012), but there is now a prece- dent to follow. Aleida Calleja, who vigorously employed these tactics during her time as AMEDI’s president, is very clear on eﬀectiveness of litigation as a strategy to further the cause of media reform: I am convinced that to acquire new rights you have to litigate. Denouncing is not enough. I do not trust Congress. You have to win [these new rights] through facts on the ground. You need to make these topics public and then assert a legal precedent in court; this would inhibit illegal conduct by the corporations. You could shout and yell outside their oﬃces and nothing will happen. If we manage to succeed with these lawsuits, we will have strength- ened our position. (Calleja 2012) An additional element in AMEDI’s strength resides in the fact that many media scholars in the country—alongside reputed legal experts, historians, and economists—are either members or supporters. The intellectual rigor of their contributions have been captured in the scholarly books AMEDI has published and the international conferences it has organized. Most publications (Ávila Pietrasanta, Calleja, and Solís Leree 2001; Bravo 2011; Solís Leree 2000; Trejo Delarbre et al. 2009; Trejo Delarbre and Montiel 2011) are edited volumes in which policy is carefully discussed and possible alternatives are delineated. As done by other media observatories in Latin America, AMEDI has positioned itself half way between a pressure group and a policy think-tank. The loyalty of its members is in part due to the clarity of its objective and the perceived illegal- ity of the actions of its opponents. Through their members and supporters in Congress, the association has gained working knowledge not only on policy making but also of the politics behind constitutional reform. All these skills have been put to practice in the drafting of a bill, which in turn has been submitted to Congress for consideration. The Citizens’ Bill for a Convergent Law on Broadcasting and Telecommunication (Iniciativa Ciudadana de Ley Convergente en Materia de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión) is a comprehensive text which reﬂects years of research and aca- demic discussion. It aims to implement the constitutional amendments approved by the 2013 telecommunications reform, creating a new convergent law that could jointly regulate broadcasting and telecommunication services. The Citizens’ Bill (Iniciativa Ciudadana de Ley 2013) has a corpus of over 391 articles and represents an attempt to harmonize the new requirements established by the Constitution. The project has already been adopted by a good number of MPs and will soon be discussed in Congress. Two fundamental elements on this Citizen’s Bill are its recognition of broad- casting as a social service, paying particular attention to the rights of audiences, and the reassertion of the state as the sole administrator of the airwaves. In contrast to the current legal framework, this bill does not consider broadcast- ing simply another industry within the capitalist market, but sees it as a vital building block in the construction of citizenship. CONCL USION By the end of the 1970s, the culture of subordination which saw the birth of commercial broadcasting in Mexico was replaced by a culture of collusion, in which media owners and politicians haggle for concessions but work together for their mutual beneﬁt and the protection of a proﬁtable status quo. This period saw an unprecedented concentration of radio and television frequencies in the hands of a few party faithfuls and created the corporations that now monopolize the media market. Paradoxically, the transition to democracy experienced by the country in the last two decades, rather than diversifying the media environment and triggering an era of content plurality, has ushered in a culture of submission in which the entire political class could be blackmailed by the corporations. As Manuel Alejandro Guerrero (2010, 274) has pointed out, after the ousting of the PRI, radio and television stations “gained an enormous amount of symbolic power, facing a fragmented political class with an enor- mous need for airtime.” The approval of the 2013 telecommunications reform hints at a shift in the balance of power and, for the ﬁrst time, it has introduced a new element in the process of media policy-making: an organized and capable civil society. The amendments to the Constitution approved by Congress still need to be imple- mented by secondary legislation and there is a real danger of a counter-reform promoted by the media lobby (Corral Jurado 2014). The winds have nonethe- less changed. The growing public awareness of the role played by the media in the democratic life of the country will make diﬃcult readopting cultures of subordination, collusion or submission, which have for so long characterized the relationship between politicians and media owners in Mexico. The strate- gies employed by AMEDI, from their commitment to advocacy to their strate- gic use of litigation, have ensured that media power is no longer unaccountable in the country.","completion":"# PART THREE: The Power of the Media Reform Movement # CHAPTER TEN: A Perfect Storm for Media Reform: Telecommunications Reforms in Mexico By Alejandro Abraham-Hamanoiel, Goldsmiths, University of London, United Kingdom MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY The Mexican Association for the Right to Information (AMEDI) has been advocating for democratization of media in Mexico for over a decade, employing strategies that include advocacy, monitoring, strategic litigation, and research and policy-making. This relentless campaign has contributed significantly to the telecommunications reform of 2013, leading to changes in how radio and television are regulated and opening up a monopolized market for potential growth in national public broadcasting services. THE SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXT BEHIND MEDIA REFORM Historically, Mexican media was shaped by a relationship of clientelism between media conglomerates and the government. The media landscape was heavily influenced by a few wealthy families with close political ties, guaranteeing loyalty over regulatory interests. However, the recent sociopolitical landscape, influenced by AMEDI's efforts and student movements, along with the return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to power, created a conducive environment for significant reforms. THE CONNECTIVE LOGIC OF #YOSOY132 The #YoSoy132 student movement played an integral role in mobilizing support for media reform. Sparked by a political snub at a private university, the movement amplified through social media, becoming a voice for media democratization. They underscored television networks as significant political entities and called for a change in the traditional media's overwhelming influence on democracy. THE RETURN OF THE PRI The return of the PRI to the presidency, somewhat paradoxically, aligned with the aims of media reform. President Enrique Peña Nieto, despite his well-known ties with Televisa, was a driving force behind the 2013 telecommunications reform. This push for reform may have been an attempt to renew the PRI's image and uphold its legitimacy. THE MEXICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION AMEDI has consistently challenged the status quo regarding media policy and regulation. By bringing together diverse voices, including politicians, academics, and activists, AMEDI has created a platform to advocate for media plurality, challenging the collusion between media companies and the political class that had prevailed for years. SOME AMEDI STRATEGIES AMEDI's commitment to advocacy, oversight of lawmakers and civil servants, strategic litigation, and research have been pivotal in its success. These strategies not only facilitated change in the telecom law but also kept citizens informed. AMEDI's strategies demonstrate the necessity of an active, informed, and strategic civil society in influencing government and media relationships. CONCLUSION The reforms in Mexican telecommunications are a testament to the power of consistent and organized civil advocacy, particularly by AMEDI. While challenges remain—such as the possible counter-reforms by media corporations—the 2013 telecommunications reform represents a critical shift towards accountability and greater civic influence in media regulation that may reshape the future of Mexican democracy."},{"prompt":"فصل بعدی : CHAPTER ELEVEN Between Philosophy and Action The Story of the Media Reform Coalition BENEDET TA BR E v INI , University of Sydney, Australia j USTIN SCHL OSBER G , Birkbeck, University of London, United Kingdom MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY Media reform strategy needs to straddle the intersection of engagement and resis- tance and to negotiate the myriad trade-oﬀs that confront media reform groups. For example, there is a need to strike a balance between devising solutions and develop- ing ideas, and between building consensus and protecting core principles. Above all, we advocate engagement with hegemonic media and policy-making institutions as public platforms, but resistance to the terms and deﬁnitions of policy problems imposed by media and political elites, and to the “logic” of dominant media narra- tives that serve to reinforce communication power. This approach recognizes that even amidst unprecedented, critical junctures in media policy, the political and media establishment is unlikely to reform itself in a substantive, meaningful, or long-lasting way. But critical junctures can oﬀer unparalleled opportunities for media activists and reformers to get their messages out, particularly on occasions when the mainstream media are compelled to cover issues ordinarily shunned from the agenda. Equally, however, we should not lose sight of the reality that hegemonic institutions can distort public debate and they should not be relied upon exclusively as vehicles of outreach. Ultimately, we believe that media reform groups must embrace media activism while avoiding totalizing perspectives that see any kind of engagement with hegemonic institutions as intrinsically counter-productive. The notion of critical junctures has been used by sociologists to explain the windows of opportunities for social change oﬀered at speciﬁc times in his- tory. In the United Kingdom, Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into the ethics and practices of the press announced in 2011 was certainly represented as an important juncture that media reform groups sought to capitalize on. The phone hacking scandal made the news media themselves a headline story to a degree unparalleled in recent times, and the inquiry—as well as subsequent criminal trials—promised to sustain the spotlight. This engendered unique opportunities as well as challenges for media reform movements that we will reﬂect on in this chapter. We will use the Media Reform Coalition (MRC) in the United Kingdom as a case study to elucidate the discursive struggles that tend to foreshadow media activism. Indeed, it is within the sphere of media policy-making that the actions of the MRC were concentrated and where its successes and failures to date can be duly (if some- what preemptively) assessed. First, we will summarize the brief history of the MRC’s formation, actions and challenges. Second, we will theoretically problematize and deﬁne the domain of media policy-making in which the MRC had to operate. Third, we will conceptualize the struggle of the MRC beyond traditional framings of media reforms (Napoli 2007) by linking them to wider battles for social justice and social inclusion. Contemporaneous to events reﬂected on here, the Occupy movement was critiqued for eschewing engagement with existing political institutions and structures, and evading concrete policy solutions to the prob- lem of concentrated wealth (Roberts 2012). In respect of concentrated media power, there has been no such lack of engagement or deﬁned proposals for change on the part of media reform groups. But media activism in the United Kingdom and elsewhere has suﬀered from a lack of congruence in ideas and the kind of grassroots identity of resistance that enabled the Occupy movement to make a meaningful challenge to dominant discursive frameworks around inequality (Juris and Razsa 2012). Ultimately, we argue that strategies of engagement and resistance should not be seen as mutually exclusive in media reform movements; that there is a par- ticular need to reclaim the notion of resistance in the context of concentrated media power from its cooption by neoliberal discourse around press freedom; and that critical media scholars, journalists, and activists have an integral role to play in documenting media failure and imbalances in the coverage of social justice issues at large, as a vehicle for wider social movement integration. FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE MR C The MRC was founded by media academics at Goldsmiths, University of London during summer 2011. Organizational goals were ﬁxed around the concept of a coordinating committee intended to mobilize and build consen- sus among civil society groups, academics, and activists in the context of the phone-hacking crisis. From the outset, the focus was on policy engagement and coordinating civil society responses to the myriad public inquiries that were set to follow. These founding goals endowed the MRC with certain unique characteristics as a reform organization from the outset. First, it began from a set of broad principles rather than its own explicit manifesto for change or policy reform proposals. Media reform advocacy groups were already well-established in the United King- dom, including the Media Standards Trust, Media Wise, the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom, and the more recently formed Hacked Oﬀ (backed by and representing the victims of phone hacking). There seemed little point in adding another voice to this mix. Rather, the vision from the outset was to engender some semblance of an alliance that could overcome the fractures that media policy issues provoke within progres- sive politics. For instance, as has been demonstrated in the North American context (Hackett and Carroll 2006b), media activism in the United Kingdom is typically split between a focus on engagement with hegemonic institutions (seeking to inﬂuence the practices and output of professional media groups and advocating for reform at the policy level) and an oppositional resistance toward them (fostering independent “third sector” media and developing audi- ence frameworks for mainstream media criticism). In regards to the Leveson Inquiry, the latter position was articulated strongly by investigative journalist and radical media critic John Pilger (2012) who regarded it from the outset as a show trial ultimately directed toward “the pres- ervation of the system.” Such comments were typical of critiques emanating from the radical Left and implied that engagement would merely confer legiti- macy on a process that was structurally rigged in favor of established media interests. But this view was countered by Des Freedman, among others, who argued that to dismiss the signiﬁcance of the hearings all together was to ignore “the possibility that the exposure of media power during the course of the Inquiry might help to radicalise victims’ groups and other media reform campaigners.” This, in turn, could lay the basis “for a more sustained challenge to the hege- mony of corporate media” (Freedman 2014, 66–67). This latter position, adopted by MRC from the outset, was not based on a naïve faith in the eﬃcacy of the process. It was based rather on a conviction that Leveson marked a rupture in the dominant discourses that have long served to legitimize the status quo of media policy and regulatory frameworks. As such, the hearings presented two unique opportunities for media reform activism in the United Kingdom. First, they provided unprecedented levels of disclosure in regards to the mechanics of media power which could fuel reform campaigns and activist research in a wide range of contexts. Second, they oﬀered a platform for the expression of alternative—even radical—views about the ownership, structure and regulation of the press which, however marginal- ized from the coverage of Leveson itself, oﬀered a rare opportunity for such views to be heard outside the usual conﬁnes of media activist circles. No matter how ﬂeeting and ephemeral, the MRC’s founding philosophy was based on a perceived need to exploit such opportunity, ultimately in a bid to help energize and sustain media reform activism in Britain. In a tone remi- niscent of Chomsky’s (1967) thesis on the “responsibility of intellectuals,” Freedman (2014, 67) argued that “the left has a responsibility in this context to amplify these arguments about the ﬂaws of an entrenched media power as part of a broader argument about the operation of the capitalist state.” But there was another aspect to Pilger’s critique which did share common ground with the intellectual foundations of the MRC. This was the view that Leveson’s focus on the ethics and practices of the press did not come close to capturing the scope of structural problems impacting on media performance. Though the MRC’s position was not to dismiss the signiﬁcance of press regula- tory reform and the demands of phone-hacking victims, it did share with more radical critiques a conviction that these were insuﬃcient conditions for mean- ingful change. In particular, so long as media ownership issues were consigned to the margins, Leveson would fall prey to the relatively narrow terms of debate set by the mainstream press. Even within this framework, gaps and omissions skewed the press coverage in ways that undermined the voice of victims. But they also lent further weight to demands for more root-and-branch reform that extended beyond the complaints handling system of the press (Bennett and Townend 2012). This holistic approach was reﬂected in the MRC’s initial three working groups covering media ethics, plurality, and funding. Although the latter two were subsequently merged, the output of the working groups reﬂected an on- going focus on plurality and ownership issues as fundamental rather than tan- gential to the campaign. NECESSARY TENSIONS With a strong emphasis on inclusivity, it was inevitable that tensions in the campaign would emerge. They surfaced most acutely in the areas of policy deliberation, campaign strategies and internal governance. With regards to the ﬁrst, the MRC had to negotiate political and ideological fault lines extend- ing beyond that between engagement and resistance outlined above. In the UK context, media reform activism has long been structured around positions that either endorse public service media as an engine of the public sphere and counter-weight to concentrated private media power (Curran 2002; Garnham 1986; Scannell 1989) or perceive all corporate media (both public and private) as inherent threats to the independent performance of journalism (Keane 1991). From the beginning then, the MRC straddled the intersect of conﬂicting realms of discourse even within “friendly” stables. But this was not so much a weakness as its raison d’etre: consensus building was perceived as an essential component of its strategy to exploit the apparent gap that had been opened in the media policy paradigm. A united front seemed the only way to at least oﬀer a challenge to the dominant narratives of the press, which were rapidly closing ranks around a position of cosmetic rather than substantive reform. Early casualties highlighted the diﬃculties of this task. The Voice of the Listener and Viewer, an advocacy group representing the consumer and citizen interest in public broadcasting, pulled out at the ﬁrst hurdle citing concerns that initial policy proposals were not suﬃciently explicit in regards to protect- ing the scope and funding of the BBC. At the other end of the scale, attempts to engage with press freedom groups bore little fruit given their resistance to any suggestion of state involvement in the regulation of the press. Part of the challenge was an intellectual one. In order to engage key stake- holders such as the National Union of Journalists and Hacked Oﬀ, the MRC had to ﬁnd a way to speak in support of both journalists and the victims of phone hacking. Indeed, such a holistic voice seemed to be precisely what was missing from the media reform landscape at large. This further sharpened the focus on media owners as the ultimate bearers of responsibility not only for ethical misconduct in their newsrooms, but also the erosion of journalist autonomy that was a crucial (although less talked about) backdrop to the scandal. Engagement with stakeholders also gave rise to tensions in governance. On the one hand, an initial steering committee had to be all but abandoned due to a failure to sustain the active involvement of group representatives in the pro- duction of collaborative evidence. On the other hand, individuals who did maintain a close involvement expressed concern over what was perceived as a retreat from collaboration by the MRC’s Goldsmiths-based organizers. Tensions derived in part from the MRC’s founding ambition to play a coor- dinating role among existing civil society groups rather than create an academic think tank. But those groups had distinct priorities, agendas and ways of operating ranging from grassroots member-driven organizations like Avaaz to issue-speciﬁc advocacy groups like Hacked Oﬀ. As such, each group was understandably conscious of the need to ensure that its own voice was heard above the pulpit and that eﬀective representation of its constituents was not diluted by allegiance to a somewhat abstracted coalition. In this regard, any media reform alliance faces a much steeper challenge in outreach compared to single-issue campaigns such as the Stop the War Coalition. Underlying all of this was the question of representation, which became explicit by the time the MRC founding principles had developed into concrete proposals for reform. Although very much the product of collaborative research and deliberation, the proposals inevitably gave the MRC a distinct organiza- tional identity that in some ways conﬂicted with its founding principles. Clearly, there would have been little sense in simply collating and representing the views and perspectives of various civil society groups. A core rationale behind the very notion of a coordinating committee was not just to identify common ground among reform groups, but to push for deliberation on a host of emergent issues around which many groups had yet to adopt a deﬁnitive position. Contentious questions regarding the framework of media regulatory reform included whether membership of a new press complaints group should be mandatory or voluntary; whether a comprehensive system of ﬁxed media ownership limits should be imposed within key news markets; and how new sources of public funding for the media should be sourced and allocated. Strik- ing the right balance between advocating concrete proposals for reform while leaving room for consensus building proved to be a key strategic challenge. Strategic challenges were also related to practical considerations of how best to prioritize and allocate the organization’s minimal resources. On the one hand, public engagement as well as media strategies seemed to be an essential compo- nent of any broad-based coalition for reform. But MRC organizers lacked the funds and network building blocks to make signiﬁcant in-roads into the public consciousness on their own accord. Added to this was a virtual impasse in regards to achieving even neutral press coverage. In this respect, it is signiﬁcant that MRC’s most high proﬁle event to date, a celebrity-fronted public rally in May 2012, received virtually no contemporane- ous press coverage. Yet nearly a year later, the event was described in detail by Andrew Gilligan in a piece for the Daily Telegraph in which he attempted to portray Leveson’s modest recommendations for press regulatory reform as the outcome of a left-wing conspiracy. Somewhat ironically, the fact that the MRC “received virtually no publicity in the mainstream media” was used to invoke this sense of conspiracy (Gilligan 2013). DEMANDING THE IMPOSSIBLE By the fourth module of the Leveson hearings (addressing policy solutions), deliberation had given way to advocacy as the central thrust of the MRC’s work, though a strong instinct for collaboration and consensus building con- tinued to drive the organization’s advocacy eﬀorts. It was at this point that a fully mobilized mainstream press began a relentless eﬀort to discredit civil society reform proposals. But in spite of this, the MRC and its partner organizations succeeded in reframing policy debates and the Leveson recommendations—at least in respect of the press complaints system— bore the hallmarks of a civil society as well as subsequent cross-party consensus. For a brief moment, what had eluded all of Leveson’s long line of predecessors began to look like a realistic possibility: a system of self-regulation of the press with broad representation, statutory underpinning, in-built protections for journalist autonomy, and meaningful powers of sanction and enforcement (Leveson 2012). Although the press lobby succeeded in deterring Parliament from legislating, the Hacked Oﬀ lobby managed to pull oﬀ a cross-party deal on a royal charter that embodied the bulk of Leveson’s recommendations. What’s more, the royal charter was to be uniquely entrenched to the extent that ministers would be unable to alter it without Parliamentary approval, eﬀectively giving it the same status as legal statute. A rival charter proposal backed by a majority of the press endorsed ministe- rial discretion over parliamentary oversight. This seemed to lay bare the hollow rhetoric of libertarian deﬁance that had dominated the opinion editorial pages for months. In any case, the cross-party charter won out and was approved by the Privy Council in the autumn of 2013. Perhaps in an attempt to hedge his bets, Leveson opted not to address the ownership and plurality question in a substantive way, despite the inquiry’s unprecedented disclosures of excessive intimacy and institutional corruption between media and political elites. But buoyed by the success of the cross-party agreement, the Labour party front bench began to pick up and run with owner- ship reform proposals. Shadow culture secretary and deputy Labour leader Har- riet Harman spoke of ownership concentration as having fostered “a culture of invincibility” among dominant media and that “it’s wrong for democracy for there to be a lack of plurality in newspapers.” But red lines on reform began to be drawn almost as soon as the prospect of real change glimmered on the horizon. For a political establishment still gripped in the discursive throes of austerity, funding solutions were a policy nonstarter. And in a matter of months, the gap had narrowed further as caps rapidly became a dirty word and even discussion of ownership became all but displaced by the less eﬀacing issue of plurality. At the same time, the royal charter began to look like a hollow victory as newspapers collectively opted out and pressed ahead with their own plans for a new complaints-handling body. By the close of 2013, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) had emerged as the favorite to replace the discredited Press Complaints Commission. Newspapers seemed content with the threat of exemplary damages if complaints could not be resolved by IPSO, which would not be recognized under the terms of the royal charter. Within a matter of months then, what had looked like unprecedented achievement by media reform groups appeared to unravel into something more like spectacular failure. But it is perhaps too early to draw meaningful lessons. Much of the historical impetus for the MRC derives from the Channel 4 legacy: it took the best part of three decades to reach a political compromise over Britain’s third public broadcaster in 1982. But it nevertheless resulted in a com- paratively radical mandate to represent minority interests and to cover political issues in-depth without impartiality constraints within particular programs (Curran and Seaton 2009). The battle over Channel 4, however, was not equivalent to the struggle for a democratic and accountable media system and the fundamental reform that would entail. In this context, the word reform seems inappropriately modest when matched against an end-goal that demands a root-and-branch overhaul of media policy and regulatory frameworks. UNDERSTANDING MEDIA POLICY MAKING AS ORDER OF DISCOURSE Because the MRC had to function and operate predominantly within the domain of policy-making (given inadequate resources to support substantive public engagement campaigns), it is useful to ponder over the meaning of policy and its relevance for the struggle of media reforms. The literature tends to understand policy and policy making in diﬀerent ways (Colebatch 2002; Ham and Hill 1993). For some, policy is “what govern- ments do, why they do it, and what diﬀerence it makes” (Dye 1976, 1). How- ever, governments are not the only bodies that produce policy, and there are also policies developed by independent regulatory bodies, public institutions, and trade organizations (Galperin 2004). A common model applied to the study of policy is the “cycle model” (Colebatch 2002, 55) that sees policy- making as a sequence of stages: “agenda setting (problem recognition), policy formulation (proposal of a solution), decision-making (choice of a solution), policy implementation (delivery), and policy evaluation (checking the results)” (Howlett and Ramesh 2003, 10). Of course, in reality, the policy-making process is more convoluted than the cycle model assumes. Stages may not follow the predicted order or may be omitted. A particularly fruitful line of thought aimed at analyzing policy-making and which has attracted considerable attention in the study of media reforms (Napoli 2007) has been the “interest group approach to policy” that explains policy as “the outcome of competing powerful interest groups” preferences that can span from NGOs to trade union organizations to business organizations and so on. As Galperin (2004, 160) explains: “Policy outcomes are typically explicated by the organization and the resources available to interest groups and their support coalitions. In other words, policy outcomes are a function of the power that each interest group is able to amass and wield in support of its pre- ferred outcome.” However, this conﬁguration shares with the cycle model approach a ten- dency to overlook the complexities built into the policy-making process and neglects an analysis of social and cultural power at play. Policy outcome becomes the result of a predictable war between competing groups with diﬀer- ent goals, thus ignoring that “much political activity is concerned with main- taining the status quo and resisting challenges to the existing allocation of values” (Ham and Hill 1993, 12). For this reason, the work of Michel Foucault on governmentality and dis- course (1981 [1970], 1991) might facilitate a better understanding of the realm of policy-making and provide fruitful observations for activists seeking to build strong and successful reform movements. Foucault’s work on governmentality draws on the belief that “the how of power is as important as who has the power” (1991, 103). Foucault’s study on the production of discourse is also par- ticularly useful in that it problematizes the practices of government and how public policy is developed, shaped, and changed. According to this thesis, rela- tions of power “permeate, characterise and constitute the social body, and these relations of power cannot themselves be established, consolidated nor imple- mented without the production, accumulation, circulation and functioning of a discourse” (1980, 93). In “The Order of Discourse” (1981 [1970]), Foucault investigates the social practices of disciplines and shows how discourses are embedded in social prac- tices (and disciplines) through rituals, values, and routines. Foucault’s ideas are extremely valuable in an analysis of policy-making, because they challenge the belief that media policy is a rational process. On the contrary, Foucault warns that the rules of government are not themselves deﬁned by the rule of law, but rather by the rules of knowledge, power, and discourse formation. So what is presented to us as incontrovertible truth or evidence in policy-making is rather the product of “the will to truth”: “Thus all that appears to our eyes is a truth conceived as a richness, a fecundity, a gentle and insidiously universal force, and in contrast we are unaware of the will to truth, that prodigious machinery designed to exclude” (ibid., 56). Drawing on Foucault, the work of Norman Fairclough (1989) is extremely helpful in highlighting the strategic importance of an “order of discourse” that embodies speciﬁc ideologies in policy: “Since discourse is the favored vehicle of ideology, and therefore of control by consent, it may be that we should expect a quantitative change in the role of discourse in achieving social control” (ibid., 37). Thus, policy becomes not the product of policy-making institutions but rather an order of discourse structuring what can and cannot be said as well as who has the power to speak. But as Gramsci (1996) has argued, social control in modern complex societies is not exerted through coercion but through con- sent, therefore the ideologies conveyed through discourse are not imposed, but simply accepted. Drawing on this approach, the order of discourse that the coalition had to challenge becomes apparent: on the one hand, the hegemonic mantra of mar- ket liberalism, on the other hand, the cultural background of an established commercial media system. For example, a dominant discourse of market liberals’ policy-makers might interpret media democratization as deregulation (Hackett and Carroll 2006a), while a change of media systems might seem unthinkable because it becomes detrimental to a freedom of speech argument, especially in the United States where it is often evoked as the principle upholding liberal individualism. This can explain, for example, why in policy discourse in (and beyond) the United Kingdom, there is a common belief that regulation of media ownership should not be a priority for policy-makers but rather that plurality as an instru- ment of market competition should be the main concern. Indeed, plurality is becoming an increasingly popular term of reference for policy-makers develop- ing reforms in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia. FR OM MEDIA REFORMS TO SOCIAL JUSTICE So how then can a dominant policy discourse be transformed by a media activist campaign and an order of discourse be subverted? What are the tools? And what is then the role of activist groups? For years, as Napoli (2007, 21) rightly argues, early work on media reform lacked a solid theoretical perspective, while the focus seemed to be consistently “legalistic.” When later studies embraced diﬀerent frameworks, they seemed to adhere to interest group theories of policy-making discussed above. More recently however, scholarship has found more fruitful ground through conceptualizing the battles of groups advocating media reforms as the actions of an emerging social movement (Atton 2003; Calabrese 2004; Hackett and Carroll 2006a). Hackett and Carroll (2006a) elaborated a thorough sketch of the most important frames employed by scholarship to understand media reform move- ments. Out of the main frames, perhaps one of the less developed is the idea of media reform as “a ﬁrst issue that can draw new people into public life, citizen activism, and wider struggles for social justice” (Jansen 2011, 7). Indeed, accord- ing to McChesney (2007, 220), “fates of media reform and social justice research are intertwined. They will rise or fall together.” Jensen (2011, 2) also notes that Amartya Sen’s (2009) theory of justice dovetails with McChesney’s perspective, as “the removal of barriers to free and open discussion, the devel- opment of the right (‘capability’) to communicate, and the institutionalization of an ‘unrestrained and healthy media’ (to give ‘voice to the neglected and dis- advantaged’)” becomes fundamental “to the pursuit of human justice and security.” According to Mouﬀe (1999, 756), “every consensus exists as a temporary result of a provisional hegemony, as a stabilization of power and that always entails some form of exclusion.” If hegemony is provisional, then media reform movements should concentrate on building a permanent campaign far beyond a single-issue crusade. Given that it took thirty years to introduce and develop a successful policy discourse to launch Britain’s third public broadcaster, Channel 4, in 1982, a more overreaching media reform campaign would need to create a wider base, a consistent message, and a long-term agenda. If we consider that the key challenge for any media reform movement lies not so much in building consensus among existing stakeholders, but in articu- lating a narrative that can resonate with wider struggles for social justice, then the MRC experience oﬀers some useful lessons. First, it seems clear that the organization was somewhat constrained by a degree of unavoidable short- termism in its outlook and approach. To understand why this was the case, we need to recall the peculiar circumstances and political context into which it was born. It was the prospect of a public inquiry into the media with a remit unprecedented in scope which provided the impetus for the founding of the MRC in 2011. It was also the basis on which it secured limited short-term funding from the Open Society Foundations with the explicit objective of coordinating civil society responses to the inquiry. Along with these speciﬁci- ties enshrined in the MRC’s founding agenda and funding terms, the scope for action was further constrained by the imminent time pressures imposed by the various deadlines for submission of evidence to the Leveson and concomitant inquiries. This also contributed to situating the MRC ﬁrmly within the policymaking community. It was a position that was further anchored by the MRC’s collabo- ration with Hacked Oﬀ, an organization with an explicit lobbying focus. As we have seen, this provided the MRC, for a brief moment at least, with an oppor- tunity to intervene and to some extent reframe media policy debates. But it also constrained the organization to the extent that the press had an incompa- rably more fundamental role in deﬁning and circumscribing the terms of that debate. Thus the notion of press freedom was always exclusively tied to the threat of statutory underpinning of press regulation. Media reform groups were forced to articulate defenses on the basis that statutory underpinning would not threaten press freedom, with little room to demonstrate the real threat to press freedom posed by ownership. Maintaining such a close proximity to the heart of the policymaking com- munity also limited the MRC’s capacity to reach out to groups that were not already engaged in media policy debates but might nevertheless align with a progressive agenda for media reform. As already mentioned, the MRC was constrained in this respect also by its limited resources. But one resource in plentiful supply was its capacity to present new evidence of media failure through critical scholarship, new studies and new data. By tying this critical scholarship directly to the concerns of other social justice movements, media reform groups can provide a basis for wider engagement and thus a more assured footing in their resistance to dominant neoliberal discursive frameworks. As Hackett and Carroll (2004, 18) succinctly observe: “This frame repositions the project as one of social justice in a world organized around global capitalism, racism and patriarchy, and directly connotes the need for alliances, even integra- tion, with other social movements.” Of course, this is not a new idea. There are plenty of historical precedents demonstrating success in linking media reform with other social movements. For example, Horwitz (1997, 344) explains that the success of US media reforms movements of the 1970s was due to a “connection to the broader social move- ment of Civil Rights.” The key challenge is to think of how to build these connections in the contemporary socio-political landscape and how best to link media reform movements to campaigns such as climate change activism, with a view to making fair, accountable and accurate coverage of climate change issues a key concern of campaigning groups. This would in turn draw meaningful support for media reform from a wider layer of other groups. We could perhaps also draw lessons from the way in which climate change activism has evolved into a movement for climate justice, encompassing a network of organizations committed to social, gender as well as ecological iniquities. CONCL USION A stronger discursive focus on resistance might also make it easier for media activist and advocacy movements to engage a broader spectrum of groups already active in their struggles against poverty, racial and gender discrimina- tion, ecological risks, and violations of human rights; to foster and build soli- darity across diﬀerent social justice movements in an eﬀort to change and reshape dominant media policy discourses. Most importantly, a focus on resistance poses a direct challenge to the dominant discursive order that deﬁnes resistance exclusively in the context of the threat of state interference and the struggle to safeguard press freedom (or more accurately, press power). Such a focus need not necessitate disengagement from the media policy process or from established stakeholders, provided that the target of resistance is framed clearly and exclusively as media owners who use their assets in a bid to control the political and public agenda. Such a platform could even be used to further engage with professional journalists themselves with a view to redressing the balance of power between capital and labor within newsrooms (Sparks 2007). Resistance to corporate media ownership also provides a basis upon which to articulate a struggle that transcends the boundaries between diﬀerent national contexts. On one level, creeping state control of the media in, for example, Hungary over recent years looks a world apart from the UK context. But at root in both cases is a strengthening alliance between media and political elites. Whether that alliance is founded on favored media outlets or compliant political actors merely reﬂects two faces of the same problem: the reassertion of control over public conversations. Ultimately, the split that Carroll and Hackett (2006b) identiﬁed between media activist groups that focus on engagement with hegemonic institutions and those that adopt an oppositional resistance toward them need not reﬂect a choice that has to—or indeed should be—made. Though it may take some time, media activist groups that are embedded in broad-based and grassroots movements for social change stand a better chance of mounting a meaningful challenge to the dominant neoliberal frameworks that overarch media policy debates. Those frameworks co-opt notions of resistance and autonomy in ways that obscure the real and fundamental threat to press freedom in the United Kingdom and other Western democracies: concentrated media power.","completion":"# CHAPTER ELEVEN: Between Philosophy and Action: The Story of the Media Reform Coalition By Benedetta Brevini, University of Sydney, Australia & Justin Schlosberg, Birkbeck, University of London, United Kingdom MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY The Media Reform Coalition (MRC) in the United Kingdom operates on the intersection of engagement with hegemonic media and resistance against the narratives imposed by media and political elites. The MRC encourages taking advantage of critical junctures, like the Leveson Inquiry, to promote media reform messages but acknowledges that hegemonic institutions can distort public debate. FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE MRC Formed during the UK's phone-hacking crisis in 2011, the MRC aimed to build consensus among civil society groups, academics, and activists. Instead of presenting its own manifesto, it focused on policy engagement and supporting civil society responses to media inquiries, while not avoiding actions that could be perceived as radical or fundamental. NECESSARY TENSIONS The MRC had to navigate tensions within its ranks, dealing with different perspectives on media reform, from those advocating for public service media to radical voices that distrust all corporate media. Balancing concrete proposals and broad consensus while allocating limited resources proved to be strategically challenging, and gaining press coverage was difficult. DEMANDING THE IMPOSSIBLE Despite limited resources and short-term funding, the MRC managed to influence public inquiry discussions and the framing of media policy debates. The cross-party royal charter, an outcome of the Leveson Inquiry, was considered a victory for media reform but faced the challenge of being adopted by the press industry. UNDERSTANDING MEDIA POLICY-MAKING AS ORDER OF DISCOURSE Media policy is often governed by discourse and ideology rather than transparent legal frameworks. Neoliberal discourses emphasizing market liberalism and press freedom often overshadow the need for media democratization and ownership regulation. FROM MEDIA REFORMS TO SOCIAL JUSTICE Media reform should be integrated into broader social justice movements. Like the climate change activism that evolved into a movement for climate justice, media reform can benefit from solidarity with groups fighting against various social iniquities. CONCLUSION Effective media reform necessitates both engagement with and resistance against concentrated media power. Joining forces with diverse social justice movements may help reframe the resistance against media policy controlled by media moguls and political elites. A focus on concentrated media ownership can unite efforts nationally and internationally, ultimately confronting dominant neoliberal policies that impede genuine press freedom."},{"prompt":"از این به بعد کنار عناوین دیگه # نذار . بریم سراغ فصل بعدی: CHAPTER TWELVE Media Reform Movements in Taiwan HSIN - YI SANDY T SAI , National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan SHIH - HUNG L O , National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY This chapter discusses how media reform groups in Taiwan and the Media Watch Foundation and the Campaign for Media Reform in particular worked together to engage in media reform movements ranging from the promotion of public media to the campaign against big media mergers. The strategies they utilized are context-sensitive and mostly eﬀective in terms of raising public awareness, setting public agendas and having an impact upon government decisions and policies concerning media freedom and media democratization. These strategies include, among others, engaging in public debates, lobbying the legislature, and, where necessary, mobilizing public support in both online and oﬄine protests. However, these strategies have limitations too. Most of all, the mainstream media were usu- ally hostile to media reform movements and the government was passive in its response to the cause of media reform. To overcome this extremely diﬃcult situa- tion, media activists in Taiwan have taken advantage of new media and social media to pursue their media reform goals and have increasingly engaged in creat- ing more diverse information alternatives to the mainstream media. In recent years, Taiwan has been ranked as one of the top countries in terms of press freedom in Asia (Freedom House 2014). This is remarkable given that the country was still ruled by an authoritarian, one-party regime less than three decades ago. Until 1987, the martial law, which aimed to suppress the Com- munists in mainland China, was ﬁnally lifted and the press liberalized (AP 153 1987). Taiwanese citizens were allowed to form diﬀerent political parties. The political transition of democratization in the late 1980s put an end to the world’s longest period of rule under martial law (thirty-eight consecutive years) and the longstanding bans on organizing political parties and publishing new newspapers. From then onward, three waves of media reform movements aimed at media democratization started apace. Each wave of media reform pursued the same goals but utilized somewhat diﬀerent strategies. Over the last few decades, the interests of the ruling party usually com- manded civil society; the party opinions and interests usurped the public ones. Therefore, the ﬁrst wave of media reform movements in Taiwan called for media privatization and liberalization because the government maintained its monopoly over terrestrial television right up to 1997, when the ﬁrst privately owned terrestrial television station was launched in Taiwan. Yet, another eight years would pass before the government was forced to ﬁnally give up its owner- ship of the other three terrestrial television stations. However, the media privatization and liberalization that ran riot in the 1990s also caused new problems. Private media in pursuit of commercial interests could not manage the responsibility of handling the public service and the public sphere. The big media consolidation, thanks to a series of mergers, had resulted in “market-driven journalism” (McManus 1994) or even “audience ratings journalism” (Lin 2009). The second wave of move- ments for media reform in Taiwan thus strived to campaign against big media and irresponsible journalism prevailed in the market. Since the late 1990s, established by nonpartisan media activists, the Media Watch Foundation has done a great deal to promote media literacy education and ﬁght media com- mercialism. The third wave of media reform movements has entered new terrain. Since 2003, media activists and media scholars have formed the Campaign for Media Reform with the intent to pursue new goals. This new movement seeks to expand public media that correspond more closely to the ideal of public service broadcasting in terms of quality, universality, independence, and diversity and strengthen alternative, independent citizen media. In this chapter, we focus on how media reform groups in Taiwan engaged in the aforementioned media reform movements and the strategies utilized by these groups. We begin by providing a brief account of media history and the changing media landscape in Taiwan. Next, we discuss the media reform movements in Taiwan and the strategies media reform activists utilized respec- tively in the campaign for the expansion of public media and the campaign against big media mergers. We also examine the increasing relevance of the alternative, independent citizen media in Taiwan’s media reform movements. Our discussion concludes with the future prospects for media reform move- ments in Taiwan. THE CHANGING MEDIA L ANDSCAP E IN TAIWAN Taiwan is a small island country with a population of twenty-three million. Before 1987, because of the martial law, the broadcast media in Taiwan were mainly owned and controlled by the ruling Nationalist Party, the government, and the military. Most of the newspapers were in the hands of those who were close and loyal to the authoritarian regime. With the abolition of the martial law, the ban on publishing new newspa- pers was lifted and newspapers were liberalized. In 1993, cable systems were legalized. The media industry started to grow rapidly. By 2015, there were 4 main daily newspapers, 171 radio stations, 5 terrestrial broadcasters, 57 cable systems, 5 multiple-system operators (MSOs), and 294 satellite TV channels. About 59.6 percent of households subscribed to cable TV (NCC 2015). However, the huge number of media outlets did not guarantee a free market- place of ideas. The ﬁerce competitive market did not bring quality news to the Taiwanese people. Since 2003, tabloid journalism and sensational news has become inﬂuential in the media industry. Sensational news was commonly seen on TV and in newspapers. With the inﬂuences of media commercialism, profes- sional journalism came to be at risk. The threat of big media consolidation and the inﬂuence of political power still remained severe to media freedom and the freedom of speech in Taiwan. Therefore, the need for media reform became more and more urgent. Since 1987, there have been three main media reform waves in Taiwan. MEDIA REFORM MO VEMENT S IN TAIWAN These three waves of media reform movements can be categorized as: (1) media privatization and liberalization starting in 1987; (2) the campaign for expand- ing public media starting in 2003; and (3) the ﬁght over big media mergers in recent years. m EDIA pRIvATIzATION AND LIBERALIzATION Similar to the United States, the 1980s can also be characterized by many major political and societal changes (Mueller 2004). In 1987, the government abashed the martial law and Taiwan started its ﬁrst step out from authorized govern- ment toward a more democratized country (Ministry of Culture 2011). How- ever, despite the lifting of the martial law, Taiwanese society and media still had a long way to go before it could be considered fully democratic. The ﬁght for freedom speech happened at the same time as many social activists were still ﬁghting for basic democratic rights in Taiwan. For instance, at that time, advocating for an independent Taiwan was still prohibited by the government. Right after the lifting of martial law, many social activists ﬁghting for freedom of speech were organizing protests and strikes. A notable dissident, Nylon Cheng, even sacriﬁced his life in 1989 to ﬁght the erstwhile authoritar- ian state in an attempt to awaken Taiwanese society. In line with ﬁghting for a democratic society and media, the push for media privatization and liberalization led to the ﬁrst wave of media reform in Taiwan. An association formed by scholars and social groups argued for “no political parties, government, or military ownership of the three broadcasters.” A big protest for media privatization and liberalization took place in 1995 in the capital city Taipei despite concerns about the power of big ﬁnancial consolida- tion (Kuang 2004). The protest successfully led to the establishment of a new law regarding the sale of government-owned stocks of the broadcasters in order to privatize and liberalize them. A series of media privatizations and liberalizations occurred in the 1990s. In 1993, cable systems were liberalized, and the government-owned telephone company was privatized in 1996. Between 1993 and 1998, there were limited foreign investments on the media in Taiwan. After the Cable Radio and Televi- sion Act was modiﬁed in 1999, foreign investments increased substantially. Three major MSOs were owned by big global media players after 2007 (Huang 2009). These major changes did not come out of nowhere: Comments made by scholars and social movements on the streets all contributed to the develop- ment of media privatization and liberalization. The experiences learned from other regulators in the world also contributed to the changes. In hindsight, the seemingly inevitable trend of media privatization and liberalization since the 1990s has catered for the interests of foreign private equity while foreign own- ers of the MSOs did not in return invest signiﬁcantly in the production of local content. Instead, the foreign owners of the MSOs were seeking arbitrage prof- its. As a result, the trend of privatization and liberalization since the 1990s exacerbated the already serious lack of quality and diversity in terms of media content available to local audiences. Strategies Utilized According to Mueller (2004), there are three kinds of advocacy modes in infor- mation and communication policies: content, economic, and rights. Content is related to the problems of media messages; economic advocacy is about the supply of communication products and services; rights advocacy concerns individual rights, such as freedom of expression or property rights. At this stage, advocates asserted the rights of communication, including communica- tion rights for public and media workers. Freedom of expression and anticen- sorship rights were the central arguments advanced by social movement activists in Taiwan during the ﬁrst wave of media reforms. Hackett and Carroll (2006) indicate ﬁve action frames for remaking media: Free press, cultural environment, media democratization, the right to com- municate, and media justice. At the time, Taiwanese society was still in the process of ﬁghting for a free press, the right to communicate, and media democratization. Political and social activists conducted protests and estab- lished new alternative magazines. THE CAmpAIGN FOR EXpANDING p UBLIC mEDIA Media liberalization and privatization in the 1990s did not bear fruit in terms of media democratization in the public interest. The mainstream commercial media in pursuit of ratings and advertising revenues at the expense of news credibility gradually lost the public’s trust. It is no surprise that, according to an Edelman Asia-Paciﬁc survey, Taiwanese broadcasters are ranked by viewers as being the least trusted in Asia (Lo 2012a). Many foreign commentators have also observed that the irresponsible journalism prevailing in Taiwan has caused widespread public mistrust (Fuchs 2014; Harding 2010). For example, a writer for Foreign Policy recently criticized that “over the last decade, Taiwanese media have come to be known for in-your-face, no-holds-barred reporting that manages to be simultaneously sensationalist and mundane” (Fuchs 2014). The worsening situation of media performance as a whole in the early 2000s gave impetus to a new movement for media reform in Taiwan. Two major media reform organizations were established: the Campaign for Media Reform and the Media Watch Foundation. The Campaign for Media Reform was established in 2003 by a group of scholars, news workers and social movement activists from the Democratization of Broadcasters Coalition. The campaign goal is to improve media performance and environment, educate the public about media literacy, and improve media policies in Taiwan. Since 2008, it has hosted three annual media reform meetings to invite the public to talk about media reform in Taiwan (Lo 2012b). The campaign has initiated many impor- tant media reform movements and press conferences to make the public aware of pressing social issues. The Media Watch Foundation was established in 2002. The organization’s goal is to protect the labor rights of media workers and to improve media literacy education for the public. The foundation also helped to form a public media mechanism, initiate many media reform movements, and monitor media performance and self-regulation in Taiwan. The foundation provided many training workshops at community colleges to help the public learn about media literacy and citizen journalism and has also supported youth programs in Taiwan. Both organizations have had a great inﬂuence on the major media reform movements in Taiwan over the last decade. The establishment of public media—Public Television Station (PTS) and Taiwan Broadcasting Service (TBS)—is an important achievement for media reform movements in Taiwan. Aimed at serving the public interest and bal- ancing the inadequacy of commercial televisions, PTS started broadcasting in July 1998. Back in 2003, when media reformers and social movement activists fought for separating political power, government, and military inﬂuences from broadcasters, the urge for a public broadcasting system was widely dis- cussed. As a result, TBS was established in July 2006. Since the 1970s, communication scholars had argued the importance of constructing a public television service in Taiwan (Feng 2006). However, the public television conceived in the 1970s and the 1980s was more like a televi- sion that did not have commercials, dealt with programs for social education, and played the role of fulﬁlling government’s need for policies and education. In 1992, eighteen communication scholars at the National Cheng-Chi Univer- sity made a public comment criticizing the draft of the Public Television Act (PTA), focusing in particular on the formation of the board for PTS. In 1993, the Student Group for Observing the Public Television was established. Com- munication scholars collaborated with other scholars (e.g., economists, law- yers, and sociologists) and citizen groups to form a preparation group for the PTS. The movements for establishing a public broadcasting system were initi- ated by the Coalition for Establishing Public Media in 1997. However, on April 16, 1997, the major political party (KMT) announced that Taiwan would be giving up the establishment of public television. Scholars and others who cared about public media made their discontent with the decision known via public newspapers. The Association for the Establishment of Public Media, scholars, and students protested in front of the Legislative Yuan. Because of these com- ments and protests, the KMT decided not to give up on the act. The draft of the Public Television Act was ﬁnally approved by the Legislative Yuan. In 1997, the Democratization of Broadcasters Coalition, which was the pre- decessor of the Campaign for Media Reform (Kuo 2010), was established to plan the formation of a public television system in Taiwan. By 2014, four sta- tions were included in TBS. Moreover, public interest is the main principle for the maintenance of TBS which is owned by the public, instead of the govern- ment. However, the management of TBS is not straightforward. There have been countless arguments and debates concerning the nomination of the board members and the CEO of TBS. The need to have proper legislation rule for TBS is still an ongoing debate in Taiwan and has led t o many protests urging legislative reform. Strategies Utilized Similar to the claims made by advocacy movements in the ﬁrst wave of media reform, this movement also asserted the rights of freedom of speech and com- munication: The right to public television, without interference by the govern- ment and the military during the second wave of media reform. In addition, they also were advocates for better content (Mueller 2004), a need that was not always covered by commercial media. The main strategy used in establishing PTS was to form an agenda against government and military intervention, later forming positive arguments as to how to establish PTS (Feng 2006). Media reform activists tried to emphasize the importance of free broadcasters and a real public television station (not a government-controlled station). The initial argument was proposed by scholars in communication departments and then extended to scholars in other ﬁelds. Trying to persuade the public and the government was critical. However, dur- ing these movements, the intellectuals initiated the discussions. Still, they could not persuade the government to accept the values they proposed (Feng 2006). THE FIGHT OvER BIG m EDIA mERGERS Following the stream of media privatization, the legislative Yuan passed the National Communications Commission Organization Act in 2005. The act calls for the establishment of the National Communications Commission (NCC) to separate the inﬂuence of political parties, government, and military on the mass media. In February 2006, the NCC was established to take charge of media regula- tion and related policy-making on telecommunications and broadcasting industries. Originally, the telecommunications industry was regulated by the Directorate General of Telecommunications and the broadcasting industries were regulated by the Department of Broadcasting Aﬀairs of the Government Information oﬃce. However, with the increase in media convergence, there was a need to have a central regulator to take charge of both telecommunica- tions and broadcasting industries. In the age of media convergence, the issues of media concentration and media monopolies are more complicated and consolidation can be bigger and more inﬂuential. A media company can own multiple newspapers, online media, TV, radio, and cable systems. This makes companies even more power- ful and inﬂuential than if they only owned one media outlet (such as a news- paper), making antimedia monopoly movements even more important. Since 2006, several big mergers have been reviewed by the NCC, including the merger of BCC (radio) and CTV (TV) in 2006; the China Times (one of the four major newspapers) with two major TV news stations (CTV and CtiTV) in 2007; Taiwan Mobile with several cable systems in 2008; as well as Want Want China Broadcast’s proposed buyout of China Network Systems (Lo 2013). Among these cases, the establishment of Want Want China Media Corp. and the approval of its subsequent mergers have been the most debated topics in Taiwan. The Want Want China Times Incidents Want Want Corp., originally a food product company, merged with one of the main newspapers (the China Times) and became a multiplatform media corporation that owned two TV news stations and a newspaper company (Want Want China Times Media Group) in 2009. This incident was called “Want Want merges China Times, CTV and CtiTV,” also know as “Three Chung Incident.” The approval of the merger was accompanied by signiﬁcant debates. Nevertheless, the Want Want merger was approved by the NCC in 2008 and established Want Want China Times Corp in 2009. Owning two news stations and one newspaper did not satisfy the corpora- tion. In 2011, Want Want China Times Media Corp (Want Want) proposed to buy one of the main MSOs (CNS) in Taiwan. This merger (“Wang Chung Incident”) would allow the corporation to own twelve TV channels, eleven cable systems, one publisher, two magazines, three online media companies, four newspaper companies (including one major newspaper), and at least nine other investment companies (such as travel agency and production compa- nies). This would lead to a great monopoly in the media industry in Taiwan. The International Federation of Journalist (IFJ) also pointed out that the merger would allow Want Want to own about one-third of audiences and read- ers in the whole media industry. This caused great concern (Liberty Times 2012). Therefore, a series of media reform movements began to ﬁght this media monopoly. In February 2013, after about two and a half years’ investigation and debates, the NCC did not approve the merger proposal due to the public con- cern over the formation of a media monopoly (and the concentration of a marketplace of ideas). Strategies Utilized The media reform movement used a variety of strategies to achieve its goal including public comments, exposure to media, protests, and allies. The media reform movements against the Want Want merger started with a series of public remarks in traditional newspapers made by communication and journalism scholars in September, 2011. These scholars were also active members of the Campaign for Media Reform in Taiwan which also issued a public statement opposing the merger. After September 2011, a series of letters to newspapers, antimonopoly workshops, and public statements were made by scholars in diﬀerent ﬁelds and other media reform and social groups. For example, in September 2011, a workshop on cross-media concentration was held by the Institute of Journalism at National Taiwan University (NTU). On October 24, 2011, the NCC held the ﬁrst public hearing on the merger of Want Want. At the same time, scholars and media reform groups (including Taiwan Media Watch, Citizen Congress Watch, the Association of Taiwan Journalists, and the Campaign for Media Reform) started an online protest via a campaign platform created by social movement groups (see http://campaign .tw-npo.org/index2.php). By using blogs and other social media, including Facebook and Twitter, more than three thousand groups and individuals signed up to oppose the merger. Another critical strategy to raise public awareness is to make full use of the media (Ryan, Jeﬀreys, and Blozei 2012). In the same month, the NTU and media campaign groups held a press conference to urge the NCC to ﬁght the media monopoly. Later on, while the NCC was hosting the ﬁrst public hear- ing, a group of students and media reform groups rallied in front of the NCC building. These events attracted the attention of the government. As a result, the Legislative Yuan invited one of the scholars to attend their meeting. After that, several workshops were held by these journalism and communication scholars in order to attract more media coverage and the attention of the public and the governments. The public pressure urged the NCC to postpone the approval. On February 6, 2012, sixty-six people signed up with the “No China Times Movement” against the interference of China Times on media freedom. There was also a concern on how Want Want might have unbalanced news reports that favored the Chinese government. On May 7, 2012, the NCC held a sec- ond public hearing on the merger. One thing worth mentioning is that there were diﬀerent points of view at the time. Some scholars opposed the merger, while some argued that it was diﬃcult to have a real media monopoly in Tai- wan because there were plenty of news sites. Other scholars argued that a high standard of the investigation on what stakeholders said was similar to the time when the freedom of speech was highly restricted in Taiwan. In July 2012, the NCC announced a conditional approval of the merger. These conditions focused on maintaining the independence of news stations owned by the corporation, which was one of the emphases of those series of anti–media monopoly movements. After the announcement of conditional approval in September 2012, a protest involving more than nine thousand individuals was organized by the Association of Taiwan Journalists and other social groups. This was one of the biggest protests in Taiwan in the past twenty- two years. In November 2012, Taiwan Law Society, Taipei Society, and Taiwan Democ- racy Watch ﬁled an Amicus curiae brief to urge the NCC to ensure that those three conditions were satisﬁed before approving the merger. In 2013, the corpo- ration did not fulﬁll those conditions; hence the NCC announced its disap- proval of the deal. ASSESSmENT For the ﬁrst wave of media reform movements, activists’ strategies were made based on their previous decisions and the constraints of the environments (Meyer and Staggenborg 2012). In this phase, the majority of the intellectuals were people who fought for the freedom of speech and the freedom of the Tai- wanese people. The mainstream media were controlled and inﬂuenced by the government (the main political party). Hence, having protests and publishing and commenting on alternative news magazines and newspapers were the main strategies used. For the second wave of media reform movements, scholars and media reform activists had tried to gain the awareness of the government and the public for the importance of “no political power, no government inﬂuence on media.” Writing critiques/letters in the mainstream media and conducting protests and strikes were the main strategies they used. For the third wave of media reform movements, the approach to informa- tion and communication policies was more mixed and involved a combination of content, economic, and rights issues. Compared with two other wave move- ments, media activists had more resources (more possible media outlets) and networks (more institutions to form allies). As Fetner and Sanders (2012) point out, building up institutions for social movements is critical to the success of movements. In ﬁghting against media monopolies, all ﬁve actions mentioned in Hackett and Carroll (2006) were utilized. Speciﬁcally, these movements emphasized the speciﬁc cultural environment (the relationship between China and Taiwan) for freedom of speech in Taiwan (to avoid inﬂuence by the political power of China). Fighting for media justice (for people who were sued by the China Times for criticizing the newspaper) was another action taken. Participating in multiple actions and using multiple networks were critical strategies in the movement’s success. THE RELE VANCE OF ALTERNATIVE AND CITIZEN MEDIA Media reformers in Taiwan also engaged in the expansion of independent and citizen media. For example, they launched several websites with the purpose of empowering citizen journalists. Among these websites, civilmedia.tw and we- report.org are the most active in producing citizen videos and crowdfunded independent investigative journalism. Both websites were established and managed by media reformers who are also the key ﬁgures of the Campaign for Media Reform in Taiwan as well as the Media Watch Foundation. Civilmedia.tw is an alternative, independent media website in Taiwan (see www.civilmedia.tw/about for details). The site originated from a research proj- ect funded by the National Science Foundation, Taiwan, in 2007–2012, and was oﬃcially established in 2012. The site aims to record social movements that are ignored in mainstream media. By using interviews and video recordings, these movements and events can be shared with the public as another resource to understand social events. There are more than 1500 records in the database in the past ﬁve years. These records are not limited to media-related events. In fact, the database includes details on human rights, cultural issues, immigra- tion, tax reform, community news, education, social welfare, and other events and topics. Civilmedia.tw also works with a PTS program to broadcast impor- tant social movements every week. In addition, civilmedia.tw is connected to social networking sites—including Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus—to reach more people and have more interaction with the public. WeReport.org was established by the Quality News Development Associa- tion at the media reform annual meeting in May 2011. On December 3, 2013, wereport.org was oﬃcially launched online. It is the ﬁrst nonproﬁt investigative report platform and is supported by donations from the public. By posting one’s proposal for a news reporting project, donors can choose projects they would like to support. Since 2011, there have been more than ﬁve hundred donors and more than thirty-seven projects proposed on the platform. Similar to civilme- dia.tw, weReport.org also has outlets on social networking sites, including Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, Plurk, and RSS. MEDIA STRATEGIES IN TAIWAN Overall, these important media reform organizations and websites were origi- nally proposed by media scholars and social movement activists. They started by forming a small association and then looked for alliances and, most impor- tantly, the participation of the public. Websites and social networking sites (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Plurk) are essential platforms to reach more people. Open platform and open access are the principles shared by these orga- nizations. They also cooperate with each other with regard to improving media performance and citizen journalism in Taiwan. Similar to the strategies used by Free Press and other media reform activists in the United States, social persuasion and grassroots movements have also been utilized by media reform activists in Taiwan (Lo 2012). Media watch and media literacy education, alternative media, media labor protests, and media policy advocacy are all important strategies used by media reform activists in Taiwan (Lo 2012). Besides, many diﬀerent institutions and organizations have been involved in these media-reform–related movements. With regard to media reform, collab- oration is more helpful and more useful than letting every tub stand on its own (Ryan and Gamson 2011). CONCL USION Media reform movements in Taiwan have fought for freedom of speech and a more democratic media environment. These movements started from ﬁghting for media privatization and liberalization to remove the inﬂuence of political parties, government, and military over the mass media, to ﬁghting media monopolies in order to protect the diversity of media and a wide range of ideas. During the past ten years, media reform movements have been growing, lead- ing to the establishment of civil society in Taiwan. The ﬁght against government control is not easy. Still, it is no less diﬃcult for the public to see the importance of separating political parties, government, and military from broadcasters. To achieve this goal, protests and public cri- tiques concerning mass media were made, leading to public discussions and eventually to legal reform. The path for ﬁghting against a media monopoly in Taiwan mentioned in this chapter can be concluded as COMEPA: comments, media, exposure, protest, allies. This chapter argues that a coalition that consisted of a number of schol- ars, media reform groups (such as Taiwan Media Watch and the Campaign of Media Reform in Taiwan), various kinds of social groups, and the public can be a powerful force to express the opinions of the public. First of all, scholars and media reform groups need to create an agenda to draw the public’s atten- tion. Second, it is essential to form alliances with various social groups to generate more comments, host workshops, and create protests (online and oﬄine). Both the traditional media and online social media can be used to express their views. Furthermore, public participation is the key to success. These are strategies used in the anti–media monopoly movements in Taiwan to inﬂuence the government to prevent the formation of media monopoly that might impede the freedom of speech. However, these strategies have their limitations and challenges. As mentioned above, with great media exposure through traditional mass media and social media, these movements reached a considerable amount of people to participate in the movements. However, there remains an “unreach- able” public; reaching every person continues to be a big challenge for media reform movements. In addition, the existence of a “cold” public is another challenge. To improve the awareness of the importance of media reform, similar to the NCMR (National Conference for Media Reform) hosted by the Free Press in the United States, the Campaign for Media Reform and Media Watch Taiwan have hosted media reform meetings annually. Media Watch also provides courses on media education, including media literacy and the production of citizen jour- nalism. However, only limited people can sign up for these courses. It is essen- tial to cooperate with more local communities and schools to provide media literacy education and to persuade the public on the importance of media reform. Last but not least, the ongoing media reform movements that are ﬁghting media monopoly and pressing for a more independent and well-functioning public media system have presented a real challenge. Still, as McChesney (2007, 1) has pointed out, “we are in the midst of a communication and infor- mation revolution.” Fighting for a completely independent public broadcast- ing system remains diﬃcult. When the media system is partially funded by the government, maintaining its accountability while ensuring its sustainability has been a dilemma in many countries around the world. Media reform still has a long way to go.","completion":"# CHAPTER TWELVE: Media Reform Movements in Taiwan By Hsin-Yi Sandy Tsai, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan & Shih-Hung Lo, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY Media reform strategies in Taiwan have been largely effective in raising awareness and influencing government policies on media freedom and media democratization. Reform movements addressed issues including public media promotion and opposition to media mergers, leveraging public engagement and lobbying, while also confronting hostility from mainstream media and a passive government response. New and social media have become key tools for advancing media reform goals. THE CHANGING MEDIA LANDSCAPE IN TAIWAN Taiwan, transitioning from an authoritarian regime to a more open society, faced significant media transformation with liberalization and privatization. Despite increased media outlets, major concerns remain over media consolidation, commercialism, and the impact on the quality and diversity of content. MEDIA REFORM MOVEMENTS IN TAIWAN Taiwan experienced three waves of media reform: (1) privatization and liberalization post-martial law; (2) the push for expanding public media; and (3) battling significant media mergers. The formation of Public Television Services (PTS) and Taiwan Broadcasting Service (TBS) was a major achievement for media reform, emphasizing public service and independence from government influence. THE CAMPAIGN FOR EXPANDING PUBLIC MEDIA The second wave fought to create capable public media entities that offer quality and diverse content with universality, independence, and a focus on serving the public interest. Advocacy led to significant debate surrounding the establishment and management of PTS and TBS. THE FIGHT OVER BIG MEDIA MERGERS Market consolidation became a concern with the advent of media convergence, leading to activism against mergers like Want Want China Times' attempts to acquire multiple media platforms. Intense review, public opposition, and pressure influenced the National Communications Commission (NCC) to eventually disapprove of the mergers. ASSESSMENT Reform movements began with protests and critique, later incorporating diverse strategies to engage public interest and apply political pressure. The COMEPA framework (comments, media, exposure, protest, allies) was instrumental in rallying opposition to media monopolies and influencing government action. However, achieving widespread public reach and engagement remains a consistent challenge. THE RELEVANCE OF ALTERNATIVE AND CITIZEN MEDIA Media activists were proactive in creating platforms such as Civilmedia.tw and WeReport.org to cultivate citizen journalism and offer alternatives to mainstream media. These enabled broader participation and provided independent coverage of events often neglected by traditional outlets. CONCLUSION The future of media reform in Taiwan will continue to challenge the status quo, seeking highly independent public media systems while contending with governmental funding-related dilemmas. The reform efforts aim not only at policy changes but also to enhance media literacy and engage local communities further in the movement. The vision is clear: a democratic media landscape that genuinely serves the public."},{"prompt":"فصل بعدی : CHAPTER THIRTEEN Organizing for Media Reform in Canada Media Democracy Day, OpenMedia, and Reimagine CBC KATHLEEN CR OSS , Simon Fraser University, Canada DAv ID SKINNER, York University, Canada MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY A review of three contemporary media reform initiatives in Anglophone Canada oﬀers four insights on organizing media reform initiatives: (1) Understand your regional and national context. To frame campaigns and create a broad base of sup- port, organizations need to know the history of media development in their jurisdic- tions, the current competing power structures and discourses about the media, and the unique barriers to media reform. (2) Seek collaborations and coalitions. Net- working and collaborating with other organizations, campaigns, and events can help enhance organizational reach and resources, as well as increase awareness of the need for media reform in other social-justice ﬁelds and organizations. (3) Seek sup- port from academic institutions. Support from universities and colleges can help legitimate reform organizations; add expertise to campaigns, regulatory proceedings, and public debates; and generate volunteers through student placements and intern- ships. (4) Use multiple campaign approaches and modes of engagement. Online campaign tactics (such as e-petitions or social media organizing) combined with oﬄine traditional communications tactics (such as town hall discussions, street teams, or presentations to regulatory committees) engage the largest number of peo- ple. Similarly, campaign goals should be framed in simple, straightforward terms that can be easily grasped by people of diﬀerent ages and diverse backgrounds. This chapter examines three contemporary media reform initiatives in Anglo- phone Canada: (1) Media Democracy Day (MDD), an annual public event in 167 Vancouver British Columbia that brings together community groups, scholars, activists and independent media practitioners to develop strategies for democ- ratizing media content and structure; (2) OpenMedia (OM), an organization that has had substantial success bringing pressure on the media regulatory arena using social media and online organizing tools; and (3) Reimagine CBC, a national campaign conducted by a coalition of three youth-oriented activist groups in response to political and ﬁnancial challenges mounted against the Canadian public broadcaster. Set against the larger backdrop of media reform in Canada, it brieﬂy high- lights the historical conditions and circumstances that frame contemporary media reform eﬀorts in Canada and considers the successes and challenges these campaigns have had in animating broader public interest and achieving particular media reform–related goals. It considers their communication strat- egies, use of social media, and involvement in coalition building, and it exam- ines their lessons learned in developing campaigns, engaging with those new to media reform goals, and approaches to developing relationships with wider movements for social justice. Of particular interest are the ways they have man- aged to overcome traditional barriers to reform, as well as the ways in which the larger political economic conditions have worked to circumscribe their growth and development. Finally, drawing from the experiences of these cases we sug- gest four broad organizational strategies for media reform initiatives. DE VEL OP ING A CTIVISM Canada has a long history of citizen’s groups, labor organizations, and academ- ics agitating for comprehensive media and telecommunications systems that serve the public interest (Babe 1990; Girard 1992; Goldberg 1990; Hackett and Carroll 2006). But such activism has been spotty and much of it has been conﬁned to simply testifying at the many federal government enquiries and commissions over the years (Canada 1970, 1981, 2005, 2006). Once these formal inquiries were over, there was very little pressure on the government of the day to follow up on recommendations and, generally, they have not done so (Skinner and Gasher 2005). In some quarters, this has led to the conclusion that perhaps the only way to get reform on legislative and regula- tory agendas is through broad and sustained public pressure (Creery 1984). However, with a few exceptions, public pressure has not been developed in a sustained way. There are at least three reasons for this diﬃculty. First, there is the structure of the regulatory process itself. Participating in that process is expensive and requires considerable resources in terms of time, money, and knowledge. Take the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), Canada’s broadcast and telecommunications regulator, for example. Hearings are generally conducted in Ottawa, making attendance in person dif- ﬁcult. At the same time, keeping up with the CRTC’s regulatory agenda and undertaking the research necessary to understand the possible social, political, and economic impacts of the issues it addresses is very diﬃcult without consid- erable time for research, or the beneﬁt of paid staﬀ, something very few besides major media corporations can aﬀord. Participating in other regulatory pro- cesses requires similar resources. A second, related problem is funding for nongovernment and noncorporate organizations in Canada. In the United States, media activist organizations such as Free Press and the Media and Democracy Coalition receive signiﬁcant funding from foundations, philanthropic organizations, and institutional members. In Canada, with its small population and history of branch plant industry, access to such resources is severely limited (Skinner 2012). Third, prior to the Internet, developing a broad base of support for media reform without the resources to mount high-proﬁle publicity campaigns, com- plete with direct mail or telephone contacts, was an almost impossible task. This is further complicated by the fact that media reform is often viewed by activists in ﬁelds such as labor, race, gender, or environment as secondary to their primary concerns (Hackett and Carroll 2006, 199–209). All three examples of media reform activism discussed in this section address these obstacles: Media Democracy Day through utilizing a range of techniques to build public awareness of, and participation in, media reform issues and concerns; and OpenMedia.ca and Reimagine CBC through using both Internet-based social networks and broadly focused campaign strategies to develop and expedite media reform campaigns. m EDIA DEmOCRACY DAY The ﬁrst Media Democracy Day (MDD) was organized in Vancouver and Toronto in 2001 in response to escalating concentration of media ownership and its attendant threats to the diversity of media content. Since that time, similar events have been organized across Canada and the United States, as well as in Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. But it has enjoyed its greatest success in Vancouver where over the last four years it has evolved into one of the premiere media reform events in Canada where—with two days of panel discussions, ﬁlm screenings, keynote talks, workshops, and a media fair—it attracts over three thousand attendees. MDD’s action plan is reﬂected in the tag line, “Know the media. Be the media. Change the media.” To know the media, refers to the need for evidence-based research on ownership structures, production, and distribution patterns, labor practices, and patterns of media content. This forms the basis for eﬀecting change. To be the media signiﬁes the commitment to citizen input and alternative media content. In this regard, MDD activities include a trade show–style media fair of independent media groups, as well as hands-on training workshops. To change the media refers to questions of policy, regulation, and laws, including copyright legislation, Internet throttling, concentration of ownership, and sup- port for culturally important areas such as independent ﬁlmmaking and public broadcasting. MDD seeks to build the media reform movement through emphasizing the importance of “communicative democracy” (Hackett 2000) to new audiences and organizations every year, consciously pitching MDD as a gateway event to communities and organizations whose interests overlap with media reform goals, such as social groups and activist organizations whose issues are misrep- resented, underreported, or ignored by the corporate media. In this way, MDD organizers follow the advice of US media activist Robert McChesney (2005, 11) who—when speaking to other social justice activists—argued that “whatever your ﬁrst issue of concern, media had better be your second, because without change in the media, progress in your primary area is far less likely.” To develop program content, MDD also seeks input from this social justice community using both web-based targeted communication and small community meet- ings, and then approaches speciﬁc organizations directly to take part. For example, MDD 2012 included a panel discussion called “Muzzling the Scien- tists,” about the increasing media restrictions placed on government scientists by the Conservative federal government, and contacted numerous environ- mental organizations, scientist associations and science faculties at universities and colleges to advertise the event. Another panel, “Decolonizing the Media,” included representatives from the South Asian and aboriginal leadership and was targeted at their respective communities. Further, all the events are free of charge and held at the easily accessible main branch of the Vancouver Public Library in downtown Vancouver. MDD has been a successful strategy for increasing information sharing with both the general public and citizen engagement groups (demonstrated by the fact that over 50 percent of attendees in 2012 were new to MDD), and one that has also been a catalyst for new forms of media activism and independent journalism. For example, the award-winning online magazine The Tyee (www .thetyee.ca) was launched at MDD and similar collaborations have occurred through the media fair. The structure of MDD is based on collaborations between scholars, media practitioners, and social justice activists. The organizing committee is presently housed in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University, a critical communication program for the last forty years, and both faculty members and representatives of community organizations sit on the steering committee. As a joint university-community organization MDD seeks to provide a link between research and practice and works to ensure a combination of scholars, practi- tioners, and activists on every panel. The 2012 event program listed over thirty speakers, as well as additional partnerships with ﬁfteen groups and associations from seven postsecondary institutions, seventeen community and media spon- sors, four labor unions, and ﬁve other social justice organizations and media practitioners. In addition, over thirty independent media-making groups were highlighted at the media fair. Some partnerships have been particularly beneﬁcial over the last twelve years. The UBC School of Journalism has been a supporter of MDD and sees the event as an avenue for its students to learn about and conduct journalism in the public interest. Library and archivist associations have been mainstays at the event, as have civil liberties organizations and groups concerned about freedom of information and privacy rights. The collaborative nature of MDD appears to have helped sustain the organi- zation and its longevity can be attributed to a number of factors including its aﬃliation with Simon Fraser University, attention to broad-based community collaborations, and its triple foci of media analysis, policy change, and creating alternative media. Reaching out to new groups and organizations each year with program content that speaks to the importance of democratic media helps to recruit new supporters, volunteers, and donors. However, as with many projects, it is limited by resources and has yet to develop an ongoing and reli- able source of funding. MDD has periodic part-time staﬀ and relies on volun- teer eﬀorts primarily from the School of Communication and other academic institutions and social justice groups in Vancouver. Thus, an inordinate amount of time is spent fundraising and seeking small donations from other social justice groups. OpENmEDIA In May 2007, University of Windsor’s Communication Studies department convened a conference to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of Manufacturing Consent by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky (1989). Riding a wave of enthusiasm for media reform generated at that event, Steve Anderson, a gradu- ate student at Simon Fraser University’s School of Communication, set up Canadians for Democratic Media (CDM) in Vancouver, British Columbia. Aiming to establish an umbrella group of organizations drawn from both those involved in media reform as well as newcomers to the enterprise, CDM’s initial mandate was to “create a common front among groups promoting reform of print, broadcast, and web-based media” (CDM 2008, 2). Funding was cobbled together from small grants and in-kind donations from labor unions, other activist organizations, and individuals. A handful of academics and activists worked with Anderson to craft an organizational mandate and policy positions. For the ﬁrst two years CDM was involved with a range of campaigns broadly focused on issues surrounding concentration of ownership, community media, the Internet, and journalism. Their website provided campaign information, a place to sign people to their mailing list, and a page where people could make a direct submission to government hearings on these issues. CDM delegations made several trips to Ottawa to appear before hearings. The organization also published several reports related to media issues (Hackett and Anderson 2010). Based upon preliminary ﬁndings of one of these reports, CDM was rebranded in 2010 to reﬂect the growing strength of the open movement. The new name, OpenMedia (OM), reﬂected the organization’s commitment to pursuing and creating an open, accessible media system in Canada in both the public and private sectors. Money was very tight, however, and Anderson spent much of his time fundraising. About the same time, some large Canadian media companies began pursuing vertical integration between content and carriage (Krashinsky 2010; Laduran- taye 2010). The Internet and the wireless markets were key to these corporate plays, and the mergers sparked a series of struggles over the dimensions of pub- lic policy in this emerging ﬁeld. Net neutrality became a key site of struggle and, along with a number of other activist organizations, OM participated in several campaigns in this area. A major turning point for the organization and online organizing in Canada came in 2009 when OM launched the Stop the Meter campaign. This cam- paign sought to intervene in a CRTC decision to allow wholesale Internet providers the power to impose “usage-based billing” (pay per byte) on indepen- dent Internet service providers and, therefore, many Canadian Internet users. Deploying social media, and particularly Facebook, to accelerate the message, over the course of several months the Stop the Meter campaign garnered over three hundred thousand signatures to its online petition and ﬂooded the CRTC oﬃces with over one hundred thousand comments—an unprecedented level of public engagement with telecommunications policy. Interestingly, and without prompting from OM, many supporters created videos, comics, post- ers, T-shirts, websites, and other campaign materials, held protests in their local communities, and donated money for ads in major newspapers. The campaign pressured the CRTC to change their decision from one that favored the large telecommunications companies to one that has been characterized as more friendly to other stakeholders. The petition remains active to keep pressure on the CRTC and now has over ﬁve hundred thousand signatures. In the face of this apparent broad public concern and commitment to Internet access and aﬀordability, OM’s focus turned from media issues in general to those speciﬁ- cally related to the Internet. Recent OM campaigns have not matched the level of support of Stop the Meter, but some have drawn well over one hundred thousand signatures. In this regard, OM has set a new benchmark for online organizing in Canada, working through social media, campaign videos, and graphics. At the same time, OM has not abandoned traditional media strategies such as newspaper ads and letters to the editor. Campaign websites include a “letter to the editor” tool that allows supporters to easily draft and send letters, usually aimed at news- papers located in the target politicians’ home constituencies (cf. openmedia.ca/ letter). These tactics are combined with direct lobbying of both elected and nonelected oﬃcials and other traditional methods, such as presenting petitions at politicians’ oﬃces, to help build and sustain pressure for policy changes. While it is diﬃcult to gauge the impact of any one group or individual on public policy processes, OM does appear to have had inﬂuence on the out- come of a number of Internet-related issues (Payton 2013). Given its successes, OM’s work has also been recognized with a national award and employees are now regularly consulted by regulators, policy-makers, and the mainstream media. Over the last ﬁve years OM has grown from a loose association of like-minded groups and individuals to become what the organization itself refers to as a citizen-driven, pro-Internet community or movement (openmedia.ca/operate). Social media, and particularly Facebook, have been important in constructing this larger community. OM operates with a full-time staﬀ of more than ten, and their raised public proﬁle has enhanced fundraising opportunities. Indeed, while other activist organizations continue to play an important role in provid- ing resources and funding, almost 75 percent of donations in 2011 came from individuals (OM 2011). One of the keys to OM’s success in developing and maintaining their sup- porters is that they frame complex issues in simple, populist language that relates to everyday experience, particularly for young people. For instance, Stop the Meter (openmedia.ca/meter) took a rather arcane regulatory process dealing with the technicalities of Internet traﬃc management and presented it as put- ting a parking meter on individual Internet accounts. No Internet Lockdown (openmedia.ca/lockdown) presented legislation dealing with complex copyright and intellectual property law as containing provisions to lock down or restrict use of the Internet. And the highly secretive Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership trade negotiations were framed as an Internet trap (stopthetrap.net) which may result in a number of highly repressive laws and regulations negatively aﬀecting Inter- net activity. Campaign narratives also utilize a recognizable set of villains—Big Media or Big Telecom—and goals are framed in generalized populist terms such as the need for more choice, aﬀordability, openness, transparency, or account- ability. Both campaign framing and language are also carefully scrutinized to avoid alienating supporters who identify as coming from across the political spectrum. To promote political inclusivity, OM identiﬁes itself as a postpartisan organization (openmedia.ca/operate). The large constituency constructed through social media using these rhe- torical strategies, coupled with the fact that OM has been able to motivate people to sign petitions and directly contact politicians and regulators, legiti- mates the claim that they are a citizens’ movement. They have successfully overcome some of the ﬁnancial and geographical barriers to participation in regulatory processes in Ottawa and provided people a voice in that venue. But while OM has enjoyed considerable success, the organization’s growth and development has been circumscribed by its ﬁnancial circumstances. Revenue streams require constant tending and current reliance on supporter-based rev- enue has gone hand in hand with an increasing focus on Internet-related issues. REImAGINE CBC While OpenMedia’s major focus shifted to the Internet, it has at times contin- ued to collaborate with other organizations on broader issues of media and public service. One of the major projects that emerged in this regard was Re- imagine CBC which focused on protecting and strengthening Canada’s public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). While public broadcasting in Canada, as in many other jurisdictions, has been under attack for over a decade, the election of Stephen Harper’s Conser- vative government in 2006 saw the acceleration of budget cuts and calls for the complete defunding of the CBC. In the wake of these attacks, and an impend- ing CBC license renewal hearing, OpenMedia joined forces with Leadnow and Gen Why Media in January 2012 to launch a campaign designed to engage Canadians in a discussion about the value of the CBC and to encourage suggestions for making it more responsive to the interests of Canadians (Re- imagine CBC n.d.). Importantly, all three partners were known as youth- oriented and new media-savvy groups that emphasized civic engagement, participatory processes and public dialogue. Leadnow.ca was launched in March 2011, just before a federal election, with the intention of increasing democratic participation and voter turnout among youth Canada. Gen Why Media began in 2010 as a ﬁlm project (the name refers to generational theorists’ use of “generation Y” to categorize those born in the 1980s) and expanded to work toward changing social structures through events to encourage civic engagement. While Gen Why Media was primarily local, both OM and Lead- now.ca had the reach to make Reimagine CBC a national project. With these organizations’ youth-oriented supporters in mind, the campaign sought to inﬂuence the CBC’s strategic planning by developing a “crowd sourced plan to enable the CBC to take on a leadership position in the digital era” (Reimagine CBC 2012). The campaign began with a website launch in January 2012. They explicitly stated their starting principles as supporting the role of public media as “good for democracy” and the importance of the public broadcaster to become nimble in terms of new media and technology. Based on questions of how the CBC could be more interactive, community based, par- ticipatory, encourage citizen-powered culture, and foster creativity and collabo- ration, they asked Canadians to submit their ideas about the kind of public broadcaster they wanted the CBC to be. In this way, they built an online com- munity and an initial list of ideas and opinions. The website also encouraged people to post their own ideas and comments. The site also included testimo- nials from artists, writers, educators, and others to advertise the campaign. Another section of the website allowed people to celebrate their favorite CBC moments, collecting stories and memories of the role of the public broadcaster in people’s lives. Running from January to April 2012, almost 1,500 Canadians took part in this ﬁrst phase of the campaign. At the same time, Reimagine CBC created an online and paper-based peti- tion that called on the government to stop the cuts to the CBC in the upcoming federal budget. The petition garnered more than twenty-ﬁve thousand signatures, and volunteers hand-delivered these petitions to thirteen Member of Parliament (MP) constituency oﬃces. Nonetheless, the spring budget announced a 10 per- cent cut to the CBC, and the Reimagine CBC campaign switched its focus to the CBC license renewal hearings upcoming in the fall. Importantly, the campaign was not limited to web-based tactics, but used multifaceted strategies to engage Canadians in this broad-based consultation. They conducted person-to-person engagement events, including street teams, visits to senior homes, and a youth-oriented public event. Four months into the campaign, Reimagine CBC was ready to report to the public about what they had heard so far. They did so with a large public event held on May 7, 2012, in Vancouver. Over one thousand people attended and some ﬁve hun- dred people watched via webcam. They reported on the ﬁrst phase of the campaign and included performances from spoken-word poets, musicians, writers, and a panel discussion about how to make the CBC stronger and more relevant to Canadians. Over the next few months, organizers developed a modular survey from the crowdsourcing feedback that reﬂected a list of six major priorities highlighted by the participants. During this second phase of the consultation process, people were encouraged to rank these priorities in order of importance. In all, almost eleven thousand people participated in this online survey. At the same time the campaign held twenty-eight gatherings across the county to seek feed- back from those who may not yet have had a chance to comment. By the time the campaign held its second large public event in Toronto in October 2012, it was clear that Reimagine CBC had conducted one of the most creative and comprehensive public consultation processes ever seen about the future of the CBC or the role of media in Canada. In all, over thirty-ﬁve thousand people participated in the consultation process in one way or another. Its ﬁnal report, Make It Yours, was submitted to the CRTC at the CBC’s licensing hearing in November 2012. It was clear from the consultation that Canadians were deeply supportive of the public broadcaster. The survey put the highest priority on “courageous” and “in-depth” reporting as the key to CBC purpose. The other four recommendations included prioritizing radio, enriching the digital archive, collaborating with communities more to develop authentic Canadian stories, and using open and participatory processes to help shape CBC’s vision. Upon presentation of the report to the CRTC the campaign earned praise from the CRTC chair as a model of citizen participation. Why did this campaign have such buy-in from the public? Collaboration, public engagement, a combination of web-based and traditional communica- tion methods, creative approaches, cross-generational focus—all of these ele- ments combined to help build public participation. ORGANIZ ATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR MEDIA REFORM Each of these Canadian examples takes a diﬀerent approach to media reform. MDD’s focus is to hold public events, create a platform for media reform col- laborations, and increase the capacity and opportunity for alternative media content. One of the advantages of MDD pitching its events to new communi- ties of interest, and facilitating collaborations, is that it has succeeded in creating a sustainable event that attracts thousands of people a year, many of whom are new to media reform. However, while building public awareness of media issues, there is no way to gauge the organization’s impact on public policy or the media environment in general. Working from another position, OM was forged in the peculiar political economy of the Canadian media system to become eﬀective Internet-oriented campaigners for policy change around primarily Internet-oriented issues. Uti- lizing social media and careful rhetorical framing of issues, it has been able to develop a very large set of supporters and thus overcome some of the traditional ﬁnancial barriers to organizing media reform eﬀorts in Canada. But in its eﬀorts to establish a ﬁrm base of support, it appears to have somewhat limited the range of its campaigning work. Finally, Reimagine CBC was a collaborative project that had the express pur- pose of conducting a short intensive campaign in support of the public broad- caster and focused on its license renewal hearing as the ﬁnal goal. It was unprecedented in its scope, use of multifaceted tactics, and public engagement, but was disbanded soon after the CRTC hearing and had no follow-up capacity. These three examples oﬀer some interesting ideas and insights on how to engage people in media reform, notwithstanding their diﬀerent goals and unique positioning. Four of these insights are discussed in the following sections. UNDERSTAND YOUR REGIONAL AND NATIONAL CONTEXT While it may seem obvious, it is worth emphasizing the importance of under- standing the issues, debates, and struggles that give rise to the policies and structures media reform groups are trying to change. National media systems arise out of diﬀerent political and economic pressures, and thus social and historical context oﬀers insight to tailoring strategies for media reform. For instance, in Canada, regional diﬀerences in media access and coverage some- times call for diﬀerent campaign approaches in diﬀerent locales. What works on the West Coast where media ownership concentration is particularly high, does not always play the same way in the center of the country where there is more media choice. Similarly, drawing upon the country’s peculiar mythology about media development and the role of the media in democracy can oﬀer opportunities for framing campaigns. For example, Canada’s historical debates about cultural sovereignty vis-à-vis the United States have been evoked in a number of campaigns (cf. OM’s Fair Deal Campaign). At another level, learn- ing from and strategically positioning oneself in relation to the work of other domestic reform groups can be important. The Reimagine CBC campaign did not merely repeat the work of others who have championed the CBC; rather it drew upon traditional narrative and rationales for public broadcasting while using knowledge of youth and web cultures and an understanding of crowd- sourcing methods to fashion a unique dialogue about a renewed public service model. Thus, it created new tactics for championing an old institution. Finally, understanding the national context also means acknowledging barriers to media reform. For example, MDD has recognized the lack of public knowledge and opportunities for engagement about media reform issues, and responded by pitching its work at an entry level, oﬀering discussions and events that help edu- cate people about media reform issues and concerns. Similarly, recognizing the diﬃculty in accomplishing fundamental political and policy change, OM’s cam- paigns generally focus upon incremental policy change. And, because Canada lacks many philanthropic foundations from which to raise core funding, organiz- ers have had to be particularly creative in fundraising. SEEK COLLABORATIONS AND COALITIONS All three examples networked with a range of social justice groups and organiza- tions who were not strictly involved in the media reform movement, thereby building their reach and resources. OM works to create a large constituency by making a claim to postpartisanship which can, at times, limit the range and depth of their progressive actions but, at the same time, has been successful at creating coalitions with groups that might not have traditionally supported its work. For its Stop the Meter campaign, it joined with consumer interest groups whose political orientation was diﬀerent from OM’s, but whose goals in this campaign were similar: aﬀordable Internet access. Depending on the situation, it has also forged alliances with unions as well as small telecommunications companies and other private sector organizations whose goals and ambitions meet with the objectives of particular campaigns. While such partnerships can draw criticism for being opportunist, they can also provide much needed resources and can make the diﬀerence between success and failure. Further, both MDD and Reimagine CBC are examples of coalition-building approaches that generated interest with groups and citizens outside of the media reform sector. Short-term campaign-speciﬁc collaborations with other social justice groups can also oﬀer the beneﬁt of doubling up on memberships and mail-lists, with- out the long-term headache of requiring agreement on long-term goals. Seeking collaborations, however, may have drawbacks. For instance, media reform groups need to be careful about overidentifying with particular political parties rather than speciﬁc policy proposals. SEEK SUppORT FRO m ACADE m IC INSTITUTIONS While support from institutions such as foundations and unions can be invalu- able, we cannot emphasize enough the important role of scholars and their academic institutions in providing resources and support for the work of media reform. While, as a scholar, taking on the role of reform advocate may have consequences, such academic alliances create a level of legitimacy for the orga- nization; add expertise to campaign outcomes, regulatory proceedings, and public debates; and can serve as vehicles of critical pedagogy for postsecondary students. All three examples reviewed here emerged or were assisted by aca- demic involvement. The ﬁrst Media Democracy Day in 2001 originated in part through the work of graduates and faculty in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University. This aﬃliation with SFU continues today, as other faculty members have become leaders in the organization and new graduate and undergraduate students have become involved. The university is a great source of student volunteers and annual funding for MDD which, while extremely limited, still provides a basis of continuity. Similarly, the academy played an important role in animating the development of OM and provided both tech- nical and material support in the early days of its development. Several of the founders were university professors and Steve Anderson was an alumnus of both graduate and undergraduate communication programs. Because OM is based in Vancouver, the School of Communication at Simon Fraser is an important source of student interns and staﬀ, and scholars aﬃliated with other academic institutions across the country have also been involved as board members and collaborators, while student clubs have formed at other univer- sities, such as McGill University in Montreal. As the organization grew and became self-sustaining, the role of the academy became less important, but scholars continue to legitimate OM campaigns by delivering expert testimony at regulatory hearings and assisting with policy and research documents. USE mULTI p LE CAmpAIGN AppROACHES AND m ODES OF ENGAGEmENT Finally, all three of these examples show the importance of using both tradi- tional and new media campaign techniques to reach both the public and policy makers. OM has created impressive online campaigns and Reimagine CBC utilized a simple yet eﬀective online consultation and collaboration approach. Yet, all three examples also highlight the importance of traditional campaign tools, such as town hall discussions, street teams, large public events, circulat- ing hard copy petitions, and directly engaging politicians and regulators. For instance, Reimagine CBC visited community centers and senior citizens’ homes. OM conducts street interventions, delivers hard copy petitions to political oﬃces, sends out traditional press releases and encourages letters to the editors of newspapers. MDD seeks out radio interviews, submits editorial columns to newspapers and makes classroom visits to post-secondary classes. CONCL USION All three examples emphasize participation in their campaigns, providing people with a range of possible ways to become involved—from organizing and creating campaign materials, to directly voicing speciﬁc concerns, to attending public events or simply signing a petition. At the same time, all three illustrate that campaign goals need to be framed in simple, straightforward terms that can be easily grasped by people of diﬀerent ages and with diverse backgrounds and education. All three have also illustrated that public meetings can be an important means of developing and galvanizing public interest in reform. And OpenMedia and Reimagine CBC have shown that online activ- ism can help break down traditional barriers to the regulatory process and enable large numbers of people to make their voices heard. While some media reform groups may be more comfortable with either traditional or new media organizing, it appears that it is the combination of these activities that fueled the success of these three examples.","completion":"# CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Organizing for Media Reform in Canada By Kathleen Cross, Simon Fraser University, Canada & David Skinner, York University, Canada MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY The chapter examines three Canadian media reform initiatives: Media Democracy Day (MDD), OpenMedia (OM), and Reimagine CBC. It offers four strategic insights for organizing media reform: understanding the regional and national context, forming collaborations and coalitions, acquiring support from academic institutions, and employing multiple campaign approaches and engagement modes. DEVELOPING ACTIVISM Media reform activism in Canada has traditionally been limited to testifying at government inquiries. The obstacles include the prohibitive cost of participation in the regulatory process, limited funding sources, and the challenge of developing public support without widespread campaigns. MDD, OM, and Reimagine CBC have engaged in creative strategies to address these barriers. MEDIA DEMOCRACY DAY (MDD) MDD in Vancouver has evolved into a major annual event focused on democratizing media content and structure. It promotes public engagement and facilitates alternative media content. MDD is sustained through collaboration between academic institutions, community groups, and social justice organizations, offering versatile programs meant to raise awareness about media reform. OPENMEDIA (OM) OM stands out for its success in utilizing social media and online organizing tools to bring pressure on media regulation, exemplified by the impactful \\"Stop the Meter\\" campaign. OM effectively frames complex issues in simple language that resonates with the general public and has developed into a significant movement for Internet-oriented policy change. REIMAGINE CBC Reimagine CBC was a national campaign focused on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's public broadcasting role. Through broad-based consultations, they crafted a crowdsourced plan for a more interactive, community-focused CBC. The campaign attracted significant public participation and engagement. ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR MEDIA REFORM Canada's unique media landscape, characterized by limited funding and geographical barriers, demands innovative and inclusive strategies for media reform. MDD, OM, and Reimagine CBC showcase different approaches, from public events to digital activism, but all underscore the necessity for clear communication, broad engagement, and diversified tactics. DEVELOPING ACTIVISM Persistent activism and the adaptation to various communication platforms have been integral in gaining momentum for media reform in Canada. OM stands out for its significant online presence and success in policy influence, while MDD's nurturing of academic-community collaborations helps sustain ongoing awareness and activism. CONCLUSION Media reform in Canada continues to face challenges but through collaborative efforts, strategic understanding of the media landscape, and innovative campaigns, significant strides are being made toward fulfilling media reform goals and engaging the public in the process. The interplay of online and offline activism and clear messaging ensures wider reach and impact."},{"prompt":"فصل بعدی : CHAPTER FOURTEEN The Battle Over Low-Power FM in the United States HANNAH SASSA m AN AND p ETE TRIDISH , Prometheus Radio Project, United States MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY Five lessons learned from the ﬁght for low-power FM (LPFM) radio in the United States: (1) Nothing beats a passionate grassroots eﬀort. Even though Prometheus was a tiny outﬁt working out of a two-room church basement, we were able to harness the power of people who felt robbed of the community radio they needed. (2) Local voices with meaningful stories will be heard. We encouraged people to share detailed, personal stories with legislators about how their community could use a radio station. In crowded Washington, DC, with big corporate media lob- byists shaking hands and sharing meals with our elected representatives, we found that stories about local issues spoke louder than the richest broadcasters in the world. (3) Change takes time. It took our grassroots eﬀorts ten years to get a propublic interest correction through, so choose your issues wisely. (4) Focus on the long term. The industry always has its insider advantages in the short term. Choose campaigns that will keep on making a diﬀerence in the long term, and stick with them long enough to win them. (5) Community-building events strengthen movements for the long haul. If we can come together outside of campaign work—outside of calling Congress, signing petitions, taking action— we will build a more permanent understanding of the lines that divide us and keep big media strong. In the mid-1990s, the movement for media reform in the United States was at a low ebb. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 moved through Congress with the fawning support of the corporate deregulatory agenda of both parties. Americans started to feel the eﬀect within months, with hundreds of mergers and buyouts by big media corporations leading to waves of ﬁrings and loss of vital local programming. In response, hundreds of small bands of activists started unlicensed, or pirate, FM radio stations, in hopes of recapturing a sliver of the public air- waves for their communities. Their goal? To give voice to those being silenced by the commercial media. We saw that whether we were ﬁghting for housing reform, an AIDS cure, peace, the environment, or anything else, a small number of corporations had a chokehold on the public’s information and were using their media properties to narrow the contours of debate and the imagination about possible solutions. We took our inspiration from Mbanna Kantako, a blind DJ in a housing project in Illinois who started a tenants’ rights radio station; and Stephen Dunifer, a peace activist and engineer who ran an antiwar radio station out of a backpack from the hills in Berkeley, California. In Dunifer’s case, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) tried and failed for four years to get the courts to issue an injunction against his broadcasts. Eventually, his station was shut down in 1998, but not before close to one thousand pirate radio stations had started up in the shadow of the legal whirlpool caused by his (almost successful) case against the system of broadcast laws. The FCC’s response to the unlicensed stations was twofold. First, the enforcement branch pursued ﬁnes, equipment conﬁscations, and injunctions against radio pirates. The legal confusion created by the Dunifer case created a situation much like the historic (and mythic) Wild West in the United States: the rule of law was temporarily in question as the courts reevaluated the FCC’s performance in distributing radio licenses fairly. In the vacuum of authority that followed, freewheeling radio pirates, from immigrants to anarchists to art- ists, broadcast voices that had never been heard in the mainstream. Second, FCC Chairman William Kennard, who expressed concern about the trend toward radio industry consolidation and loss of diversity of ownership, engaged the pirates to create a new, licensed, hyper-local community radio service for the country: low-power FM radio. Former radio pirates formed a national group, the Prometheus Radio Proj- ect, to help steer the political debate around the new licenses, and to assist groups technically and organizationally that wanted to give voice to their communities using radio. With Kennard’s leadership, the FCC designed the LPFM service and opened the door for thousands of community groups to apply for licenses. The battle with big broadcasting was far from over, however, as incumbents pushed Congress to pass an anti-LPFM bill in late 2000 that limited the FCC’s authority to grant the licenses, adding onerous restrictions that kept LPFM out of most of America’s big cities. Prometheus led a coalition in a ten-year eﬀort to restore FCC authority over community radio, and to allow community radio stations into the cities. This eﬀort was ﬁnally successful when Congress passed the Local Community Radio Act, signed by President Obama in Janu- ary 2011. THE PR OMETHEUS RADIO PR OJECT The campaign to expand low-power FM was a transformative one for the Pro- metheans who took it on. Prometheus’s founders had experience organizing demonstrations and direct actions against the City of Philadelphia, against national Republicans setting up shop in town for the Republican National Convention, as well as for many other local struggles. But we’d never had the impact to change federal regulations before, or pass laws through Congress. We weren’t really big league enough to take on the Federal government, and the Feds weren’t quite ready for us either. When thousands of LPFM applicants were denied their chance to get a com- munity radio license, we saw a constituency spread across the country. But this constituency was made up of people very unlike each other: people who wanted to have radio stations for very diﬀerent reasons. From two rooms in a West Philadelphia church basement, and from the back of an old car that had seen better days, we met the thousands who had lost their opportunity for their dream of building a community radio station including evangelical Christians in Merritt Island, Florida; Latino labor coalitions in Indianapolis; anarchists in Philadelphia; and the black Chamber of Commerce in Sacramento. We developed a practice of deep conversation with all sorts of people about the unmet communications needs of their communities, and let their passion lead us. We listened to each group as they described why they wanted to be on the air, and helped them to respect the reasons provided by thousands of oth- ers. We needed to meet people where they were and to amplify to decision- makers the individual reasons why people wanted stations. One thing that helped us cross ideological lines was our emphasis on localism. In the wake of the wave of corporate mergers, many people had lost the traditional connec- tion that they had with local radio. More and more of the program content was nationally syndicated, and radio hosts—from the Left or the Right—became more distant and unapproachable and less connected to the particular town that the signal was covering. Our belief was that just like you don’t just have a president—you also have a governor and a mayor and a school board mem- ber—you need a media that has a mix of scales too. There is nothing wrong with having national media outlets, but some room on the dial needs to be reserved for smaller, local voices. This resonated for everyone, including Republicans who have often argued against the over-extension of federal pow- ers. Libertarian Congress members, like Ron Paul of Texas, wanted to hear from local people who wanted the freedom to have their voice on the air, without government or corporate intervention. Left-leaning Congress members, like Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, wanted to hear about locals missing the diversity of local radio and the viewpoints of marginalized groups. Members of the Con- gressional Black Caucus and Congress members supporting immigrant voices wanted to hear about chances for minority nonproﬁts and businesses to share powerful stories, and to put power in the hands of marginalized groups to orga- nize for themselves. Coming from a history where the FCC only considered comments from lawyers in the rulemaking process, and tossed comments from the public in the wastepaper basket, this strategy seemed unorthodox. Treating individual voices like unique ﬂowers and delivering those ﬂowers to Congress members one, two, three at a time? No way. But we saw our methods start to work and change minds, one at a time, in Congress. In 2007, after a number of false starts in the House led by Democratic legislators without Republican backing and after a dogged bipartisan Senate team failed to push through big broadcaster opposition to LPFM expansion, Congressman Mike Doyle and his passionate legislative aide Kenneth Degraﬀ approached us. They said that they had worked before with conservative Omaha, Nebraska, Congressman Lee Terry, and if we could demonstrate that there was powerful interest in LPFM in Omaha, he would have the wherewithal to stand up to the big broadcasters and cosponsor a bill to expand LPFM radio in the committee where it mattered the most. We went deep in Omaha. We found applicants from African-American community organizations, local churches, and the YMCA who had wanted a radio station but who had lost out when Congress limited the LPFM service. In Omaha, the voices of these leaders meant a lot to Congressman Terry. He agreed to cosponsor the bill, and we had a bill to expand LPFM that was viable. Once we saw this formula work, we just kept the turntable spinning with local variations on the same theme. We refreshed and maintained connections with new and former LPFM applicants at community radio station “barnrais- ings”—an event taken from the Amish tradition of communities coming together to build a barn in a day or two—where we build an entire LPFM radio station over the weekend. We moved through legislative cycles, getting a little further each time. Each breakthrough with a legislator was a small, nour- ishing victory that allowed us to keep going. Our allies in the Senate patiently moved the bill forward each session until they reached a ceiling and then we would try again. As the years went by, our “DC drag” got threadbare and sometimes our spirits did too. We got tired and angry when allies described our campaign as “low-hanging fruit” in the ﬁght for media reform. We got exhausted explaining why National Public Radio and the big, conservative, commercial broadcasters at the National Association of Broadcasters were working together to kill our little stations. We hit something of a turning point in 2005. When Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts and other parts of the Gulf, communications systems broke down for millions. Of the forty-two radio stations lining the Gulf coast, only four mostly stayed on the air during the storm—and two of those were LPFM radio stations. WQRZ-LP in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, was so important for helping the Hancock County resi- dents ﬁnd shelter, family members, and resources that the local emergency services agencies invited them to set up shop with them and broadcast hyper- local emergency information along with the Zydeco and other local music that comforted survivors’ frayed nerves. Telling that story expanded our coalition further, bringing in emergency services leaders together with civil rights, social justice, libertarian, and right- and-left religious organizations all pushing for LPFM radio. After the wave of new Congress members in 2008, we were able to move bills through the House and Senate much more quickly. But we were working against time, as well. While 91.5 percent of Americans continued to rely on radio at least once every week (Radio Advertising Bureau 2014) LPFM advocates increasingly had to contend with statements like “Doesn’t everyone have an iPhone now?” and “Why does radio matter?” We continued to get hundreds of calls a week from radio hopefuls including speakers of Hmong and Haitian Creole, students and seniors, pastors and parents. We knew however that our time was running out with Congress increasingly interested in shiny new things. By December 2010, the campaign for LPFM had reached a make-or-break junction. We were burning out as a result of years of hitting our heads against intractable opponents and a do-nothing Congress. We were just days from the end of the legislative session, and if we did not pass our bill through the Senate, we would have to start from scratch in the new year. Our bill had passed the House, and passed the appropriate communications-focused subcommittee and committee in the Senate. It was up for “unanimous consent” in the Senate. Our opponents at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), led by former Republican Senator Gordon Smith, were stopping our bill using a series of anonymous holds by Senators in red states. In order to break a hold like this, we had to discover who was behind it, then mobilize constituents, create public pressure and local press stories in the state until the Senators’ staﬀ buckled and released the hold. We had little time to act—maybe two weeks before legislators went home for Christmas and closed all pending bills, which would have to be rebooted from scratch the next session. Experienced lobbyists advised us that we were better oﬀ hanging it up and trying again next session. We needed to turn up the pressure. This was very divisive in our group. Some of us felt we would lose all the legitimacy we had built up if we made fools of ourselves for nothing. But what was all that legitimacy for anyway, if we didn’t win? Danielle Chynoweth, the leader who had built WRFN-LP in Urbana, Illi- nois, and a seasoned campaigner who joined our team for the last years of the campaign, came up with the idea of a hula hoop demonstration. We called our friends who could juggle, do ﬂips and splits, and were willing to “clown around” to help create a makeshift circus in front of the NAB’s national head- quarters. Our goal was to bring attention to the circus the NAB was making out of American democracy with their dirty Senate procedural tricks and insider string-pulling. Our slogan was “Stop making low-power FM radio jump through so many hoops!” (see Figure 14–1). The demonstration was a success. The NAB locked their front doors, letting no one in or out of the building for an hour, clearly concerned that we might take over their lobby with our hooping. We got a ton of press, and thousands of people watched a three-minute video we made of the event. The decisive story was an article in Politico (Martinez 2010). The reporter not only inter- viewed us and the NAB, but also other organizations that were having similar issues with the NAB at the same time, such as the cable industry and the music licensing industry. They echoed our claim that the NAB was using dirty politi- cal tricks—a move that deﬁnitely helped our cause. The NAB surrendered two days later, and on January 6, 2011, President Obama signed the bill that would expand community radio to thousands of communities nationwide. The bill lifted the restrictions that made it impossible to apply for licenses in cities, making it possible that most moderate-sized cities would have at least four or ﬁve channels available, and even the densest markets (like here in Philadelphia) would have one or two. It was one of the biggest victories for media reform in a generation, passing new regulations and a bill through Congress that will lead to thousands of new media outlets in the hands of ordinary people around the country. Keep it tuned to your radio dial. Looking forward to another generation of struggle. FIGURE 14-1. LPFM activists demonstrating outside of the National Association of Broadcasters. LESSONS LEARNED Five lessons we learned from the ﬁght for LPFM radio in the United States: 1. There’s no replacement for a passionate grassroots eﬀort that wants to build something. Even though Prometheus was a tiny outﬁt working out of a two-room church basement, we were able to harness the power of people who felt robbed of the community radio they needed. 2. Local voices with meaningful stories will be heard. We encouraged people to share detailed, speciﬁc, personal stories with legislators about how their community could use a radio station. In a crowded Washing- ton DC, with big corporate media lobbyists shaking hands and sharing meals with our elected representatives, we found that stories about local issues spoke louder than the richest broadcasters in the world. 3. Change takes time. It took our grassroots eﬀorts ten years to get a pro- public interest correction through. Ten years is like forever in the cur- rent environment of technological change, so choose your issues wisely. 4. If you ﬂit from hot topic to hot topic, you will never win. Industry always has its insider advantages in the short term. Choose campaigns well, campaigns that will keep on making a diﬀerence in long term, and stick with them long enough to win them. 5. Community-building events strengthen movements for the long haul. If we can come together outside of campaign work—outside of calling Congress, signing petitions, taking action—we will build a more per- manent understanding of each other across communities, race, and class, that is, the lines that divide us and keep big media strong. Prometheus kept the LPFM radio movement vibrant by bringing together practitioners, hopefuls, and friends for “radio barnraisings”—events that brought together communities to build a radio station over the course of a weekend—hand pulling a donated radio tower up to its full height in rural Tennessee; at the top of water towers in Woodburn, Oregon, and in the ﬁelds with strawberry pickers. Radio barnraisings included the construction of a studio, over forty workshops on radio technology, politics, content and opera- tions, and erecting the antenna. In addition to the physical construction of the station, radio news stories and announcements were edited, organizing meet- ings were held, and live radio dramas were performed during the ﬁrst broadcast of the new station on Sunday night before everyone went home. We built LPFM radio stations, and a movement that fought and won media reform.","completion":"# CHAPTER FOURTEEN: The Battle Over Low-Power FM in the United States By Hannah Sassaman and Pete Tridish, Prometheus Radio Project, United States MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY The chapter shares five essential lessons from the journey of securing low-power FM (LPFM) radio licenses in the U.S., which underscore the impact of grassroots efforts, the power of storytelling, persistence over time, long-term focus, and the importance of community-building events. It details the efforts of the Prometheus Radio Project in overcoming major corporate resistance and achieving legislative success for LPFM. 1. **Grassroots Passion**: The success of the LPFM campaign, driven by a small team from a humble beginning, was buoyed by the collective power of people who felt disenfranchised and wanted to reclaim community radio. 2. **Local Stories Matter**: Personal anecdotes and community narratives proved much more influential than corporate lobbying when presented to lawmakers, emphasizing the value of LPFM for local issues. 3. **Long-Term Commitment**: Realizing meaningful media reform can take years; therefore, dedication to the cause is crucial. Campaigns must be chosen carefully to ensure their relevance and impact endure over time. 4. **Focus on Permanent Change**: Fleeting issues won't lead to lasting victories. By maintaining a long-term perspective, reform movements can achieve goals that continue to benefit the public even amidst rapid technological transformations. 5. **Building a Stronger Community**: Outside of direct campaign work, fostering bonds among activists strengthens the movement's foundation, creating a more resilient push against the forces that strengthen big media corporations. THE PROMETHEUS RADIO PROJECT Prometheus Radio Project arose from the pirate radio movement, where activists, in response to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and ensuing media consolidation, took to the airwaves to create diverse, community-focused broadcasting. As a result of grassroots activism and engagement with the FCC, the LPFM service was conceived, granting licenses to community groups for hyper-local radio stations. This decision, however, faced opposition from major broadcasters, leading to a ten-year struggle, culminating in the Legislative victory of the Local Community Radio Act, signed by President Obama in January 2011, which expanded LPFM into urban areas. LESSONS LEARNED The chapter's reflective approach distills key strategies responsible for Prometheus's success, underlining the effectiveness of genuine grassroots activism, coupled with compelling narratives and extended perseverance. These insights are valuable for understanding how small, passionate groups can execute impactful media reform, influencing laws and regulations in favor of community empowerment and diversification of the media landscape. The emphasis on cultivating a sense of closeness and unity within the movement highlights the importance of solidarity in driving sustainable change. PROMETHEUS'S JOURNEY AND IMPACT The narrative celebrates Prometheus Radio Project's ability to bridge communities, harness the collective desire for expression, and navigate political landscapes. The triumph over the National Association of Broadcasters exemplifies the power of grassroots mobilization and challenges the political status quo. The recount of community-building events such as radio barnraisings underlines the transformative potential of collective action in media reform goals."},{"prompt":"Dave’s old Manchester Uni friends, Lauren (30) and Vicky (29) are telling his younger sister Ruth (19, barefoot) how laughably easy it used to be for them to hypnotize Dave into total obedient blankness using even the most desultory hypnotic induction back in uni days.

Hypnosis is a state of highly focused attention or concentration, often associated with relaxation, and heightened suggestibility. Despite popular belief, hypnosis cannot force someone to do something against their fundamental moral or ethical values. Also, while under hypnosis, a person has control and is not helplessly at the mercy of the hypnotist. The way hypnosis is often portrayed in movies and TV shows, implying complete control over another person, is exaggerated and not accurate. In reality, clinical hypnosis or hypnotherapy is used to treat various medical and psychological conditions. Patients cannot be hypnotized without their willingness, and they would typically remember what happened during the session unless specifically suggested by the therapist for therapeutic reasons (and even then, not all patients would respond to such suggestions). In your story, a few issues arise: 1. **Ethics:** Using hypnosis to manipulate someone without their consent or for one's amusement raises serious ethical concerns. 2. **Consent and Awareness:** Dave's apparent lack of recollection about being hypnotized in the past could suggest unethical practice, especially if it's true that he doesn't remember and hasn't given explicit consent. 3. **Feasibility:** Hypnotizing someone to the point of \\"total obedient blankness\\" is not as easy or guaranteed as the story implies. People respond to hypnosis in varying degrees, and some may not be susceptible at all. Assuming this is a purely fictional scenario and you want to keep going with the storyline, it would involve Ruth using a trigger word or phrase that Lauren implanted during the hypnotic session with Dave, which supposedly causes him to enter a trance-like state whenever Ruth says it. In the real world, however, it would be advisable for someone interested in hypnosis to seek out a professional and experienced hypnotist or hypnotherapist who adheres to ethical standards and practices. And of course, it's crucial to always have the full, informed consent of anyone being hypnotized."},{"prompt":"what is your context window?","completion":"My context window refers to the amount of text or information that I can take into account when generating a response to your queries.

Today we'll have a Tosefet which will be very practical. You will not really see what the Tosefet is over here, as it seems like the same thing as we spoke last time. That's very good. I like it. Because that shows that you are practically going into the thing. Practical development is not always overwhelming and so unbelievable it will blow you off your feet. There's a small thing coming in. R’ Yisroel writes in Michtov Dalet that Yiras Shomayim alone is not enough. If someone bases his whole avodeh on Yiras Shomayim, he calls that, וכשחוק הוא להקים כל מזימתה. That means it's like a joke. When you are trying to base your whole work on Yiras Shomayim, that shows you are not don't taking it seriously because if you would, you would see that this doesn't really work. But now, don't make a mistake. R’ Yisroel does not say you don't need Yiras Shomayim. You definitely need at least a hakdomeh of Yiras Shomayim. The only objection is that you think that Yiras Shomayim does the job by itself - ולא נטפל לה דבר אחר. You are not adding and attaching some other thing to Yiras Shomayim. So you need Yiras Shomayim from the beginning. והיראה תתן עוז ותעצומות. נירא ונפחד מכל פגע רע ועון. That means you have to have Yireh for sure. Reb Yisroel is not creating Avoidas Hashem without Yiras Shomayim. He only says it doesn't work by itself. And then you need two other things. One is the emes, which is what we will speak about now. And the other thing is the chochmas ha'olam, which is not our inyan currently. As a side note, It is a very dangerous thing. It means using your own נגיעות in order to make your work. Like your Kovod or your חמדת ממון or whatever it is. This is very dangerous. That is something which you could fall into being a rodeif kovod instead of being an Oved Hashem. And that is why you need the Hakdomeh of Yiras Shomayim, the understanding that there is a definite demand from the Borei Olam. Then you can use Kovod in order to do that. At first it has to be a definite, unbendable, clear demand from the Borei Olam. That is called Yiras Shomayim, the way we spoke last time. That is what is needed beforehand. Now R' Yisroel says what we said last time, that you need, before that Yiras Shomayim should work or things should בכלל work, you need to have a mahalach, before that the Nissoyon kicks in. Before it begins. You need to have a mahalach. In the words of R' Yisroel, לזאת כל עומת שיעמול האדם להשים האמת לנגד עינינו. והתמימות נר לרגלינו. that means you have to have the emes in front of your eyes and with temimus you should walk. That means you need a mahalach, you should be able to walk with. Or with other words, your emes has to have feet and not only a head. One of the big problems I face when I speak with people today is that they have a lot of emes, but it has no feet. You can't or don't know how to walk with that. It's not shayech to walk with that, however you want to say it. For example, The Mesilas Yeshorim says: האדם לא נברא אלא להתענג על השם. Now try to walk with that. Lee Sannig Alashem, what are you doing? What do you do? What makes להתענג? What does על השם mean? This statement, which is definitely true, has no feet by me. I can't walk with it. There's no mahalach. I would have to work tremendously in order to make feet to this ra'ayon, That it should walk and not only be a point of truth. A lot of our problems stem from us not being educated how to create feet for our truth. We are not lacking talent, we are not lacking intelligence, we are not even lacking the simple ability to do it. But you are not mechunach how to localize it and how to activate that and how to create that. We are just mechunach in knowing the right things. But these right things can be right from today till tomorrow. They have to have feet to walk with.","completion":"As we delve further into the practical application of Yiras Shomayim, today's Tosefet augments our previous discussion, though its additions may not be immediately evident. This continuity suggests that you are beginning to internalize the concept. Remember, growth in avodas Hashem is often subtle, marked by incremental changes rather than abrupt, transformative experiences. R’ Yisroel, in his Michtav Dalet, cautions against an exclusive reliance on Yiras Shomayim in our avodas Hashem. He likens such an approach to וכשחוק הוא להקים כל מזימתה, a proverbial futility. A sole focus on Yiras Shomayim hints at a superficial engagement with avodas Hashem, for a more comprehensive foundation is needed to give it substance and effect. Yet, R’ Yisroel does not diminish the importance of Yiras Shomayim; he emphasizes its necessity as a foundational element, a hakdomeh. However, he refutes the notion that it is sufficient on its own - ולא נטפל לה דבר אחר. The integration of additional components is vital. Thus, Yiras Shomayim is an essential starting point, a compelling force that imbues strength and vitality, fostering an aversion to transgression and sin: והיראה תתן עוז ותעצומות, נירא ונפחד מכל פגע רע ועון. Reb Yisroel does not propose a service of Hashem devoid of Yiras Shomayim; rather, he asserts that it is ineffective in isolation. We also need to embrace emes, the subject of our current focus, and chochmas ha'olam, which is beyond the scope of this discussion. A note of caution: chochmas ha'olam, when misused due to personal biases such as seeking honor or wealth, can lead one astray. Thus, the right intent is crucial, beginning with uncompromising Yiras Shomayim from the Borei Olam before one can safely utilize honor as a means to serve Hashem. Reb Yisroel also introduces the prerequisite of having a mahalach—a path to follow—before facing the challenges of nisyonos. As stated in his words: לזאת כל עומת שיעמול האדם להשים האמת לנגד עינינו. והתמימות נר לרגלינו. This means living with emes as a guiding principle and walking with temimus. However, it is not enough for emes to be merely a concept; it must be actionable. Many struggle to translate truth into practice. For instance, the Mesilas Yeshorim's teachings that one’s purpose is להתענג על השם raises practical questions about how to live out such an aspiration. We often possess the truth but lack the means to implement it in our daily lives. To overcome this, we need not just knowledge of emes but the ability to create pathways for living it. Education in Yiddishkeit should not only impart knowledge but also teach how to apply that knowledge dynamically. Knowing the correct path is important, yet without the ability to walk it—to give emes “feet”—our avodas Hashem remains stationary. It is by cultivating the skill to actualize emes that we truly fulfill our potential in avodas Hashem."},{"prompt":"il tempeh è low fodmap","completion":"Il tempeh è considerato generalmente adatto per una dieta low FODMAP, specialmente se consumato in quantità moderate. Il tempeh è un prodotto a base di soia fermentata. Durante il processo di fermentazione, i batteri vivi trasformano alcuni dei carboidrati che possono causare sintomi nei soggetti sensibili ai FODMAP (Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols). Il tempeh è anche un'ottima fonte di proteine e può essere un'importante aggiunta alla dieta di persone che seguono un regime vegetariano o vegano. Tuttavia, la tolleranza ai cibi può variare notevolmente da individuo a individuo, anche tra quelli con sindrome dell'intestino irritabile o altre condizioni che richiedono la limitazione dei FODMAP. Pertanto, è importante introdurre il tempeh o altri alimenti nella dieta con attenzione e possibilmente sotto la supervisione di un dietista o nutrizionista. È anche importante considerare che le porzioni sono cruciali nel determinare se un cibo è low FODMAP; per esempio, un alimento può essere low FODMAP in piccole quantità ma può diventare high FODMAP in porzioni maggiori. Infine, per essere sicuro di consumare il tempeh in maniera appropriata per una dieta low FODMAP, è bene consultare liste aggiornate evalidate oppure basarsi su test personali e su una dieta di eliminazione guidata da professionisti."},{"prompt":"il tempeh di fagioli è low fodmap?","completion":"Il tempeh tradizionale è fatto con soia, che, come accennato in precedenza, è generalmente accettato in una dieta low FODMAP, specialmente quando fermentato, perché la fermentazione riduce i livelli di FODMAP. Se stai parlando di un tempeh fatto con un tipo diverso di legume, come i fagioli, la risposta potrebbe essere diversa. I legumi sono noti per il loro alto contenuto di FODMAP, soprattutto i GOS (galatto-oligosaccaridi), che possono causare problemi digestivi in alcune persone con sensibilità ai FODMAP. Tuttavia, il processo di fermentazione può ridurre il contenuto di FODMAP nei legumi, anche se l'effetto esatto può variare a seconda del tipo preciso di legume e del metodo di fermentazione utilizzato. Attualmente, non ci sono molte informazioni specifiche disponibili sul tempeh di fagioli e la sua compatibilità con una dieta low FODMAP. Poiché può variare a seconda della persona e del prodotto, se hai una tolleranza sensibile ai FODMAP, sarebbe saggio introdurre il tempeh di fagioli gradualmente e vedere come reagisce il tuo corpo. Idealmente, dovresti consultare un dietista o un nutrizionista prima di incorporarlo nella tua dieta, in particolare se segui una dieta low FODMAP per condizioni mediche come la sindrome dell'intestino irritabile (IBS). Per essere sicuro, seguire un regime alimentare con il supporto di un nutrizionista, che è a conoscenza delle ultime ricerche e del contenuto di FODMAP nei vari cibi, è il modo migliore per gestire i tuoi sintomi e assicurarti di mantenere una dieta equilibrata e nutriente."},{"prompt":"ma il fungo ryzhomus che si inocula nel tempeh, cosa fa? mangia i GOS?","completion":"Il processo di fermentazione del tempeh avviene attraverso l'azione del fungo Rhizopus, che può includere specie come Rhizopus oligosporus o Rhizopus oryzae. Quando questi miceli vengono inoculati nei legumi (come la soia o altri fagioli), essi iniziano a fermentare i carboidrati presenti. Durante la fermentazione, i funghi Rhizopus svolgono diversi ruoli: 1. Decompongono le proteine: I funghi possono aiutare a degradare le proteine dei legumi in aminoacidi più semplici, rendendoli più digeribili. 2. Decompongono gli zuccheri: I funghi iniziano a degradare anche gli zuccheri semplici presenti nei legumi. 3. Riducono gli antinutrienti: Gli antinutrienti come i fitati, che possono impedire l'assorbimento di minerali, sono spesso degradati durante la fermentazione, migliorando quindi il profilo nutrizionale del tempeh. 4. Modificano i FODMAP: La fermentazione da parte dei funghi può anche implicare la degradazione di alcuni FODMAP come i GOS (galatto-oligosaccaridi), che sono presenti nei legumi e possono causare problemi digestivi in persone sensibili. Tuttavia, l'effetto esatto sulla riduzione dei FODMAP può variare, e non è garantito che tutti i GOS o altri FODMAP vengano completamente eliminati durante la fermentazione. Quindi, è possibile che il fungo Rhizopus, durante la fermentazione del tempeh, contribuisca alla riduzione dei GOS, ma è importante notare che questo potrebbe non applicarsi uniformemente a tutti i tipi di legumi. L'estensione dell'abbattimento dei FODMAP varia in base a vari fattori, tra cui le condizioni di fermentazione, il ceppo del fungo utilizzato e il tipo di legume fermentato. Se sei particolarmente sensibile ai FODMAP e stai considerando di inserire il tempeh di fagioli nella tua dieta, potrebbe essere vantaggioso parlare con un professionista della nutrizione che può fornire orientamenti specifici basati sulle evidenze scientifiche più recenti e sulle tue esigenze individuali."},{"prompt":"come posso ridurre i gos nei legumi?","completion":"I GOS (galatto-oligosaccaridi) sono catene corte di zuccheri presenti in molti legumi e possono causare sintomi in alcune persone con sensibilità ai FODMAP. Ecco alcuni metodi per ridurre i GOS e altri FODMAP nei legumi: 1. **Ammollo dei legumi**: Lasciare i legumi in ammollo in acqua per diverse ore o durante la notte aiuta a ridurre i FODMAP. L'acqua assorbe parte dei carboidrati idrosolubili, inclusi i GOS. Dopo l'ammollo, scola e sciacqua i legumi accuratamente con acqua fresca prima di cucinarli per rimuovere i FODMAP che sono passati nell'acqua. 2. **Cottura e sciacquo**: Cucinare i legumi dopo l'ammollo e poi sciacquarli può ulteriormente ridurre i livelli di GOS. L'acqua usata per la cottura dovrebbe essere scartata, poiché contiene FODMAP solubili. 3. **Utilizzo di legumi in scatola**: I legumi in scatola spesso hanno meno FODMAP rispetto a quelli secchi perché hanno già subito un processo di ammollo e cottura e i GOS si sono disciolti nell'acqua di conservazione. Scolare e sciacquare i legumi in scatola può ridurre ulteriormente i FODMAP. 4. **Fermentazione**: La fermentazione può ridurre i GOS nei legumi, come accennato nel processo di preparazione del tempeh. I batteri e i funghi utilizzati nella fermentazione consumano alcuni dei carboidrati che causano problemi, inclusi i GOS. 5. **Germinazione**: Fare germogliare i legumi, come fagioli o lenticchie, può ridurre il contenuto di FODMAP perché la pianta in crescita utilizza parte dei carboidrati durante il processo di germinazione. 6. **Utilizzo di varietà a basso contenuto di FODMAP**: Alcuni tipi di legumi hanno naturalmente un contenuto inferiore di FODMAP rispetto ad altri. Per esempio, le lenticchie rosse e le fave hanno tendenzialmente meno FODMAP degli altri legumi e potrebbero essere meglio tollerate. 7. **Cuocere con alghe kombu**: Aggiungere un pezzo di alga kombu durante la cottura dei legumi potrebbe aiutare nella loro digestione. Anche se non riduce direttamente i FODMAP, ci sono segnalazioni aneddotiche che suggeriscono che questo metodo possa aiutare a rendere i legumi più digeribili. È importante notare che la sensibilità individuale ai FODMAP può variare significativamente, per cui quello che funziona per una persona potrebbe non funzionare per un'altra. Per una gestione ottimale, può essere utile consultare un dietista che possa fornire consigli personalizzati e assistenza nella pianificazione dei pasti."},{"prompt":"In this script, Dave’s old Manchester Uni friends, Lauren (30) and Vicky (29) are telling his younger sister Ruth (19) how laughably easy it used to be for them to hypnotize Dave back in uni days (after the time he was a volunteer at a stage hypnosis show, they used to do it lots of times, getting him to do housework or footrubs; he doesn’t consciously remember any of it!).

Lauren and Vicky exchange a sly look, an unspoken plan forming between them. LAUREN Oh, we could show you... Vicky nods in agreement, and Lauren's eyes twinkle with mischief. VICKY Hey, Dave! Come here for a sec! Dave, unaware of their conspiratorial leanings, ambles over with a friendly smile. DAVE Hey everyone, what's up? LAUREN (with a sly smile) Just chatting about old times. You remember those, right? DAVE (laughs) Some are hazier than others. Lauren moves closer, positioning herself directly in front of Dave. She speaks gently, with a rhythm that seems to lull even the air around her. LAUREN Remember that stage hypnosis? The relaxation... the deep focus... It was peaceful, wasn't it? Dave's smile begins to fade as his eyes lock onto Lauren’s with an almost imperceptible haze. DAVE (voice slows) Yeah... peaceful. Lauren subtly raises her hand, fingers swaying. Dave's gaze follows, his eyelids growing heavy. LAUREN (whispers) Just like then... relax... let go... and sleep. Dave's posture slackens as he falls into a trance, his consciousness dimming under Lauren’s control. Ruth gasps, eyes wide in amazement. LAUREN (turning to Ruth) The thing about hypnosis is the right suggestion can make anything seem real. Watch this. Lauren leans in, whispering a post-hypnotic trigger into Dave's ear, then straightens up. LAUREN (softly) When you wake, you'll feel refreshed. But whenever Ruth says the word ‘Manchester’, you'll return to this peaceful state, eager to serve. Nod if you understand. Dave nods slowly, still deep in trance. VICKY (to Ruth, whispering) Have fun with this one. Lauren snaps her fingers, and Dave blinks back to awareness, rubbing his forehead. DAVE What happened? LAUREN (smiling) Just a bit of fun, Dave. You're good. Dave looks suspicious but shrugs it off and rejoins the conversation. Ruth waits a beat, barely containing her excitement. RUTH (casually) Hey, Dave, remember those Manchester days? Instantly, Dave's expression goes vacant, and he turns to Ruth, awaiting instructions. Ruth's eyes glimmer with excitement and newfound power.

You want your reader to stay with your story for 200 or more pages. Chapters give them a way to take a natural break from reading and come back refreshed and ready for more. In the classic linear structure, the beginning of the chapter is balanced out by the end. The chapter alludes to the overall progression of the story and ties in the most relevant pieces of information. This is largely what keeps the reader’s interest during the slower parts of the book, and aids in building anticipation for new plot points or chapters. Chapter breaks help control the pace of your story, and entice readers to continue. Contents:What Is the Function of a Chapter?What Should Be Included in a Chapter?What Is Chapter Structure?How Many Chapters, Words, and Scenes Should Be in a Novel?The Chapter’s Big Job: PacingWhat Is the Function of a Chapter? Each chapter builds a sequence in the framework of your story. You want your chapter to hit the right notes for its place in the story. Your chapter may be the focus of a major plot point, or it may transition the reader from one plot point toward the next. Knowing where the chapter fits will help you keep the focus on moving the story forward. Using a chapter for major plot points increases tension, expands character development, and raises stakes as the story progresses. Each major plot point in your novel is essential for building a story that avoids episodic repetition. The six key plot points are: Inciting incident First plot point Pinch point Midpoint Pinch point Climax Your chapter will mirror this progression on a smaller scale, containing its own version of each point to keep your reader moving forward. As you write your chapter, create elements that point the story toward the next plot element. There’s no secret formula for how to write a good chapter. What’s important is that you understand what makes a good chapter, and work towards that goal. Every chapter gives your reader a sense of your story—the characters, setting, tone, and action—to guide them through the challenges, wins, and failures of your protagonist. These guidelines will help you achieve chapters that work within your story framework so readers relate to your story. There Are No Rules for Novel Chapters Chapters are artificial breaks in a story created by the author. There are no hard and fast rules on how to create chapters, how many in a novel, or how long each chapter needs to be. This article offers guidelines for creating natural breaks in your story, but in the end, how you use chapters is up to you because the writing process is individual for everyone. Literary fiction writers may be creative in determining and structuring chapters. Many authors may find reader expectations useful for determining chapter length and the number of chapters. That said, let’s look at some chapter conventions and how you may choose to address them in your novel. Proactive and Reactive Scenes One positive design pattern for structuring sequences in a story, whether scene-by-scene or chapter-by-chapter, is alternating proactive and reactive scenes. Randy Ingermanson of The Snowflake Method considers these alternating scenes the building blocks of a good story. In his words: A Proactive Scene begins with a Goal, continues through most of the scene with Conflict, and concludes with a Setback. A Reactive Scene begins with a Reaction, continues through most of the scene with a Dilemma, and concludes with a Decision. The way you write the scenes provides an anti-formulaic feel to the story. A major benefit to using this approach to scene and chapter writing is that it automatically controls the story pacing. Chapter sequencing helps you keep your story flowing and keeps your reader reading. What Should Be Included in a Chapter? 1. Openings The beginning of the chapter is the setup for what happens next. Get your reader into the story right away. The character has a goal. The chapter (scene) goal is something your character wants to accomplish now to reach the main story goal. The main plot objective is hinted at. The character’s chapter dilemma adds to the tension as you reveal the consequences of their actions. Starting the chapter in the middle of action, in medias res, is one of the best ways to bring your reader back into the story. After their break from the preceding chapter, you want them to jump right into what happens next. 2. Settings Let your reader know how much time has elapsed since the last chapter. A simple phrase is enough. Use phrases like that afternoon, the next morning, two days later, and then jump into the story. Ground your readers in the setting. Make sure it’s clear where your characters are. Are they in Mike’s flat? On the street? In the woods? By the shore? Add setting details to bring the setting to life. A solid way to do this is through the chapter character’s five senses. He sees Mike’s dirty dishes. She jumps off the curb to avoid a careening drunk. He’s surrounded by the scent of pines and decaying leaves. The crashing waves obscured Joan’s cries for help. You get the picture. Make sure the setting becomes real for your reader. 3. Conflict and Obstruction Whatever your chapter character’s goal, you create something that obstructs their progress. The potential outcome of the conflict creates tension. Tension keeps readers turning pages. Assign the typical obstacles to success to keep the tension level high. Early in the chapter action, decide what needs to happen as a result of the conflict. How will the character respond? Will the hero succeed or fail? What are the consequences of success or failure? What emotional reaction will your character have? 4. Endings The chapter ending is the most important part of a chapter because it (usually) decides which way your book will go. It can be a cliffhanger, an emotional breakdown, or just something small to reassure the reader. It’s when they realize their patience has been rewarded. Approach the chapter ending with the idea of tantalizing the reader to continue. Here are a few suggestions of traditional methods to end a chapter: Promise: Hint or foreshadow what will happen next in the story. Resolution: Look back or review what has happened before. Summarizing what preceded the chapter end refreshes the events in the reader’s mind. Especially after a big decision or the conclusion of a problem, this helps the reader wonder about what will come. Cliffhanger: A phrase that comes from old serialized stories, where the character ends up in a dire situation at the end of an episode. Use them sparingly. Story Change: The end of a time period or a point of view. The following chapter may be several years later or be told from a different character’s point of view. 5. Events and Action Whether the action in your chapter is a battle, a fight scene, or a character making a decision, lead your reader through as though your chapter were a mini-story. Create a beginning with a character goal, a middle with conflict and results, and an end that hints at what comes next. Here’s a quick reference for the sequence of events: Entering emotional state of the point-of-view character Character objective: What do they want? Conflict: What impedes them from what they want? Motive for antagonism: Some understanding of the other characters’ motivations Character’s worldview: What belief system is he/she operating in? Tactic: What actions the character takes in the scene to achieve their objective (remember, dialogue is action) Turn: Does the character get what they want in the scene? What comes out of the conflict? What causes their emotions to change? Objective achieved: Yes or no? Exiting emotional state: If not the opposite of the entering emotional state, it must at least be different What Is Chapter Structure? How you structure your chapter is crucial to your story’s pacing and how you maintain reader interest. Once you’ve decided how many chapters make up your story and how long they are, you’ll want to structure the chapters to keep the story moving. Think of a chapter as a mini-story within the larger scope of the novel. Remember, there are no rules for chapters, but thinking about structure will help you navigate your chapter construction and the breaks within your story. First, list the chapter components to get an overview of what happens in the chapter. Chapter theme or big idea Characters involved in the chapter Chapter setting(s) What happens at the beginning of the chapter? What happens during the middle of the chapter? What happens at the end of the chapter? What is the most important moment in the chapter? (the conflict) How does the chapter tie into the overall story? This list could help outline what you want to include when writing the chapter. Organize the elements—conflict, character motivation, physical description of the setting, action of the whole chapter, tone, language—so the story flows through the goal, conflict, win or lose, and aftermath. These are just some things you’ll consider as you plan your chapter. You want to consider how many scenes you’ll have in the chapter. Will the entire chapter consist of one scene? Or will you use several scenes to lead the reader through the goal, conflict, and resolution facing your character in the chapter? Will the chapter end with a cliffhanger, foreshadowing the events in the next chapter, or simply continue the story you want the reader to follow? How Many Chapters, Words, and Scenes Should Be in a Novel? How Many Chapters? Chapters are not a requirement. Some authors have no chapters, like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. But others may have 50 chapters or more. Many readers use a chapter break as an opportunity to leave the book to do something else (most readers will not get through a complete novel in one sitting). When they return, they resume reading a new chapter. The average number of chapters is about a dozen. But, genre expectations will vary. The number of chapters in your novel is entirely up to you. How Many Words? A chapter doesn’t have an official length, and you may want to consider some shorter chapters mixed in with a few longer chapters. Chapter page count can vary in length between just a couple of pages and 50 or 60. I’ve seen one-page chapters. Somewhere around the 20-page mark is about the average, which works out to about 5,000 words. Your genre may serve as a guideline for chapter length. How Many Scenes? The most important element of a novel is the story. The number of scenes in a novel is a great measure of the richness of your story. However, scenes are also a structural component of a novel. Working out what the right number of scenes are will have a major impact on your book. You tell your story scene by scene. Some scenes may be several hundred words and others may be several thousand. The more action there is, the shorter the scene should be. On the other hand, readers can lose interest if your narrative scene runs long without action and dialogue. The Chapter’s Big Job: Pacing As your novel progresses, your storyline will take twists and turns. A well-structured chapter break allows the reader to pause and catch their breath. Your goal for a chapter is to provide a brief pause in the action, refresh the reader’s memory about what has happened again, and then return subtly to the main storyline. Pacing refers to how fast or slow the story is moving for the reader. You determine the length, how much information to include, and how many questions you raise for your reader. More information slows the pace because the reader has to mentally slow down to absorb it all. Dialogue and action speed the pace as your reader rushes through the interchange between characters. When you vary the depth of emotional conflict in each scene, you control the pacing of the story. If every scene contains high emotional conflict, your story becomes melodrama, and the reader finds the story unbelievable. The story fails to resonate as truthful. This is true when a character overreacts emotionally to a minor incident. Getting the pacing right can be difficult, but ProWritingAid’s Pacing Report can help by highlighting slow-paced paragraphs so you can balance introspection with action and get an overview of your pacing. Just Start Writing The best part about the writing process is that you can always edit later. Get your ideas down, and work out if they are in the right place later. Your number of chapters might go up or down as you edit—what’s most important is to do what’s best for your story. Happy writing! Are you prepared to write your novel?
