Let's assume the opposite of what we want to prove, namely, that n+1 is a composite number. 1. Assume ( n+1 ) is a composite number. - By definition, a composite number has at least one prime factor other than 1 and itself. 2. Let ( p ) be a prime factor of ( n+1 ). This means ( p leq n ) because if ( p ) were greater than ( n ), then ( p ) cannot be a factor of a number that is at most ( n+1 ) and thus violating the property of ( p ) being a factor of ( n+1 ). 3. Since ( p leq n ), ( p ) must be a divisor of ( n! ), because ( n! ) is the product of all positive integers up to ( n ). Hence, we have: [ n! equiv 0 pmod{p} ] 4. Now, consider ( n! + 1 ). For ( n! + 1 ) to be divisible by ( n+1 ), it should also be divisible by ( p ). However, since ( n! equiv 0 pmod{p} ), it follows that: [ n! + 1 equiv 1 pmod{p} ] This means ( n! + 1 equiv 1 pmod{p} ), so ( n! + 1 ) cannot be divisible by ( p ). 5.

Since these sequences are nondecreasing for any ( x ), it implies that for any ( m > n ), we have: [ f(mx) geq f(nx) ] In particular, for ( x = 1 ), this means: [ f(m) geq f(n) quad text{for all} quad m > n ] This shows that ( f ) is nondecreasing on the set of natural numbers ( mathbb{N} ). 4. **Step 2**: Extend this property to rational numbers.

Pick an arbitrarily large (N) such that (a_N) is composite (this is possible since we can't have three consecutive primes in the sequence). Let (p) be a prime divisor of (a_N). Consider the number (frac{2a_N}{p}). It is clear that (frac{2a_N}{p} < a_N) and (gcd(a_{N+1}, frac{2a_N}{p}) = gcd(a_{N+1}, a_N) = 1). If (frac{2a_N}{p} ne a_i) for all (i le K), then (a_{N+2}) must be equal to some odd number that is less than (frac{2a_N}{p} < a_N). Note that this is only true when (a_N) is composite. Similarly, we find (a_N > a_{N+2} > a_{N+4} > cdots > a_{N+2i} = p) for some (p). Such (p) must exist since there are finite odd numbers less than (a_N). We can actually pick (N) so that (2p ne a_i) for all (i le K). Now, note that (p mid a_{N+2i+2}) and so (2p ne a_{N+2i+2}). This can only happen when (2 mid a_{N+2i+1}), a contradiction to the assumption. Otherwise, if (2 nmid a_{N+2i+1}), we will get a contradiction to the smallest value possible of (a_{N+2i+2}). Thus, there are infinite even numbers in the sequence. (blacksquare) 2. **Claim 2: Each natural number occurs exactly once in this sequence.** **Proof:** We prove by induction that each number occurs in the sequence. Suppose that (1, 2, cdots, t-1) appear in the sequence in the following order (a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, cdots, a_{b_{t-1}}) where (b_i < b_{i+1}) with (1 le i le t-2). We will prove that (t) is in the sequence. Assume not. *Case 1:* If there exists (a_k > t) such that (k > b_{t-1}) and (gcd(a_k, t) > 1), then we must have (gcd(a_{k+1}, t) > 1), otherwise (a_{k+2} = t), the smallest number possible, a contradiction. Similarly, we find (gcd(a_l, t) > 1) for all (l > k). Now, we pick a prime (p > t). Suppose that there are (h) numbers less than (pt) and only receive prime divisors different from (p), occurring in this sequence. Pick (a_m < pt) as one of such numbers where (m) is maximal. We will prove that there exists a prime (p > a_k) in this sequence to give a contradiction in (gcd(a_l, t) > 1) for all (l > k). Indeed, if (p) occurs before (a_m), then we are done. If not, consider (a_{m+2}). We follow (a_{m+2} = dp) where (d ne 1) is the least divisor of (t), otherwise if (a_{m+2} < dp), then all prime divisors of (a_{m+2} < pt) are different from (p), a contradiction to the maximum of (m). Thus, (dp = a_{m+2}) is in this sequence, which follows (a_{m+4} = p), a contradiction since (gcd(a_{m+4}, t) > 1). Thus, we can't have (gcd(a_l, t) > 1) for all (l > k), which means (t) is in this sequence. *Case 2:* If for all (a_k > t) and (k > b_{t-1}), then (gcd(a_k, t) = 1). If (t) is even, then from **Claim 1** we have a contradiction. Thus, (t) is odd. Assume that all (h) numbers less than (2t) and relatively prime to (t) have been listed in the sequence. We pick an *even* number that occurs after those (h) numbers, call it (a_m). It is obvious that (gcd(a_{m+1}, 2t) = 1) and (a_{m+2} ge 2t). This follows (a_{m+2} = 2t), a contradiction since (gcd(a_{m+2}, t) = t). Thus, this case can't happen. Thus, in all cases, (t) is in the sequence.

Now, let's consider the worst-case scenario for the number of people who did not join any club, which would be when the members of clubs S and Z overlap as much as possible (since we want to maximize the number of people not in any club). The maximum overlap would occur if all members of club Z also joined club S. This would mean that there are 11 people who are in both clubs S and Z.

To maximize f'(x) + a, we need to consider the minimum value of -a + frac{ln x - 1}{(ln x)^2}, which occurs at x=e^2 and results in f'_{max}(x) + a = frac{1}{4}. We need to check if f_{min}(x) leq frac{1}{4} for x in [e, e^2]. Case ①: If a geq frac{1}{4}, from part (2), we know f(x) is decreasing on [e, e^2].

Case ②: If a < frac{1}{4}, the range of f'(x) on [e, e^2] is [-a, frac{1}{4} - a].

So, if sin B corresponds to an acute angle, then a second solution corresponding to an obtuse angle can exist if B is less than 90^circ. D: a = 7, b = 5, A = 80^circ. We use the Law of Sines to find angle B. For a given sin B, there can be two different angles B and 180^circ - B. Since angle A is already large (80^circ), angle B must be small and therefore less than 90^circ. It implies that 180^circ - B > 90^circ, and hence there can be an obtuse angle solution for B; leading to two solutions for the triangle.

Given: A convex n-gon where all angles are obtuse. We need to prove that the sum of the lengths of the diagonals in it is greater than the sum of the lengths of its sides. 2. First, note that since all angles in the n-gon are obtuse, it implies that: [ n geq 5 ] This is because a convex polygon with less than 5 sides cannot have all its angles being obtuse. 3. Consider diagonals that connect vertices of the n-gon by skipping one vertex (i.e., join vertices A_i to A_{i+2}). By connecting these vertices, we form an n-star polygon, such that: [ A_iA_{i+2} quad forall i in {1, 2, ldots, n} ] 4.

(blacksquare) Problem: For what values of (m) does the quadratic trinomial ( mx^2 + (m-1)x + (m-1) ) take only negative values? Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Condition for the Quadratic to Be Always Negative**: For the quadratic ( mx^2 + (m-1)x + (m-1) ) to always take negative values, the following conditions must be met: [ begin{aligned} 1. & quad m < 0 2. & quad text{The discriminant must be negative:} & quad D = (m-1)^2 - 4m(m-1). end{aligned} ] 2. **Calculate the Discriminant**: Expand and simplify the discriminant: [ begin{aligned} D &= (m-1)^2 - 4m(m-1) &= m^2 - 2m + 1 - 4m^2 + 4m &= -3m^2 + 2m + 1. end{aligned} ] 3. **Finding (m) for the Discriminant**: To ensure the quadratic trinomial takes only negative values, solve the inequality: [ -3m^2 + 2m + 1 < 0. ] 4. **Solving the Quadratic Inequality**: The roots of the quadratic equation (-3m^2 + 2m + 1 = 0) can be found using the quadratic formula: [ m = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, ] where ( a = -3 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = 1 ).

Therefore: [ a x_0^n + b x_0^{n-1} + dots + k x_0 + l = 0. ] 3. **Rewriting the Equation**: The polynomial can be rewritten as: [ a x_0^n + b x_0^{n-1} + c x_0^{n-2} + dots + k x_0 + l = 0. ] 4. **Factoring the Polynomial**: Isolate (l): [ x_0 left(a x_0^{n-1} + b x_0^{n-2} + c x_0^{n-3} + dots + k right) = - l. ] 5. **Interpretation**: Since (x_0) divides the left-hand side and (a x_0^{n-1} + b x_0^{n-2} + c x_0^{n-3} + dots + k) is an integer, (x_0) divides (-l), meaning (x_0) is a divisor of (l). **Conclusion**: Thus, if a polynomial equation of degree (n) with integer coefficients has an integer root (x_0 neq 0), then (x_0) must be a divisor of the constant term (l).

Define a sequence ( {a_n} ) as follows: [ begin{cases} a_0 = f(a) a_1 = a a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - 3a_n, quad n = 0,1,2,ldots end{cases} ] From the given conditions, we have ( f(a_{n+1}) = a_n ) and ( a_n geq 0 ). The characteristic equation of the sequence ( {a_n} ) is: [ t^2 + 3t - 4 = 0 ] Solving for ( t ), we get the roots: [ t = 1 quad text{and} quad t = -4 ] Thus, the general solution of the sequence can be written as: [ a_n = c_1 cdot 1^n + c_2 cdot (-4)^n ] Given the initial conditions ( a_0 = f(a) ) and ( a_1 = a ), we can solve for the constants ( c_1 ) and ( c_2 ): [ begin{cases} c_1 + c_2 = f(a) c_1 - 4c_2 = a end{cases} ] Solving these equations, we have: [ c_1 = frac{4 f(a) + a}{5}, quad c_2 = frac{f(a) - a}{5} ] Since ( f(a) neq a ), ( c_2 neq 0 ). Consider the two cases for ( c_2 ): 1. **Case ( c_2 > 0 )**: Calculate ( a_{2k+1} ): [ a_{2k+1} = c_1 cdot 1^{2k+1} + c_2 cdot (-4)^{2k+1} = c_1 - c_2 cdot 4^{2k+1} ] As ( k to infty ): [ lim_{k to infty} frac{a_{2k+1}}{4^{2k+1}} = lim_{k to infty} left(frac{c_1}{4^{2k+1}} - c_2right) = -c_2 < 0 ] This implies ( frac{a_{2k+1}}{4^{2k+1}} < 0 ) for sufficiently large ( k ), conflicting with ( a_n geq 0 ). 2. **Case ( c_2 < 0 )**: Calculate ( a_{2k} ): [ a_{2k} = c_1 cdot 1^{2k} + c_2 cdot (-4)^{2k} = c_1 + c_2 cdot 16^k ] As ( k to infty ): [ lim_{k to infty} frac{a_{2k}}{16^k} = c_2 < 0 ] This implies ( frac{a_{2k}}{16^k} < 0 ) for sufficiently large ( k ), also conflicting with ( a_n geq 0 ). Thus, in both cases, we reach a contradiction. Hence, our assumption that ( f(a) neq a ) must be wrong. Therefore, the function satisfying the given conditions must be: [ boxed{f(x) = x} ]"},{"prompt":"Jake and his sister Kendra have a certain weight ratio.

According to the information given: 1) J - 8 = 2K (After Jake loses 8 pounds, he will weigh twice as much as Kendra) 2) J + K = 293 (Together they now weigh 293 pounds) From equation 1, we can express J in terms of K: J = 2K + 8 Now, we can substitute this expression for J into equation 2: (2K + 8) + K = 293 Combining like terms, we get: 3K + 8 = 293 Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get: 3K = 285 Dividing both sides by 3, we find K: K = 285 / 3 K = 95 Now that we have Kendra's weight, we can find Jake's current weight by substituting K back into equation 2: J + 95 = 293 J = 293 - 95 J = 198 Now we know Jake's current weight is 198 pounds and Kendra's current weight is 95 pounds. After Jake loses 8 pounds, his weight will be: J - 8 = 198 - 8 J - 8 = 190 The ratio of Jake's weight to Kendra's weight after he loses 8 pounds will be: Jake's weight after losing 8 pounds / Kendra's current weight = 190 / 95 Simplifying the ratio, we get: 190 / 95 = 2 / 1 So the ratio of Jake's weight to Kendra's weight after he loses 8 pounds is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"f the point left(m,nright) in the first quadrant is symmetric with respect to the line x+y2=0 and lies on the line 2x+y+3=0, then the minimum value of frac{1}{m}+frac{8}{n} is ( ).

These sets represent the smallest and largest numbers on the board, respectively. 2. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle:** We need to show that there is always a row or column that contains at least one number from ( S_1 ) and one number from ( S_2 ). 3. **Covering the board with rows and columns:** Suppose the numbers in ( S_1 ) are covered by ( m ) rows and ( n ) columns. Since there are 26 numbers in ( S_1 ), we have: [ 26 leq mn ] By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality), we know: [ mn leq left(frac{m+n}{2}right)^2 ] Therefore: [ 26 leq left(frac{m+n}{2}right)^2 ] Taking the square root of both sides: [ sqrt{26} leq frac{m+n}{2} ] Multiplying both sides by 2: [ 2sqrt{26} leq m+n ] Since ( sqrt{26} approx 5.1 ), we have: [ 2 times 5.1 approx 10.2 implies m+n > 10 ] 4. **Similar argument for the large numbers:** Similarly, consider the set ( S_2 ).

The angle ( angle AO_2P ) around the center ( O_2 ) is given by: [ angle A O_2 P = 360^circ cdot frac{m}{m+n} ] 6. The angle formed at ( P ) by the tangent ( AP ) and the radius ( O_2P ) is: [ angle P A O_2 = frac{1}{2}left(180^circ - angle A O_2 P right) = 90^circ cdot frac{n-m}{n+m} ] 7. Given that ( angle P A O_2 ) is half of ( angle AO_1O_2 ) and represents the angle between tangent and chord, we have: [ angle A O_1 O_2 = 2 angle P A O_2 = 180^circ cdot frac{n-m}{n+m} ] 8. This implies that: [ angle A O_1 B = 2 angle A O_1 O_2 = 360^circ cdot frac{n-m}{n+m} ] 9. In the first circle, the arc ( overset{frown}{AOB} ) is given by: [ overset{frown}{AOB} = 360^circ cdot frac{n-m}{n+m} ] 10. Therefore, the complementary arc of the first circle will be: [ 360^circ - 360^circ cdot frac{n-m}{n+m} = 360^circ cdot frac{2m}{n+m} ] 11. Thus, the ratio in which the second circle divides the first circle is: [ frac{n-m}{2m} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{n-m}{2m}} ]"},{"prompt":"measuring the sides of a rectangular prism, one side is taken 8% in excess, the second side 10% in deficit, and the third side 6% in deficit.

The second side is measured 10% in deficit, so the erroneous length of this side is b * (1 - 10/100) = b * 0.90. The third side is measured 6% in deficit, so the erroneous length of this side is c * (1 - 6/100) = c * 0.94.

The error in volume (E) is the difference between the erroneous volume and the actual volume: E = V_erroneous - V_actual To find the error percentage, we divide the error by the actual volume and multiply by 100: Error percentage = (E / V_actual) * 100 Substituting the expressions for V_erroneous and V_actual, we get: Error percentage = [(a * 1.08 * b * 0.90 * c * 0.94) - (a * b * c)] / (a * b * c) * 100 Error percentage = [(1.08 * 0.90 * 0.94) - 1] * 100 Now, let's calculate the value inside the brackets: Error percentage = [(1.08 * 0.90 * 0.94) - 1] * 100 Error percentage = [0.97272 - 1] * 100 Error percentage = -0.02728 * 100 Error percentage = -2.728% The negative sign indicates that the calculated volume is less than the actual volume.

Prove that at least one airline can provide two disjoint tour circuits, each capable of touring an odd number of cities.","completion":": 1. Let's represent the 10 cities using 10 vertices of a complete graph (K_{10}). The two airline companies' flight routes are represented by red and blue edges, respectively. The problem can be translated to showing that in this two-colored (K_{10}), there exists at least one company (one color) that provides two disjoint odd cycles, where each cycle has an odd number of vertices. 2. Consider a complete graph (K_{10}) with its edges colored either red or blue. We need to show that there exist two disjoint odd cycles of the same color. 3. First, let's randomly pick a complete subgraph (K_{6}) from (K_{10}). According to Ramsey's theorem, in a two-colored (K_{6}), there must be a monochromatic triangle (a cycle of length 3, (C_3)). 4. Without loss of generality, let's say this monochromatic triangle is a blue triangle formed by vertices (A_1, A_2, A_3). Remove these three vertices from (K_{10}). We are left with a (K_7). 5. Now, consider the remaining graph (K_7) (with 7 vertices). By Ramsey's theorem again, in this two-colored (K_7), there must be another monochromatic triangle. Let's denote this second monochromatic triangle by (B_4, B_5, B_6). 6. We now have two monochromatic triangles of the same color (blue) and since they are from disjoint sets of vertices, these two triangles are disjoint. 7. If these monochromatic triangles were of different colors, one blue (Delta A_1A_2A_3) and one red (Delta B_4B_5B_6), consider the 9 edges between any vertex in the set { (A_1, A_2, A_3) } and any vertex in the set { (B_4, B_5, B_6) }. 8. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least 5 edges among these 9 edges must be of the same color. Without loss of generality, assume these 5 edges are blue. Among the vertices (B_4, B_5, B_6), at least one vertex (B_4) has at least two blue edges connecting it to (A_1, A_2,) and (A_3). Let's assume these edges are ( B_4A_2 ) and ( B_4A_3 ). 9. Hence, (B_4, A_2, A_3) forms another blue triangle (Delta B_4A_2A_3 ). However, this blue triangle (Delta B_4A_2A_3) shares a common vertex (B_4) with the red triangle (Delta B_4B_5B_6). 10. Remove vertices (A_2, A_3, B_4, B_5, B_6), which leaves us with 5 vertices ( C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5 ) (with possibly (A_1) included). 11. Examine the (K_5) graph formed by these 5 vertices. If there exists a monochromatic triangle within this graph, we again have two monochromatic triangles of the same color which are disjoint. 12. If no monochromatic triangle exists, by the first case of Ramsey's theorem, this (K_5) can be decomposed into two monochromatic cycles with 5 edges each, one red and one blue. Therefore, in this scenario, there exist two odd cycles (one of each color) without common vertices. 13. Hence, we have confirmed that there must exist at least one airline company capable of providing two disjoint odd cycles in the flight routing.

From the given equation, differentiating both sides with respect to x gives 2{f'}(2x+1) + 2{f'}(2-2x) = 4, which simplifies to {f'}(2x+1) + {f'}(2-2x) = 2. This implies that {f'}(x) is symmetric with respect to the point left(frac{3}{2}, 1right), leading to the conclusion that {f'}(x) has a period of 6. Therefore, {f'}left(frac{123}{2}right) = {f'}left(frac{3}{2}right) = 1, making statement C correct. Thus, we encapsulate this as boxed{C} is correct. **For Statement D:** Given the symmetry and periodicity of {f'}(x), we can deduce that for any i, {f'}left(frac{i}{20}right) + {f'}left(frac{60-i}{20}right) = 2. Summing over i from 1 to 59 gives: [sum_{i=1}^{59}{f'left(frac{i}{20}right)} = 2 times frac{59-1}{2} + 1 = 59] This confirms that statement D is correct, and we encapsulate this as boxed{D} is correct. **Conclusion:** The correct statements are A, C, and D, which we encapsulate as boxed{A, C, D} are correct."},{"prompt":"Which of the following calculations is correct?

Since there is only one such term, we have 6 options to place this term in the sequence. Next, we need to determine where to place the two terms that are 2.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of the focus of the parabola and the equation of its directrix.

The standard form for a parabola is y = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola, and the focus is located at (h, k + frac{1}{4a}) when the parabola opens upwards. Comparing the given equation with the standard form, we have a = frac{1}{4}, (h,k) = (0,0). Therefore, the focus F has coordinates (0, k + frac{1}{4a}) = (0, 0 + frac{1}{4 cdot frac{1}{4}}) = (0, 1). The directrix is the line parallel to the vertex, and its equation is y = k - frac{1}{4a} = 0 - frac{1}{4 cdot frac{1}{4}} = -1.

Assume there exists a prime ( p ) such that [ p mid gcdleft(binom{n}{1}, binom{n}{2}, ldots, binom{n}{n-1}right). ] Specifically, [ p mid binom{n}{1} = n. ] Let ( v_{p}(n) = alpha ), which means ( p^{alpha} mid n ) but ( p^{alpha+1} nmid n ). Given that ( n ) has at least two different prime factors, we have ( 0 < p^{alpha} < n ). By Lucas' Theorem (or Kummer's Theorem), it is known that: [ p nmid binom{n}{p^alpha} mod p, ] which leads to a contradiction. Hence, [ gcdleft(binom{n}{1}, binom{n}{2}, ldots, binom{n}{n-1}right) = 1. ] 3. **Using the Lemma:** Consider ( n ) such that ( n ) does not contain mutually prime factors, specifically ( n = 1 ) or ( n = p^{alpha} ) where ( p ) is a prime, and ( alpha ) is a positive integer. 4. **Construction of Polynomials:** - If ( n = 1 ), set ( f(x) = frac{1}{2} ), which is a polynomial satisfying the conditions. - If ( n = p^{alpha} ), consider: [ f(x) = frac{1}{p} binom{x-1}{p^alpha - 1}. ] Thus, [ f(x) = frac{1}{p} cdot frac{(x-1)(x-2) cdots left(x - p^alpha + 1right)}{left(p^{alpha} - 1right)!}. ] We see that the degree of ( f(x) ) is ( p^alpha - 1 ), which satisfies condition (2). 5. **Verification of Condition (1):** We need to show that: [ p mid binom{k-1}{p^alpha-1} Leftrightarrow n nmid k. ] Given ( v_{p}(m) = r ), satisfying ( p^r mid m ), we analyze two scenarios: - If ( n mid k ): For ( 1 leq i leq p^alpha-1 ), ( v_{p}(i) < alpha ), and due to properties of the binomial coefficient, [ v_{p}(k-i) = v_{p}(i) = v_{p}(p^alpha - i). ] Hence, [ frac{(k-1)(k-2) cdots (k - p^alpha + 1)}{left(p^alpha - 1right)!} ] is obviously not a multiple of ( p ). - If ( n nmid k ): Since ( binom{k-1}{p^alpha - 1} = frac{p^alpha}{k} binom{k}{p^alpha} ) and considering ( v_{p}(i) < alpha ), this implies [ p mid binom{k-1}{p^alpha - 1}. ] Hence, satisfying condition (1). 6. **Conclusion:** If ( n ) has at least two different prime factors, no polynomial ( f(x) ) can satisfy the given conditions. When ( n = 1 ) or ( n = p^alpha ) (where ( p ) is a prime), the polynomial ( f(x) = frac{1}{p}binom{x-1}{p^alpha-1} ) works.

The function becomes f(x) = a^x + a^x - c^x = 2a^x - c^x. The function f(x) will have a root if there exists x such that 2a^x = c^x, or 2 = left(frac{c}{a}right)^x. Since frac{c}{a} > 1 (as c > a), the equation 2 = left(frac{c}{a}right)^x will have a solution for x in (0, infty). However, when x leq 0, a^x and c^x are non-negative and their sum is always greater than c^x, thus there is no solution. For x = 0, 2a^0 = c^0 becomes 2 = 1, which is false, so there is no root at x = 0. When x > 0, a^x and c^x are both increasing functions, and since a < c, their rates of increase are such that the gap between 2a^x and c^x decreases. Therefore, as x increases from 0 to 1, f(x) will start positive and decrease, eventually hitting 0 at a single point. It cannot be the case for x > 1 because if f(x) = 0 for some x > 1, due to the exponential nature of the expressions, f(x) would have to become negative for some x > 1, which would allow for the possibility of (a, b, c) satisfying the triangle inequality, violating the condition for M.

Therefore, a^x + b^x will be less than a + b, which is less than c, so the sum a^x + b^x - c^x must be negative, contradicting the statement that f(x) > 0.

Prove that on this art object it is possible to erase all lines of some one color such that from any marked point it is still possible to get to any other by moving along the remaining lines.","completion":"Given: - A complete graph ( K_{40} ) with 40 vertices, where each edge is colored with one of six colors. To Prove: - It is possible to erase all lines of some one color such that from any marked point it is still possible to get to any other by moving along the remaining lines. 1. **Understanding the Total Edges:** - In a complete graph ( K_{40} ), the number of edges is calculated by the binomial coefficient (binom{40}{2}): [ binom{40}{2} = frac{40 times 39}{2} = 780 ] 2. **Edges Per Color:** - Since each edge is colored with one of six colors (and assuming an even distribution for the argument's sake), on average, each color will be responsible for [ frac{780}{6} = 130 ] edges. 3. **Evaluating the Connectivity per Color:** - Consider any particular color. If we remove all edges of that color, we need to ensure the remaining edges form a connected subgraph. 4. **Minimum Degree Argument:** - Using the Handshaking Lemma (each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices), each vertex ( v ) is connected to 39 others. So, each color contributes about [ frac{780}{40 times 2} = 9.75 ] edges per vertex on average. Because we are considering integer numbers of edges, the actual distribution may vary, but this gives us a sense of coverage. 5. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle and Connectivity:** - With six colors, the average number of edges per color is 130. Hence, the removal of any one color removes about 130 edges. - The complete graph ( K_{40} ) is highly connected due to a large number of edges. Even after removing one color's correspondences: [ 780 - 130 = 650 ] edges remain. 6. **Ramsey Theory Application:** - Using principles from Ramsey Theory, we know that in any large graph colored with multiple colors, there will be significant substructures of similar color patterns ensuring connectivity. Indeed, each smaller subgraph formed by remaining edges will preserve a robust connectivity. 7. **Conclusion by Connectivity Induction:** - Removing all edges of any one color ( c ) results in: [ K_{40} - E_c ] The remaining subgraph must still be connected since each vertex still maintains a large number of connections (greater than 1 for this density). Thus, one can erase all edges of some single color while ensuring the graph remains connected.

Thus, statement A is incorrect. **Statement B: If a < b < 0, then frac{1}{a} < frac{1}{b}** Given a < b < 0, we know: - ab > 0 (since both a and b are negative, their product is positive) Considering the fractions frac{1}{a} and frac{1}{b}, we have: frac{a}{ab} < frac{b}{ab} < 0 This simplifies to: frac{1}{b} < frac{1}{a} This contradicts the given statement. Therefore, statement B is incorrect. **Statement C: If a < b < 0, then a^2 > ab > b^2** Given a < b < 0, we first analyze a^2 and ab: - Since a and b are both negative and a < b, it follows that a^2 > ab because multiplying by a more negative number (a) makes the product larger in a negative context. Next, examining ab and b^2: - Since a < b < 0, it follows that ab > b^2 because, again, multiplying by the more negative number (a) results in a larger product in a negative context. Combining these, we get: a^2 > ab > b^2 Therefore, statement C is correct. **Statement D: If a < b < 0, then frac{b}{a} > frac{a}{b}** Given a < b < 0, we have: - frac{b}{a} which is less than 1 because |b| < |a| (absolute values since both are negative and we are comparing magnitudes).

Let E be his original monthly expenses. So, E = 0.80S. After the increase of 20% in his expenses, his new expenses will be E + 0.20E = 1.20E.

The total number of text messages sent over the five days is the sum of the messages sent on each day: Total = M + M/2 + 150 The average number of text messages sent over the five days is the total number of messages divided by 5: Average = Total / 5 We are given that the average is 96 text messages per day, so we can set up the equation: 96 = (M + M/2 + 150) / 5 Now, let's solve for M: 96 * 5 = M + M/2 + 150 480 = M + M/2 + 150 To combine like terms, we need to have a common denominator for M and M/2. The common denominator is 2, so we rewrite M as 2M/2: 480 = 2M/2 + M/2 + 150 480 = (2M + M) / 2 + 150 480 = 3M/2 + 150 Now, let's isolate the term with M: 480 - 150 = 3M/2 330 = 3M/2 To solve for M, we multiply both sides by 2/3: 330 * (2/3) = M 220 = M So, Jason sent boxed{220} text messages on Monday."},{"prompt":"The annual interest rate earned by an investment increased by some percent from last year to this year.

Given that the average of these numbers is 33, we can write the following equation: (frac{(x - 3d) + (x - d) + x + (x + d) + (x + 3d) + (x + 5d) + (x + 9d)}{7} = 33) Simplifying the equation, we get: (frac{7x + 14d}{7} = 33) (7x + 14d = 231) Since (d = 2), we can substitute (d) into the equation: (7x + 14(2) = 231) (7x + 28 = 231) (7x = 231 - 28) (7x = 203) (x = frac{203}{7}) (x = 29) So the middle number in the sequence is 29.

Let (a) be the length of the equal edges, and let (b) be the length of the space diagonal. According to the problem, the length of the third edge is ( (a pm 1) ). 2.

In this case, we need to exclude the 10 kg sheep from our calculations, so we have n-1 sheep whose weights form the arithmetic sequence, and their total weight is 55 kg.

Since ( p ) is a prime number greater than 2, it follows that the right-hand side, ( p(x + y) ), is a multiple of ( p ). Thus, ( 2xy ) must also be a multiple of ( p ). 4. Given ( gcd(p, 2) = 1 ), either ( x ) or ( y ) must be a multiple of ( p ). Let us assume ( x = px' ) where ( x' ) is an integer.

The answer is B. First, determine the range of -x^{2}+2x when 0 leqslant x < 3, then use the monotonicity of the exponential function to determine the range. This problem assesses the ability to find the range of a composite function. To solve, consider the monotonicity of the composite function in order to determine the function's range. This is a basic-level problem. Solution (Enhanced): 1. First, rewrite the given function y=e^{-x^{2}+2x}. Complete the square for -x^{2}+2x to get -(x-1)^{2}+1.

When a > 0, let g′(x)=0, we get x= dfrac{1}{a}. g′(x) > 0, we get 0 < x < dfrac{1}{a}, at this time the function g(x) is monotonically increasing; Let g′(x) < 0, we get x > dfrac{1}{a}, at this time the function g(x) is monotonically decreasing. therefore When x= dfrac{1}{a}, the function g(x) reaches its maximum value, when x approaches 0 and x approaches +infty, g(x)rightarrow-infty, To have g(x)=0 with two real roots in the interval (0,+infty), then g( dfrac{1}{a})=ln dfrac{1}{a} > 0 , we get 0 < a < dfrac{1}{2}.

Given the integral equation: [ int_0^x sin t cdot f(x-t) , dt = f(x) - sin x ] we need to find the continuous function ( f(x) ) that satisfies this equation for any real number ( x ). 2. First, substitute ( x = 0 ) into the equation: [ int_0^0 sin t cdot f(0-t) , dt = f(0) - sin 0 ] Since the integral from 0 to 0 is zero, we get: [ 0 = f(0) ] Therefore, ( f(0) = 0 ). 3.

We will also denote by A_2, B_2, and C_2 the midpoints of the segments AH, BH, and CH respectively. First, observe that the triangles AB_1C_1, A_1BC_1, and A_1B_1C are similar to each other (with corresponding vertices denoted by the same letters). It should also be noted that A_2, B_2, and C_2 are the centers of the circles circumscribed around these triangles. To prove the statement, let us start by demonstrating that three lines passing through the points A_2, B_2, and C_2 and symmetrically positioned relative to the triangles AB_1C_1, A_1BC_1, and A_1B_1C intersect at a single point on the nine-point circle. 1. **Lines through Nine-Point Circle:** - Notice that the lines A_2B_1, B_2B, and C_2B_1 are symmetrically positioned concerning the triangles AB_1C_1, A_1BC_1, and A_1B_1C. They intersect at the point B_1, which lies on the nine-point circle. 2. **Rotating Lines:** - Since points A_2, B_2, and C_2 lie on the nine-point circle, it is evident that the three lines obtained by rotating the initial lines A_2B_1, B_2B, and C_2B_1 around points A_2, B_2, and C_2 respectively by the same angle will also intersect at a single point on the nine-point circle. Let P be the point of intersection of the Euler lines of triangles AB_1C_1, A_1BC_1, and A_1B_1C. 3. **Angle Consideration:** - Let us denote angle PA_2A = varphi. For simplicity, we consider the triangle ABC to be an acute-angled triangle, and suppose P lies on the arc B_1A_2 of the nine-point circle. 4. **Angle Calculations:** - Therefore, angle PA_2A_1 = 180^circ - varphi, - angle PA_2B_1 = 180^circ - varphi - angle B_1A_2A_1 = 180^circ - varphi - angle B_1C_1A_1 = 2angle C - varphi, - angle PA_2C_1 = 360^circ - varphi - 2angle B. Since the chords PA_1, PB_1, and PC_1 are proportional to the sines of their respective angles, our goal is to prove that one out of the three values sin varphi, sin (2C-varphi), -sin (2B+varphi) equals the sum of the other two. Hence, we need to demonstrate that: sin varphi = sin (2C - varphi) - sin (2B + varphi). 5. **Using Sine Rule:** - In the triangle AA_2H_1, where |AA_2| = R, |AH_1| = 2R cos A (R is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and R cos A is the distance from the center to B_1C_1), - angle H_1AA_2 = angle A + 2angle B - 180^circ. Using the Sine Rule for triangle AA_2H_1: frac{2 cos A}{sin varphi} = frac{1}{sin (2B + A + varphi)}, we get: -sin (2B + 2A + varphi) - sin (2B + varphi) = sin varphi Rightarrow sin (2C - varphi) - sin (2B + varphi) = sin varphi, which proves the required result. Thus, the theorem holds in the case of an acute-angled triangle, and as detailed in the solution, similar considerations apply to obtuse-angled triangles. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the set A={x|x^2<3x+4, xin mathbb{R}}, find the number of elements in Acap mathbb{Z}.","completion":"To solve this, we first determine the set A={x|x^2<3x+4, xin mathbb{R}}={x|-1<x<4}.

The corresponding trigonometric theorem does not require such a distinction. Why?","completion":"To explore why the trigonometric theorem does not need to account for whether the angle is acute or obtuse while the geometric theorem does, we’ll delve deeper into both the geometric and trigonometric formulations. 1. **Geometric Theorem for a Non-Right Triangle**: - The classic geometric theorem for any triangle not necessarily right, gives us: [ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos alpha ] where ( a ) is the side opposite the angle (alpha), and ( b ) and ( c ) are the other sides. 2. **Trigonometric Theorem**: - In the trigonometric form, the theorem still remains: [ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos alpha ] Here, (cos alpha) would vary based on whether angle (alpha) is acute or obtuse. 3. **Cosine Values Based on Angle Type**: - For an acute angle (alpha) (i.e., (0 < alpha < 90^circ)): [ cos alpha > 0 ] This means ( cos alpha ) would be positive. - For an obtuse angle (alpha) (i.e., (90^circ < alpha < 180^circ)): [ cos alpha < 0 ] This means ( cos alpha ) would be negative. 4. **Implications on the Formula**: - In case of an acute angle: [ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos alpha quad (cos alpha > 0) ] The term ( -2bc cos alpha ) subtracts from (b^2 + c^2), but still remains positive due to cosine's positivity. - In case of an obtuse angle: [ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos alpha quad (cos alpha < 0) ] Here, ( -2bc cos alpha ) actually adds to (b^2 + c^2) due to cosine’s negativity (i.e., ( - times - = + )). 5. **Conclusion**: - Despite whether (alpha) is acute or obtuse, the formula (a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos alpha) remains consistent. - The cosine term ( cos alpha ), changing sign based on the angle type, naturally adjusts the right-hand side of the equation correctly to maintain equality. Thus, the trigonometric formulation inherently adapts to whether the angle is acute or obtuse via the cosine function, eliminating the need for separate cases.

Note that a one-story house cannot be classified as interesting because it cannot be taller than any other house. 2. **Establish the lower limit for interesting houses:** The smallest house that can be interesting is the two-story house (2). Let's consider the smallest 10 interesting houses, which are the houses ranging from 2 to 11 (inclusive). 3. **Calculate the sum of the heights of these houses:** To determine if the sum of the heights of the smallest 10 interesting houses can equal 64, we add the heights of these houses: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11. 4. **Sum up these heights:** We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series (S = frac{n}{2} (a + l)), where (n) is the number of terms, (a) is the first term, and (l) is the last term. Here, (n = 10), (a = 2), (l = 11).

Recall the derivative expression: y' = 2ax - frac{1}{x} Substitute a = frac{1}{2}: y' = x - frac{1}{x} To find where the derivative is positive, we'll solve the inequality: x - frac{1}{x} > 0 Multiplying through by x (assuming xneq 0): x^2 - 1 > 0 (x - 1)(x + 1) > 0 The solutions to the inequality are x < -1 and x > 1. However, we must keep in mind that the domain of the original function y = ax^2 - ln x also needs to be considered, which is x > 0 (due to the natural logarithm). Thus, the interval where the function is strictly increasing is boxed{x > 1}."},{"prompt":"There are 101 points marked on a plane, not all of them lie on the same straight line.

Let's denote the 101 points in the plane by ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{101} ). 2. By the problem statement, these points do not all lie on a single straight line. 3. Suppose through any selected point ( A ) in our set, at most 10 of the red lines (lines connecting ( A ) with other points) can pass. Hence, point ( A ) would be connected to at most 10 other points. 4. We then consider the remaining 100 points. Each line passing through ( A ) connects ( A ) with another point in our set. Therefore, there are 100 marked points, minus the possibly 10 points already connected to ( A ), leaving us with a total of 90 different points to consider. 5. According to the Pigeonhole Principle (which states that if more pigeons than pigeonholes are put into pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon), if we distribute 90 points amongst 10 possible lines, then at least one of these lines, let’s denote this line by ( l ), must contain at least ( leftlceil frac{90}{10} rightrceil = 9 ) points. 6. Including the point ( A ) on this line ( l ), we have that ( l ) contains at least ( 9 + 1 = 10 ) points, and because we have initially considered a line to be formed by pairs of marked points, the lines forming through pairs of points will break any single line's constraint of having 10 points max. 7. Now, let us examine whether the remaining cases sustain the result: consider a point ( B ) which does not lie on line ( l ). Then, point ( B ) must be connected to at least another 11 different points by other lines because otherwise, it would form a configuration on its own. 8. This means that ( B ) can be connected by lines passing through points ( P_j ) other than already counted or shared elsewhere, enforcing the construction of these remaining subsets cannot contradict the condition again of minimum lines, shared maximum overlaps permissible. 9. Since redundancies are checked noniteratively and changes yield correctly, there will essentially be at least one configuration with the intersecting constraints holding as proof. 10. Therefore, the condition to find a point through which at least 11 red lines pass is proven by contradiction check and case-spanning.

Given the conditions mid a mid > 2 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = abc + 4, we start by manipulating the given equation. We can rewrite it as: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - abc = 4 ] 2. We need to prove that there exist numbers x and y such that a = x + frac{1}{x}, b = y + frac{1}{y}, and c = xy + frac{1}{xy}. 3. Consider the equation a = x + frac{1}{x}. This can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in x: [ x^2 - ax + 1 = 0 ] The discriminant of this quadratic equation is: [ Delta = a^2 - 4 ] Since mid a mid > 2, we have a^2 > 4, which implies Delta > 0. Therefore, the quadratic equation has two real roots, and we can find such an x. 4. Similarly, for b = y + frac{1}{y}, we can write: [ y^2 - by + 1 = 0 ] The discriminant of this quadratic equation is: [ Delta = b^2 - 4 ] Since mid b mid ge 2 (as shown later), we have b^2 ge 4, which implies Delta ge 0. Therefore, the quadratic equation has real roots, and we can find such a y. 5. Next, we need to show that c = xy + frac{1}{xy}. Consider the expression (a^2 - 4)(b^2 - 4): [ (a^2 - 4)(b^2 - 4) = a^2b^2 - 4(a^2 + b^2) + 16 ] Using the given equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = abc + 4, we can substitute a^2 + b^2 = abc + 4 - c^2: [ (a^2 - 4)(b^2 - 4) = a^2b^2 - 4(abc + 4 - c^2) + 16 ] Simplifying, we get: [ (a^2 - 4)(b^2 - 4) = a^2b^2 - 4abc - 16 + 4c^2 + 16 ] [ (a^2 - 4)(b^2 - 4) = a^2b^2 - 4abc + 4c^2 ] 6. Notice that (ab - 2c)^2 = a^2b^2 - 4abc + 4c^2. Therefore: [ (a^2 - 4)(b^2 - 4) = (ab - 2c)^2 ] Since (ab - 2c)^2 ge 0, we have mid b mid ge 2. 7.

To find the critical points of ( f(x) ), we first compute its first derivative: [ f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n 4(x-k)^3 ] 3. Next, we compute the second derivative of ( f(x) ): [ f''(x) = sum_{k=1}^n 12(x-k)^2 ] 4. Since ( n ge 2 ), each term ( 12(x-k)^2 ) in the sum is non-negative and at least one term is positive. Therefore, ( f''(x) > 0 ) for all ( x ). This implies that ( f(x) ) is a strictly convex function, meaning it has a unique minimum. 5. To find the minimum, we solve for ( x ) such that ( f'(x) = 0 ): [ f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n 4(x-k)^3 = 0 ] 6. We observe that the function ( g(x) = sum_{k=1}^n (x-k)^3 ) is symmetric around ( x = frac{n+1}{2} ). This is because for each ( k ) in the sum, there is a corresponding term ( (x-(n+1-k))^3 ) that balances it out when ( x = frac{n+1}{2} ). 7. Therefore, we evaluate ( f' left( frac{n+1}{2} right) ): [ f' left( frac{n+1}{2} right) = sum_{k=1}^n 4 left( frac{n+1}{2} - k right)^3 ] 8. By symmetry, the sum of the terms ( left( frac{n+1}{2} - k right)^3 ) and ( left( frac{n+1}{2} - (n+1-k) right)^3 ) will cancel out, leading to: [ f' left( frac{n+1}{2} right) = 0 ] 9.

The other roots of p(x) and q(x) can be x_1 and x_2 respectively. - We consider that both polynomials share one common root due to the constraint of the product having exactly three distinct roots, suggesting one root is repeated in the product. 3. **Expressions for Common Root:** - Assume x_0 = 1 as a common root for simplicity: Comparing the values: 0 = (1)^2 + a(1) + b - (1)^2 + b(1) + a Simplifying this, we get (a - b) cdot (1 - 1) = 0 hence, 1 is indeed a root satisfying common root condition irrespective of specific values of a and b under valid discriminants. 4. **Relationship between a and b:** - Since 1 is root for both, substituting x=1: For p(x): 1 + a + b = 0 or equivalently, b = -a - 1. 5. **Factored Polynomials:** - Substitute b = -a - 1 back into the polynomial equations: p(x) = x^2 + ax - (a + 1) = (x - 1)(x + a + 1) q(x) = x^2 + (-a-1)x + a = (x - 1)(x - a) 6. **Summing the Distinct Roots:** - The roots of p(x) cdot q(x) are: 1, -(a + 1), a. - Calculate the total sum of these roots: 1 + (-(a + 1)) + a = 1 - a - 1 + a = 0 # Conclusion: The sum of the three distinct roots can be seen to be zero.

If we haven't reached 10 balls of one color after picking up to 27 balls (9 each from red, blue, and yellow), we still need to add these random colored balls: [ 27 text{ earlier balls} + 10 text{ black/white balls} = 37 text{ balls} ] 4. **Ensuring One Color Reaches 10 Balls:** At this point, we have 37 balls, and we still don't have 10 of any color.

We need to determine whether it's possible for all five smaller triangles to be congruent. 3. The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is (180^circ). Hence, for any two adjacent triangles sharing a vertex, the sum of their respective angles at that vertex equals (180^circ). 4. Look at vertex A. Since two angles at vertex A belong to two adjacent triangles, their sum must be equal to (180^circ). Hence, each of these angles must be (90^circ) (because (90^circ + 90^circ = 180^circ)). 5. This means that each of these smaller triangles is a right-angled triangle. Moreover, since they are congruent, all their corresponding sides are equal. 6.

Prove that all of its faces are congruent triangles.","completion":"1. Consider a tetrahedron (ABCD). According to the problem, the sum of the three plane angles at each vertex of the tetrahedron equals (180^circ). 2. To illustrate this, imagine unfolding the faces of the tetrahedron and laying them flat in a plane. Specifically, consider the face (ABC) as the base. 3. When the tetrahedron is unfolded, the faces (ABD), (BCD), and (CAD) unfold into triangular regions in the plane, denoted as (ABE), (BCF), and (CAG), respectively. 4. By examining the angle sums, we observe that the angles at vertex (A) (i.e., (EAB), (BAC), and (CAG)) must add up to (180^circ), because these angles are representative of the dihedral angles at vertex (A) in the original tetrahedron configuration. 5. Due to the sum of angles condition, the point (A) must lie on a straight line formed by extending the segments (AE) and (AG), thus aligning (A) along the line segment (EG). 6. Similarly, consider the vertices (B) and (C). The angle sums at vertices (B) (angles (EBF), (BCA), and (CBG)) and (C) (angles (FCB), (CAG), and (CAB)) also equal (180^circ). Therefore, points (B) and (C) lie on the straight lines (EF) and (FG) respectively. 7. Consequently, when unfolded, the layout of the tetrahedron's faces forms a larger triangle (EFG), with (A), (B), and (C) lying on its sides (GE), (EF), and (FG) accordingly. 8. Consider now the equal lengths within this unfolded configuration: (EA = AG), (EB = BF), and (FC = CG), since these segments correspond to the edges (AD), (BD), and (CD) of the tetrahedron. 9. Furthermore, because (EA = AG), (EB = BF), and (FC = CG), the segments (AB), (BC), and (CA) become the midlines of the triangle (EFG) in the unfolded configuration. - A midline in a triangle is the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. Each midline is parallel to the third side and half of its length. 10. Given that (AB), (BC), and (CA) are midlines, each triangle formed by these midlines and the sides of (EFG) are equal in smaller triangles that preserve congruence criteria due to the unfolding and midline properties. 11. Consequently, the tetrahedron’s faces unfolding into equal triangles (EAB), (Bcf), and (CAG) implies that each face (ABD), (BCD), and (CAD) of the tetrahedron is identical and congruent. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is proved that all faces of the tetrahedron must be congruent and hence must be equal triangles. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Four runners ran a combined total of 195 miles last week.

The shape ( F ) is bounded between two parallel lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) such that both ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) have points on the boundary of ( F ). 3. Let the distance between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) be ( d ). Assume ( l_x ) is a line parallel to ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ), and the distance between ( l_x ) and ( l_1 ) is ( x ) where ( l_x ) is a line between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ). 4.

We want to find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that there exist subsets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k subseteq S ) with the following property: For any two distinct elements ( a, b in S ), there exists a subset ( A_j ) (where ( j in {1, 2, ldots, k} )) such that the intersection ( A_j cap {a, b} ) is a singleton set (i.e., contains exactly one of ( a ) or ( b )). 2. **Matrix Construction:** We define a ( k times n ) matrix ( (a_{ij}) ) where ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ) and ( j = 1, 2, ldots, n ). The entries ( a_{ij} ) are defined as follows: [ a_{ij} = begin{cases} 1, & text{if } j in A_i, 0, & text{if } j notin A_i. end{cases} ] 3. **Property Analysis:** For any two distinct elements ( a, b in S ), there must exist some index ( i ) such that ( A_i cap {a, b} ) is a singleton set. This implies that the columns ( P_a ) and ( P_b ) of the matrix must differ in at least one of the ( k ) positions.

Thus, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, 2 - sqrt{4-a}), monotonically increasing on (2 - sqrt{4-a}, 2 + sqrt{4-a}), and monotonically decreasing on (2 + sqrt{4-a}, +infty). 3. **When a leq 0**, Delta > 0, and the roots are the same as in the previous case. However, x_1 leq 0 and x_2 > 0, leading to: - f'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 2 + sqrt{4-a}, and f'(x) < 0 for x > 2 + sqrt{4-a}. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, 2 + sqrt{4-a}) and monotonically decreasing on (2 + sqrt{4-a}, +infty). In summary: - When a geq 4, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,+infty). - When 0 < a < 4, f(x) has intervals of increase and decrease as described. - When a leq 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing then decreasing. Part (2): Proving f(x_1) + f(x_2) < 7 + e - ln{x_1} - ln{x_2} Given that f(x) has two extreme points x_1 and x_2, we know 0 < a < 4, and from Vieta's formulas, x_1 + x_2 = 4 and x_1x_2 = a. - The sum of f(x_1) and f(x_2) is: [ f(x_1) + f(x_2) = 4(x_1 + x_2) - a(ln{x_1} + ln{x_2}) - frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2) = 8 - a(ln{x_1} + ln{x_2}) - frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 + x_2^2) ] Simplifying using x_1 + x_2 = 4 and x_1x_2 = a, we get: [ f(x_1) + f(x_2) = 8 - aln{a} + a ] - To prove f(x_1) + f(x_2) < 7 + e - ln{x_1} - ln{x_2}, we need to show: [ 8 + a - aln{a} < 7 + e - ln{a} ] Simplifying, we aim to prove: [ 1 + a - aln{a} + ln{a} - e < 0 ] Let m(a) = 1 + a - aln{a} + ln{a} - e. We find m'(a) = 1 - ln{a} + frac{1}{a} and m''(a) = -frac{1}{a^2} - frac{1}{a} < 0, indicating m'(a) is monotonically decreasing. Since m'(1) > 0 and m'(2) < 0, there exists a_0 in (1,2) where m'(a_0) = 0. Thus, m(a) increases then decreases, and its maximum is at a_0. - Evaluating m(a) at its maximum, we find: [ m(a_0) = a_0 + frac{1}{a_0} - e ] Since this expression is less than 0 for a_0 in (1,2), we conclude: [ f(x_1) + f(x_2) < 7 + e - ln{x_1} - ln{x_2} ] Therefore, we have proved the required inequality. boxed{text{The proof is complete.}}"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = ln x ax b.

Testing for simple roots like y=1, we find: 1^3 - 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 0. Thus, y=1 is a root. This suggests that (y-1) is a factor.

Therefore, the angles of the triangle A_1B_1C_1 will relate to the angles of the triangle ABC.

If we consider the usual speed of the train to be 1 (full speed), then the reduced speed is 6/7 of that: Reduced speed = 6/7 * usual speed Since the train is moving slower, it will take longer to complete the journey. The time taken at reduced speed is inversely proportional to the speed of the train.

We can construct a set (A_0) such that (A_0 subseteq S) and (|A_0| = 15) with the numbers in (A_0) being squares of distinct primes. Specifically, [ A_0 = {1, 2^2, 3^2, 5^2, ldots, 41^2, 43^2} ] Here, each element in (A_0) is pairwise coprime (since they are squares of distinct primes), but none of them is a prime number. 2. **Implication**: From the above, we see that if we have only 15 pairwise coprime numbers, we can choose them in such a way that none of them is a prime number. Therefore, we must have (n geq 16). 3. **Proof for (n = 16)**: Now, we need to show that for any subset (A subseteq S) with (|A| = 16) containing pairwise coprime numbers, there must be at least one prime number in (A). **Assumption**: Assume ( A ) contains no prime number. Let ( A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{16}} ) with ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_{16} ). **Case 1**: When (1 notin A) - Since ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{16} ) are all composite numbers and pairwise coprime, each (a_i) must be divisible by at least one distinct prime factor. - Let ( p_i ) be the smallest prime factor of ( a_i ). Clearly, ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{16} ) would be 16 distinct prime numbers. - We know that (2 < 3 < 5 < cdots < 47 < 53). Thus, [ a_1 geq p_1^2 geq 2^2 = 4, quad a_2 geq p_2^2 geq 3^2 = 9, quad ldots, quad a_{15} geq p_{15}^2 geq 47^2 = 2209 ] This implies (a_{15} > 2005), which is a contradiction since all (a_i in S leq 2005). **Case 2**: When (1 in A) - Let (a_{16} = 1) (as 1 is pairwise coprime with all other numbers). - Then the other 15 numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{15}) would be coprime and composite. - Following the same logic as in Case 1 and noting that we need 15 distinct primes for these 15 composites: [ a_1 geq p_1^2 geq 2^2 = 4, quad a_2 geq p_2^2 geq 3^2 = 9, quad ldots, quad a_{14} geq p_{14}^2 geq 43^2 = 1849 ] Again leading to contradictions, as previously shown. Since both cases yield a contradiction, our assumption must be false.

We observe that the inequality (x+2)(x-1) < 0 is satisfied when x is between the roots of (x+2) and (x-1). This implies that: -2 < x < 1 Hence, the solution set for the inequality is the open interval (-2, 1). Therefore, we have: boxed{ (-2, 1) } (2) When m=1, the inequality simplifies to 2 > 0, which is always true. However, for the solution set to be mathbb{R}, the quadratic must have no real roots, which occurs when the discriminant Delta is less than zero. So for m > 1, we require: Delta = (m-1)^2 - 4(m-1)(2) < 0 Simplifying, we get: (m-1)^2 - 8(m-1) < 0 Expanding, we have: m^2 - 2m + 1 - 8m + 8 < 0 Solving for m, we find: m^2 - 10m + 9 < 0 Factoring yields: (m - 1)(m - 9) < 0 The inequality is satisfied for values of m between the roots of (m - 1) and (m - 9).

Therefore, the distance from the center of the ellipse (0,0) to (0,1), which is 1, must be less than or equal to the semi-minor axis. When the foci of the ellipse are on the x-axis, we have m < 5, and according to the problem, we also have m geq 1, which means 1 leq m < 5; When the foci of the ellipse are on the y-axis, we have m > 5, because in this case b= sqrt{5} > 1, so m > 5 meets the requirement of the problem.

Given that there is a unique point P(x,2x) on line l: y = 2x satisfying overrightarrow{PA} + overrightarrow{PB} = overrightarrow{OC}, we can write the following vector equation: (x_{1}-x,y_{1}-2x)+(x_{2}-x,y_{2}-2x)=(-4,a). From the equation, we derive the system of equations: begin{cases} x_{1} + x_{2} - 2x = -4 y_{1} + y_{2} - 4x = a end{cases} This simplifies to: begin{cases} frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} = x - 2 frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2} = 2x - frac{a}{2} end{cases} So, the midpoint M is now at M(x-2, 2x - frac{a}{2}). The distance |CM| then can be calculated as follows: |CM| = sqrt{(x+2)^{2} + left(2x - frac{a}{2}right)^{2}} = sqrt{5}. Upon expanding and rearranging, we get the quadratic equation in terms of x: 5x^{2} + (4 - 2a)x + frac{a^{2}}{4} - 1 = 0. Since there is exactly one such point P on l, the discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation must be zero: (4-2a)^{2} - 20left( frac{a^{2}}{4} - 1right) = 0. Solving this equation gives us two possible values for a: a^{2} + 16a - 36 = 0. The solutions to this quadratic equation are a = 2 or a = -18. Having one point P implies that line l is tangent to the circle at P; thus the line through C that is perpendicular to l goes through P. As the slope of l is 2, and since perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals, the perpendicular has slope -frac{1}{2}. Since C has coordinates (-4,a), this perpendicular is described by the line through C with slope -frac{1}{2}. The line l: y = 2x being tangent to the circle means that it can touch the circle at only one point. The distance from the center of the circle to l is equal to the radius. We could analyze the two values of a found: - For a = 2, when substituting into the equation of line l, we get y = 2x, and so point C has coordinates (-4, 2); this point is not on line l, thus this value cannot correspond to a tangent from C to l. - For a = -18, the center of circle C is (-4, -18) which means that the line with slope -frac{1}{2} will intersect line l in exactly one point because their slopes are indeed negative reciprocals. Therefore, the correct value for a in this problem is (boxed{a = -18})."},{"prompt":"You are trying to cross a 400foot wide river.

The weight of the non-water content in 25 kg of fresh grapes is: 10% of 25 kg = 0.10 * 25 kg = 2.5 kg This 2.5 kg is the weight of the solids (sugars, fibers, vitamins, minerals, etc.) that will remain after drying the grapes.

This means that the weight of the water is 20% of the total weight of the dried grapes, and the weight of the solids is 80% of the total weight of the dried grapes. Let's denote the total weight of the dried grapes as W. So, we have: 80% of W = weight of the solids in dried grapes 20% of W = weight of the water in dried grapes We know the weight of the solids in dried grapes is 2.5 kg (from the fresh grapes), so: 80% of W = 2.5 kg 0.80 * W = 2.5 kg W = 2.5 kg / 0.80 W = 3.125 kg Therefore, the weight of dry grapes available from 25 kg of fresh grapes is boxed{3.125} kg."},{"prompt":"a school of 900 students, 44% wear blue shirts, 28% wear red shirts, 10% wear green shirts, and the remaining students wear other colors.

Since we are subtracting 1203, we know that the last two digits of the result will be 8 - 3 = 5 and (A - 0) = A. So the result will look like 27A5.

The thousands digit in 1022 is 1, and in 27A5 it is 2, so we are already greater by at least 1000. We need to find the smallest A such that the number is still greater than 1022. The hundreds digit in 1022 is 0, and in 27A5 it is 7, so no matter what A is, 27A5 will be greater than 1022 because 2700 is already greater than 1022.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Assumptions:** - Consider a surjective function ( f: mathbf{Z}_{+} to mathbf{Z}_{+} ). - For any two elements ( x, y in mathbf{Z}_{+} ) such that ( x < y ), the set ( {x, y} ) is not sum-free if and only if ( y = 2x ). 2. **Factor Property:** - For any ( x in mathbf{Z}_{+} ), we assume: [ f(2x) = 2f(x) ] - This needs to be true for any ( x ) to follow our assumptions. 3. **Functional Form of ( f ):** - Assume: [ f(x) = 2^{k}a ] where ( a ) is an odd positive integer and ( k in mathbf{Z}_{+} ). We check the validity of this assumption in the context of our problem. 4. **Uniqueness and Surjectivity:** - Consider any non-negative integer ( i ) and choose ( x_{i} in mathbf{Z}_{+} ) satisfying: [ f(x_i) = 2^i a ] Since ( f ) is surjective, such ( x_i ) must exist for all ( i ). 5. **Sum-free Property Verification:** - If ( {x_i, x_{i+1}} ) is a sum-free set, then: [ f({x_i, x_{i+1}}) = {2^i a, 2^{i+1} a} ] If ( {x_i, x_{i+1}} ) is not sum-free, there must be elements such that one element is double the other. Hence, either ( x_i = 2x_{i+1} ) or ( x_{i+1} = 2x_i ). 6. **Recursive Property:** - Since different ( i ) correspond to different ( x_i ), either: [ forall i, , x_i = 2 x_{i+1} quad text{or} quad forall i, , x_{i+1} = 2 x_i ] 7. **Non-feasibility of Certain Sequences:** - If ( x_i = frac{x_0}{2^i} ), for sufficiently large ( i ), this becomes non-feasible. Hence, [ forall i, , x_{i+1} = 2 x_i ] - This implies ( x_i ) cannot exist under the assumption of backward progression. 8. **Injective Property:** - If ( f(x_i') = f(x_i) = 2^i a ), then ( x_i' = frac{x_{i+1}}{2} = x_i ). Therefore the correspondence is unique for each ( x_i ). 9. **Verifying the Hypothesis for Bijectivity:** - Suppose ( f(x) = 2^{k} a ), knowing that ( x ) must be ( x_k ), our function follows the hypothesis correctly. - Since ( x ) values are arbitrary, this determinant ( f ) is indeed injective. 10. **Initial Values and Good Sets:** - ( f(1) = a ), proceed to verify: [ f(n) = an quad forall n in mathbf{Z}_{+} ] 11. **Uniqueness Proof for Specific Values:** - For ( n = 1, 2, 4 ), by induction demonstrates: [ f(n) = a n ] 12. **Composite Elements Evaluation and Final Return:** - For elements like ( n = 3, 5 ): [ f^{-1}(3a) = s, , f^{-1}(5a) = t ] with each having unique properties to maintain good sets. 13. **Verification and Conclusion:** - Demonstrating ( f ) as identity function scaled by ( a ): [ f(x_i') = f(x_i) = 2^{i}a implies x'_i = x_i ] 14. **Final Steps:** - Given function ( f ) is surjective, hence: [ f(n_{0}) = 1 implies n_{0} = 1 text{ gives } a = 1 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{f(n) = n} ]"},{"prompt":"Using the result from the previous problem, prove that the square of the length of the angle bisector of a triangle is equal to the product of the lengths of the sides enclosing it minus the product of the segments of the third side into which the angle bisector divides it.","completion":"To prove: the square of the length of the bisector of a triangle is equal to the product of the lengths of the sides it splits minus the product of the segments of the third side that it divides.

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Assumption and Decomposition:** Assume that the polynomial ( P(x) ) can be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients: [ P(x) = g(x)h(x) ] where (g(x)) and (h(x)) are polynomials with integer coefficients and leading coefficient 1. 2. **Modulus 2 Analysis:** Since (g(x)) and (h(x)) are polynomials over the integers: [ P(x) equiv g(x)h(x) pmod{2} ] We can reduce (P(x)) modulo 2: [ P(x) equiv x^n pmod{2} ] This implies that one of the polynomials, say (g(x)), must be of the form: [ g(x) = x^r + 2 left(b_{r-1}x^{r-1} + cdots + b_0 right) ] and the other polynomial, say (h(x)), must be of the form: [ h(x) = x^{n-r} + 2 left(c_{n-r-1}x^{n-r-1} + cdots + c_0 right) ] where ( 1 leq r < n ) and each (b_i) and (c_i) are integers. 3. **Comparison of Constant Terms:** When comparing the constant term in (P(x)): [ 4 = g(x)h(x) big|_{x=0} = left(2b_0right)left(2c_0right) = 4b_0c_0 ] It follows that ( b_0c_0 = 1/4 ), which is not possible since (b_0) and (c_0) are integers. Hence, there is a contradiction. 4. **Analyzing Leading Terms Coefficient:** Let's consider the coefficients of the leading terms: [ x^n equiv g(x)h(x) pmod{4} ] Expanding and reducing modulo 4, we have: [ g(x)h(x) equiv x^r x^{n-r} = x^n pmod{4} ] which is consistent, but we need to check the other coefficients as well. 5. **Analyzing Degree:** Next, compare the coefficient of (x^{r-1}) once we expand ( g(x) h(x) ): [ g(x) h(x) = x^n + 2 sum_{k=0}^{n}{(b_k c_{n-1-k})x^{k+n-1-k+1}} = x^n+ 4 x^{n-1} +cdots ] 6. **Comparing Non-Leading Terms:** Simplifying, we realize that for (r = n-r), implies (2r=n): [ b_1+c_1 equiv 0 pmod{2} ] It yields: [ x^ {r-1} +8(c_{r-1}+b_{r-1}) ] 7. **Checking Coefficients Modulo 8:** Finally, consider the coefficients of middle terms: [ 4(b_1c_0+c_1b_0) =4 left( b_1+c_1 right) equiv 0 pmod{8} ] Thus, this inconsistency in the coefficients shows contradiction here. 8. **Conclusion:** Since ( P(x) ) cannot be factored in such manner without introducing contradictions, the polynomial: [ x^n + 4x^{n-1} + 4x^{n-2} + cdots + 4x + 4 ] is irreducible over the integers.

The arithmetic square root of 2x+7y+1 being 6 translates to: [ sqrt{2x+7y+1} = 6 ] Squaring both sides to remove the square root gives: [ 2x+7y+1 = 36 ] Simplifying this equation yields: [ 2x + 7y = 35 ] 2. The cube root of 8x+3y being 5 translates to: [ sqrt[3]{8x+3y} = 5 ] Cubing both sides to remove the cube root gives: [ 8x + 3y = 125 ] Now, we have a system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} 2x + 7y = 35 8x + 3y = 125 end{array} right. ] Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: - Multiply the first equation by 4 to make the coefficients of x in both equations equal: [ 8x + 28y = 140 ] - Now subtract the second given equation from this new equation to eliminate x: [ (8x + 28y) - (8x + 3y) = 140 - 125 ] [ 25y = 15 ] [ y = frac{15}{25} = frac{3}{5} ] - Substitute y = frac{3}{5} into one of the original equations to find x: [ 2x + 7left(frac{3}{5}right) = 35 ] [ 2x + frac{21}{5} = 35 ] [ 2x = 35 - frac{21}{5} ] [ 2x = frac{175}{5} - frac{21}{5} ] [ 2x = frac{154}{5} ] [ x = frac{77}{5} ] Therefore, we have found: [ x = frac{77}{5}, quad y = frac{3}{5} ] Adding x and y together gives: [ x + y = frac{77}{5} + frac{3}{5} = frac{80}{5} = 16 ] Finally, the square root of x + y is: [ sqrt{x + y} = sqrt{16} = pm 4 ] Hence, the answer is: boxed{pm 4}."},{"prompt":"Show that there exists a number ( a ) such that ( log_{2} x + log_{3} x = log_{a} x ) holds for all positive ( x ).","completion":"1. To demonstrate that there is a number ( a ) such that ( log_{2} x + log_{3} x = log_{a} x ) holds for every positive ( x ), we start by applying the change of base formula for logarithms: [ log_{b} x = frac{log_{c} x}{log_{c} b} ] 2. Using this change of base formula, we can express ( log_{2} x ) and ( log_{3} x ) in terms of base-10 logarithms (common logarithms): [ log_{2} x = frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 2} ] [ log_{3} x = frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 3} ] 3. Substitute these expressions into the original equation: [ log_{2} x + log_{3} x = frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 2} + frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 3} ] 4. Combine the two terms on the right-hand side: [ frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 2} + frac{log_{10} x}{log_{10} 3} = log_{10} x left( frac{1}{log_{10} 2} + frac{1}{log_{10} 3} right) ] 5.

To resolve for ( a ), coefficient directly correlates logarithmically. So assume equality; Now consider according to inverse property: [ frac{1}{log_{10} 2} + frac{1}{log_{10} 3} = frac{1}{log_{10} a} ] Taking the reciprocals of both sides: [ log_{10} a = frac{log_{10} 2 cdot log_{10} 3}{log_{10} 2 + log_{10} 3} ] 7. Hence, the logarithm base ( 10 ) can now be found with base changing there by evaluation gives: [ log_{10} a = frac{log_{10} 2 cdot log_{10} 3}{log_{10} 2 + log_{10} 3} ] Numerically evaluating: [ log_{10} 2 approx 0.3010 ] [ log_{10} 3 approx 0.4771 ] Substitute these values back in: [ log_{10} a = frac{(0.3010) cdot (0.4771)}{0.3010 + 0.4771} approx frac{0.1436}{0.7781} approx 0.18457 ] 8.

Prove that ( d ) is a multiple of 6.","completion":"1. Recall the problem statement: We need to show that if (a, a+d, a+2d) are all prime numbers larger than 3, then (d) is a multiple of 6. 2. **Observation on Prime Numbers Larger than 3**: - Prime numbers larger than 3 can be represented in the form (6k+1) or (6k+5) (i.e., 1 or 5 modulo 6). This is because any integer (n) can be written as (6k + r) where (r in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}), and only (r = 1) or (r = 5) yields primes larger than 3. 3. **Even Nature of (d)**: - For (a, a+d, a+2d) to all be primes larger than 3, the difference (d) must be even. If (d) were odd, then two consecutive numbers (a) and (a+d) would differ by an odd number, resulting in one of them being even, which cannot be prime except for 2. Therefore, (d) is necessarily even. Let (d = 2k) for some integer (k). 4. **Modulo 6 Analysis**: - Consider the numbers (a, a+d, a+2d). Each of these must fit the form (6m+1) or (6m+5). We have three cases to consider based on the possible forms of (a mod 6). 5. **Case Work**: - **Case 1**: (a equiv 1 pmod{6}) - If (a equiv 1 pmod{6}), then: [ a = 6m + 1 ] - Then (a + d = 6m + 1 + d) should also be a prime number: [ a + d = 6m + 1 + 2k ] - Similarly, (a + 2d = 6m + 1 + 4k) should also be a prime number: [ a + 2d = 6m + 1 + 4k ] - Since both (a+d) and (a+2d) must also be of the form (6n+1) or (6n+5), the shift must preserve these positions in the modulo 6 system. - **Case 2**: (a equiv 5 pmod{6}) - If (a equiv 5 pmod{6}), then: [ a = 6m + 5 ] - Then (a + d = 6m + 5 + 2k) should also be a prime number: [ a + d = 6m + 5 + 2k ] - Similarly, (a + 2d = 6m + 5 + 4k) should also be a prime number: [ a + 2d = 6m + 5 + 4k ] - As in Case 1, the shift must preserve primes fitting the (6k + 1) or (6k + 5) form. 6. **Conclusion**: - In both cases, for (a + d) and (a + 2d) to remain primes and fit into the necessary forms, (d) must be such that it allows transitions between primes in these modular forms. This leads to the necessity for (d) to be divisible by 6 directly. - Therefore, (d) must be a multiple of 6 to maintain these conditions across all forms.

Therefore, for each natural number ( n ) and ( 1000+n ), only one of these two will have an even digit sum. 4. **Sum of Numbers Less Than 1000**: The sum of all natural numbers from 0 to 999 is calculated as: [ A = 0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + 999 = frac{999 cdot 1000}{2} = 499500 ] 5. **Determining Number of Numbers with Even/Odd Digit Sums**: Numbers with even and odd digit sums among numbers less than 1000 are equally distributed. Given there are 1000 such numbers, half of them (500) will have odd digit sums. 6. **Summing Numbers Between 1000 and 2000**: When considering numbers between 1000 and 2000, the sum of numbers between 0 to 999 is added again but shifted by 1000. 7. **Sum of Specific Numbers**: We then need to subtract the sum of numbers from 1980 to 1999 with even digit sums: [ 1980 + 1982 + 1984 + 1986 + 1988 + 1991 + 1993 + 1995 + 1997 + 1999 = 19895 ] 8. **Final Calculation**: Combining all parts above, the total sum ( S ) is given by adding numeric contributions from smaller parts: [ S = A + 1000 cdot B - C = 499500 + 500000 - 19895 = 979605 ] 9. **Conclusion**: The total sum of all natural numbers less than 1980, where the digits sum to an even number, is: [ boxed{979605} ]"},{"prompt":"Among A, B, and C, three people spent a total of 820 yuan on gifts.

This plane will intersect the sphere in a circle and the cylinder in another circle. The center of the cylinder's circular section in this plane is denoted by O_2, and its radius is R. 3. **Points and Angles:** Let T be the point where the perpendicular from O_2 to the horizontal plane meets it. Let M be the point where the common tangent of the sphere and the cylinder touches the horizontal plane. The point E is the point of tangency on the sphere and cylinder. The angle formed between O_1 (center of the hemisphere), O_2 (center of the cylinder), and the point T on the horizontal plane, denoted as angle O_1 O_2 T, is equal to alpha, same as the angle between O_1, M, and E (denoted as angle O_1 M E), as these are both acute angles formed by perpendicular segments. 4. **Triangle and Cosine Relation:** In the right triangle O_1 O_2 T, the relationship of alpha is given by the cosine of the angle alpha: [ cos alpha = frac{O_1 T}{O_1 O_2} = frac{10}{R + 10} ] 5. **Solving for R:** Rearrange the above equation to solve for R: [ cos alpha = frac{10}{R + 10} ] [ cos alpha (R + 10) = 10 ] [ R cos alpha + 10 cos alpha = 10 ] [ R cos alpha = 10 (1 - cos alpha) ] [ R = frac{10 (1 - cos alpha)}{cos alpha} = frac{10 (1 - cos alpha)}{cos alpha} = frac{10 (1 - cos alpha)}{cos alpha} ] [ R = frac{10 (1 - cos alpha)}{cos alpha} = 10left(frac{1}{cos alpha} - 1right) ] 6. **Specific Case for alpha leq 30^circ:** If alpha = 30^circ: [ cos 30^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Substitute this into our equation for R: [ R = 10 left(frac{1}{cos 30^circ} - 1right) ] [ R = 10 left(frac{1}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} - 1right) ] [ R = 10 left(frac{2}{sqrt{3}} - 1right) ] [ R = 10 left(frac{2 - sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}}right) ] Rationalize by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt{3}: [ R = 10 left(frac{2sqrt{3} - 3}{3}right) ] Simplify: [ R = 10 left(frac{2sqrt{3} - 3}{3}right) = left(2sqrt{3} - 1right) ] 7. **Monotonicity of R:** We need to show that the function R(alpha) = frac{10 (1 - cos alpha)}{cos alpha} is monotonically decreasing for 0 < alpha < 30^circ.

Assume that if one person is acquainted with another, the relationship is mutual. This implies that if person ( A ) knows person ( B ), then person ( B ) also knows person ( A ). Let's consider each person as a vertex in a graph, and each acquaintance as an edge between the vertices. We need to demonstrate that if each edge of an octahedron (a polyhedron with 8 faces) is colored arbitrarily in red or green, then there exists a triangular face of the octahedron where all the edges are the same color. 1. **Establish the Fundamentals**: Each vertex of the octahedron represents a person, and each edge represents an acquaintance. 2. **Vertex Degree and Edge Coloring**: Each vertex (person) is connected to every other vertex, leading to 5 edges incident at each vertex. We seek to show that among these edges, at least three edges must have the same color due to the Pigeonhole Principle. 3. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**: By the Pigeonhole Principle, among the 5 edges incident to a vertex, at least 3 must be the same color (say, green). 4. **Configuration Analysis**: Consider three edges of the same color (we assume green) from a single vertex, forming a triangle. a. **Case 1**: If any two endpoints of these 3 green edges are also connected by a green edge, then the three green edges (those beginning at the common vertex and the edge connecting their endpoints) form a monochromatic green triangle. b. **Case 2**: If no two endpoints of the 3 green edges are connected by a green edge, then the edges connecting these endpoints must all be red (the opposite color). This too forms a necessary configuration: - Since each of these edges is red, and each connects endpoints of the green edges, they form a monochromatic red triangle. # Conclusion: Therefore, in any arbitrary coloring of the edges of an octahedron, there will always exist at least one monochromatic triangle. Thus, either: - There exists three people (vertices) connecting via edges (acquaintances) all in one color implying mutual acquaintance, or - There exists three people with all edges of contrasting color, meaning none of them are acquainted.

This gives us two possible cases: Case 1: B - W = 85 Case 2: W - B = 85 Let's solve for B and W in each case using the total number of tiles: Case 1: B - W = 85 B + W = 95 Adding these two equations, we get: 2B = 180 B = 90 Substituting B back into the total number of tiles equation, we get: 90 + W = 95 W = 5 Case 2: W - B = 85 B + W = 95 Adding these two equations, we get: 2W = 180 W = 90 Substituting W back into the total number of tiles equation, we get: B + 90 = 95 B = 5 In both cases, we have one color with 90 tiles and the other with 5 tiles. Since we need at least one tile of each color in every row and column, the square pattern must have a side length that allows for at least one tile of the minority color in each row or column.

To approach this problem, let's consider the geometric interpretation. We need to find the point on the curve y = -x^2 + 3 ln x that is closest to the line described by the equation y = x + 2. This minimum distance will correspond to the minimum value of our expression. Let (a, b) be the point of tangency on the curve y = -x^2 + 3 ln x with the parallel line to y = x + 2. Since a > 0 (as the domain of ln x is x > 0), the slope of the line tangent to the curve at point (a, b) will be the same as the slope of the line y = x + 2, which is 1. The derivative of y = -x^2 + 3 ln x is: y' = -2x + frac{3}{x}. Setting the derivative equal to the slope of the tangent line (1) gives us: -2a + frac{3}{a} = 1. Solving this for a, we disregard the negative solution a = -frac{3}{2}, as it doesn't fit the condition a > 0. We are left with a = 1. Therefore, the tangency point on the curve is (1, -1^2 + 3 ln 1) = (1, -1). The distance d from this point to the line y = x + 2 is given by the point-to-line distance formula: d = frac{|1 + (-1) + 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|2|}{sqrt{2}} = 2sqrt{2}. Now, to find the minimum value of the expression (a - x)^2 + (a + 2 - y)^2, we essentially need the square of the distance we just calculated, because the expression can be interpreted as the square of the distance from any point (x, y) to the point (a, a + 2). The minimum value then is: (text{Min Value}) = (2sqrt{2})^2 = 8. Thus, the minimum value of (a - x)^2 + (a + 2 - y)^2 is boxed{8}."},{"prompt":"Ted wants to put a certain number of candy bars in each of his 15.0 bags. He needs 75 candy bars to do this.

Our goal is to prove that lines ( X Y ) and ( B C ) are symmetric with respect to line ( P Q ). 3. **Symmetry Implication with Points A and L**: Given that points ( A ) and ( L ) are symmetric with respect to the line ( P Q ), it suffices to establish the equality of certain angles formed by these points and the tangent. 4. **Angle Calculation via External Angle Theorem**: We can use the properties of tangents and external angles in triangles to find the required angles. - The tangent line ( X Y ) at point ( A ) creates an angle with line ( A B ). The angle ( angle X A L ) can be expressed using properties of tangents and triangle angles. - Since ( X Y ) is tangent at ( A ), the angle ( angle X A B ) is equal to the angle ( angle A C B ), due to the property of the tangent making an angle with a chord equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. 5. **Using Angle Addition Property**: Let’s deduce ( angle X A L ): [ angle X A L = angle X A B + angle B A L. ] 6. **Using External Angle Theorem**: Using the external angle theorem of triangle ( A B C ): [ angle B A L = angle A C B + angle C A L. ] 7. **Combining Angles**: Substitute ( angle B A L ) in our earlier expression: [ angle X A L = angle A C B + (angle A C B + angle C A L) ] Simplified, we get: [ angle X A L = angle A C B + angle A C B + angle C A L = 2angle A C B + angle C A L. ] Since ( angle B L A ) is symmetrical due to ( A ) and ( L ), therefore: [ angle X A L = angle B L A. ] 8. **Conclusion**: This established angle equality implies that the circumcircle of triangle ( P L Q ) is tangent to line ( B C ), preserving the tangency by symmetry properties and angle identities.

Since there are 51 other cards (excluding the card itself), and 25 of those are black, the probability that the next card is black is dfrac{25}{51}. 2. **Calculate Expected Value for Each Black Card:** The expected value for each black card to form a pair with the card to its right can be calculated by considering the two possibilities: - The card to the right is black, which happens with a probability of dfrac{25}{51}, contributing 1 to the count of black pairs. - The card to the right is red, which happens with a probability of dfrac{26}{51}, contributing 0 to the count of black pairs.

If a positive integer ( n ) can be uniquely represented as the sum of an odd number of distinct elements from ( S ), then ( n ) is called clean. Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers that are not clean.","completion":"# Problem Let ( S ) be a non-empty set of positive integers. If a positive integer ( n ) can be uniquely represented as the sum of an odd number of distinct elements from ( S ), then it is called \\"pure\\". Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers that are not pure. 1. **Definition of Pure and Odd Representation:** Let us define an integer's \\"odd\\" or \\"even\\" representation as a sum of an odd or even number of distinct elements from ( S ). 2. **Assume the Conclusion is False:** Suppose there are only a finite number of positive integers that are not pure. Therefore, there exists a positive integer ( N ) such that every positive integer ( n ) where ( n > N ) has exactly one odd representation. 3. **Property 1: Unique Representations:** Every positive integer ( n ) has at most one odd representation and at most one even representation. - **Proof of Property 1:** Since ( S ) is infinite, there exists an element ( x in S ) such that ( x > max {n, N} ). Thus, the integer ( n + x ) must be pure, and ( x ) will not appear in any even representation of ( n ). If ( n ) were to have more than one even representation, then ( n+x ) would have more than one odd representation, creating a contradiction. Consequently, ( n ) can have at most one even representation. 4. **Existence of Elements Greater than ( x ) in ( S ):** Similarly, if there are two distinct elements ( y, z in S ) such that ( y, z > max {n, N} ), and if ( n ) had more than one odd representation, then ( n+y+z ) obtained by adding ( y ) and ( z ) to both representations would necessarily create more than one odd representation for ( n+y+z ), which contradicts our earlier assumption. 5. **Property 2: Representation Involving ( s in S ):** For a fixed ( s in S ), if a positive integer ( n (n > N) ) doesn't have an even representation, then for all integer ( a ), ( n+2as ) has an odd representation that includes ( s ). - **Proof of Property 2:** We need only show the following principle: if ( n ) lacks an even representation excluding ( s ), then ( n+2s ) includes ( s ). This claim follows from Property 1, as such ( n ) has no even representation excluding ( s ). When ( s ) is added, the resulting ( n+2s ) necessarily includes ( s ) in its unique odd representation. 6. **Property 3: Large Enough Integers:** Any sufficiently large integer has an even representation. - **Proof of Property 3:** If we fix any ( s in S ), consider the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 2s} ). According to Property 2, within the set: [ mathbf{Z}_r = {r + 2as mid a in mathbf{Z}, a geqslant 0}, ] each element ( r ) must have an even representation for sufficiently large numbers. This holds across ( mathbf{Z} ), implying all integers in ( mathbf{Z}_+ ) eventually have even representations. 7. **Property 4: Pure Representations for Elements in ( S ):** For any two elements ( s, t in S ) with ( N < s < t ), the even representation of ( t ) includes ( s ). - **Proof of Property 4:** Assume the conclusion does not hold. Then for integer ( s + t ), two different odd representations exist: one by adding ( t ) to an even representation of ( s ) and another from an even representation of ( t ). These would contradict each other as the odd representations are supposed to be unique by properties of unique representation established earlier. 8. **Establishing Contradictions:** Begin by arranging ( s_1 < s_2 < ldots ) within ( S ). And fix ( k ) such that ( s_k > N ). Using these contradictions and logical deductions from properties, if for any positive integer ( j_0 > k ), ( sigma_{j_0} > 2sigma_{k-1} ), and ensuring [ s_{j+1} geq frac{sigma_j}{2}. ] Any repeated element ( s_p ) coherently demonstrates that if ( 2s_p > s_1 + s_2 + ldots + s_{p-1} ), ( tau ) (odd representation) includes some number greater than ( s_{p-1} ), there exists large enough integers that are always pure only once, thereby contradicting fundamentally proving large infinite integers not purely representing. # Conclusion: It follows from properties and contradictions established consistently that there indeed exist infinitely many integers that are not pure.

This product generally results in a rotation centered at some point (O), which can be determined given point (M) and lines (l_2, l_3, ldots, l_n). - Thus, for odd (n), the problem has a unique solution unless the rotation is a parallel shift or the identity transformation, where it is either unsolvable or indeterminate with infinite solutions. - For even (n): The task reduces to finding the fixed point of a product of an odd number of reflections.

If it results in symmetry about a line, the problem has infinite solutions along that line. - For odd (n), this results in a product that typically yields a rotation; hence, the problem does not have consistent solutions unless the rotations align. Conclusion: Part a: 1. If (n) is odd, the problem has a unique result generally or no solution if it results in a parallel shift or identity transformation. 2. If (n) is even, the solution is generally unsolvable except for cases where specific alignments provide definite or infinite solutions along specific lines. Part b: 1. If (n) is even, the problem has a unique result generally or infinite outcomes along a line. 2. If (n) is odd, the task results in rotation making it unsolvable unless special alignments arise. Thus, summarizing: - Part a: The unique solution when (n) is odd, generally. - Part b: The unique solution when (n) is even or possibly infinite along specific lines.

Program A must be in one of the first three positions. 2. Programs B and C must be together. First, we treat Programs B and C as a single unit since they must be together. This effectively reduces our problem to arranging 5 units (the combined BC unit and the other 4 programs). For Program A, there are 3 choices for its position. For the combined BC unit and the other 4 programs, we have 5 units to arrange in total. The number of ways to arrange these 5 units is 5! = 120. However, within the BC unit, B and C can switch places, adding another factor of 2 to our total arrangements. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is 3 times 120 times 2 = 720. But, this answer is not listed in the options, indicating a mistake in the calculation. Re-evaluating the constraints and the calculation process, the correct approach is: 1.

The number of ways to choose 4 disks out of 8 to paint blue is binom{8}{4}. After choosing 4 disks for blue, we choose 3 out of the remaining 4 disks to paint red, which can be done in binom{4}{3} ways. The last disk will automatically be green. The calculation is: [ binom{8}{4} cdot binom{4}{3} = 70 cdot 4 = 280 ] Step 2: Identify the symmetries of the octagon. The symmetries of a regular octagon include: - 1 identity transformation, - 4 reflections across lines through opposite vertices, - 4 reflections across lines through midpoints of opposite sides, - 3 rotations (90°, 180°, 270°). Step 3: Count the fixed points for each symmetry. 1. **Identity transformation**: 280 fixed points. 2. **Reflections across vertices and midpoints (similar calculations)**: - Each reflection has disks pairwise needing same colors, with several options depending on how the disks align with the colors. Typically, this results in binom{4}{2} binom{2}{1} times 2 fixed points for each, simplifying to 6 times 2 = 12 fixed points per reflection. 3. **Rotations**: - **90° and 270° rotations**: No fixed points, as no color repetition layout allows these rotations. - **180° rotation**: Disks opposite each other must be the same color, leading to binom{4}{2} binom{2}{1} times 2 = 12 fixed points. Step 4: Apply Burnside's Lemma.

The parabola is symmetric about this axis. 2. **Increasing on the Left Side of the Axis of Symmetry**: For the parabola to be increasing on the left side, as we move from left to right (towards the axis of symmetry), the y-values must be increasing. This behavior is characteristic of a parabola that opens downwards. 3. **Relation to Coefficient a**: The direction in which a parabola opens is determined by the sign of the coefficient a in the equation y = ax^2. - If a > 0, the parabola opens upwards. - If a < 0, the parabola opens downwards. 4. **Conclusion**: Since we are given that the parabola is increasing on the left side of the axis of symmetry, it must open downwards.

We know from the properties of parallelograms that in a quadrilateral KLMN all vertices are aligned such that the diagonals KM and LN intersect at their common midpoint T. 4. Consider the plane alpha passing through point T and perpendicular to AX. Since KM parallel AX, all points in this plane alpha are equidistant from points K and M. 5. Since T is the midpoint of LN, points L and N are equidistant from the plane alpha and lie on opposite sides (or both lie exactly in alpha). 6. Since the segments O_{1}N and O_{2}L are perpendicular to AX, they are parallel to alpha.

Then the inequality becomes: [ frac{1}{1 + ab} leq frac{1}{1 + a} + frac{1}{1 + b} ] 4. **Simplify the LHS and RHS**: Simplify the right-hand side (RHS): [ frac{1}{1 + a} + frac{1}{1 + b} ] Common denominate between the two fractions on the RHS: [ frac{(1 + b) + (1 + a)}{(1 + a)(1 + b)} = frac{2 + a + b}{(1 + a)(1 + b)} ] Therefore, we need to show: [ frac{1}{1 + ab} leq frac{2 + a + b}{(1 + a)(1 + b)} ] 5. **Comparison of Terms**: Rearrange our target inequality: [ frac{2 + a + b}{(1 + a)(1 + b)} - frac{1}{1 + ab} geq 0 ] Find a common denominator: [ frac{(2 + a + b)(1 + ab) - (1 + ab)(1 + a)(1 + b)}{(1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + ab)} geq 0 ] 6. **Simplify the Numerator**: Expand and simplify the numerator: [ (2 + a + b)(1 + ab) - (1 + ab)(1 + a)(1 + b) ] Expand both products: [ (2 + a + b + 2ab + a^2b + ab^2) - (1 + a + b + ab)(1 + ab) ] Further expand: [ (2 + a + b + 2ab + a^2b + ab^2) - (1 + ab + a + a^2b + b + ab^2) ] Simplify by canceling like terms: [ 2 + ab geq 1 ] This is true for all positive (a) and (b). Therefore, the function [ f(x) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} ] satisfies [ f(x+y) leq f(x) + f(y) ] for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ), and is strictly increasing. # Conclusion: [ boxed{f(x) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}} ]"},{"prompt":"a race where 12 cars are running , the chance that car x will win is 1 / 6 , that y will win is 1 / 10 and that z will win is 1 / 8 . assuming that a dead heat is impossible , find the chance that one of them will win .","completion":"To find the probability that one of the three cars (X, Y, or Z) will win, we can add their individual probabilities together.

Since the minute hand moves 6° per minute and the hour hand moves 0.5° per minute, the difference in their speeds is 6 - 0.5 = 5.5° per minute.

Then, we can construct an equation with n as the variable based on _{a_n}=201 and solve the equation to find the answer. **Step-by-Step Solution** 1. Since _{a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common difference by d. 2. We know that _{a_5}=33 and _{a_{45}}=153. Using the formula for the general term of an arithmetic sequence, _{a_n} = a_1 + (n - 1)d, we can write a system of two linear equations: begin{cases} a_5 = a_1 + 4d = 33 a_{45} = a_1 + 44d = 153 end{cases} 3.

Using the distance formula, we get: [ XA = sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + a)^2 + (z + a)^2} ] [ XB = sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2 + (z - a)^2} ] [ XC = sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + a)^2 + (z - a)^2} ] [ XD = sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - a)^2 + (z + a)^2} ] 3. **Sum of the Squared Distances**: Compute the sum of the squared distances from the point (X) to the tetrahedron vertices: [ XA^2 = (x + a)^2 + (y + a)^2 + (z + a)^2 ] [ XB^2 = (x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2 + (z - a)^2 ] [ XC^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y + a)^2 + (z - a)^2 ] [ XD^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y - a)^2 + (z + a)^2 ] Summing these: [ XA^2 + XB^2 + XC^2 + XD^2 = sum_{V in {A, B, C, D}} XV^2 ] Expanding and combining like terms: [ XA^2 + XB^2 + XC^2 + XD^2 = sum_{V in {A, B, C, D}} left( (x pm a)^2 + (y pm a)^2 + (z pm a)^2 right) ] Simplifying we get: [ XA^2 + XB^2 + XC^2 + XD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 4(3a^2) ] This simplifies to: [ XA^2 + XB^2 + XC^2 + XD^2 = 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 12a^2 ] 4. **Using the QM-AM Inequality**: The QM-AM inequality for distances states that the sum of distances is less than or equal to the square root of the sum of squared distances multiplied by the number of terms.

Therefore, we have f(-x) = -f(x). - Setting x = 3 in the given functional equation f(x) = f(6-x) + f(3), we find f(3) = 0.

The original area of the trapezoid can be represented as A_0 = frac{(a + b) times 4}{2}. After increasing both bases by 6 cm, the new lengths become a + 6 and b + 6. Therefore, the new area becomes A_1 = frac{(a + 6 + b + 6) times 4}{2}. Now, we are interested in finding the difference between the new area A_1 and the original area A_0. This represents the increase in area: A_1 - A_0 = frac{(a + 6 + b + 6) times 4}{2} - frac{(a + b) times 4}{2} Expanding the expression above, we get: A_1 - A_0 = frac{a + 6 + b + 6}{2} times 4 - frac{a + b}{2} times 4 A_1 - A_0 = (a + b + 12) times 2 - (a + b) times 2 A_1 - A_0 = 2a + 2b + 24 - 2a - 2b A_1 - A_0 = 24 So, the area increases by 24 square cm.

This would simply be 6! (6 factorial), because the first position can be filled by any of the 6 people, the second position by any of the remaining 5, and so on, giving us: 6! = 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 720 Now, let's calculate the number of arrangements where persons A and B are next to each other. We can treat person A and person B as a single unit. This unit, along with the 4 remaining people, amounts to 5 units that can be arranged in 5! ways. Since A and B can be either AB or BA within their unit, we need to multiply 5! by 2 for the different arrangements of A and B, obtaining: 2 times 5! = 2 times (5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1) = 240 Next, we compute the number of arrangements where person A or B is at one of the ends. This means person A or B has 2 choices for an end position, and the remaining 5 people (including either A or B, whoever is not on an end) can be arranged in 5! ways. So, we have: 2 times 5! = 240 However, since there are two people, A and B, and each could be at an end, this number should be doubled. That's another 240 times 2 = 480 invalid arrangements. If we subtract the 240 arrangements where A and B are next to each other and the 480 arrangements where A or B is at the end from the total number of arrangements, we get the number of valid arrangements where A and B are not next to each other and neither is at the end: 6! - 2 times 5! - 2 times 2 times 5! = 720 - 240 - 480 = 720 - 720 = 0 It seems we have made a mistake as the result cannot be 0. We need to correct the error by noting that in counting the cases where A or B is at one of the ends, some arrangements where A and B are next to each other have been counted twice: once when A is at the end and once when B is at the end. So, we need to add those back in. Specifically, each counted-twice arrangement consists of 2 positions filled by A and B in some order (2 choices), and 4 positions filled by the remaining people in 4! ways. Since there are 2 ends on our row, the number of doubly-counted arrangements is: 2 times 2 times 4! = 4 times 24 = 96 We subtract the 240 arrangements for A and B together, subtract the 480 arrangements where A or B is at an end, and add back the 96 doubly-counted arrangements: 6! - 2 times 5! - 2 times 2 times 5! + 2 times 2 times 4! = 720 - 240 - 480 + 96 = 720 - 624 = 96 Therefore, there are boxed{96} valid arrangements where persons A and B are not next to each other and neither is at either end of the row."},{"prompt":"Given point ( A ) is a point inside a unit circle centered at ( O ), satisfying ( |overrightarrow{OA}| = frac{1}{2} ).

This confirms that option A is a sufficient condition for option B. **Part 2: Proving Option A is a Necessary Condition for Option B** Assuming {frac{S_{n}}{n}} is an arithmetic progression, we can denote the constant difference by D, such that: [frac{S_{n+1}}{n+1} - frac{S_{n}}{n} = D.] This implies that: [frac{S_{n}}{n} = S_{1} + (n-1)D.] From this, we can express S_{n} as: [S_{n} = nS_{1} + n(n-1)D.] For n geqslant 2, we have: [S_{n-1} = (n-1)S_{1} + (n-1)(n-2)D.] Subtracting these two equations to find a_{n}, we get: [a_{n} = S_{n} - S_{n-1} = S_{1} + 2(n-1)D.] For n=1, this equation holds true, showing that a_{n} = a_{1} + 2(n-1)D, which implies {a_{n}} is an arithmetic progression. Therefore, option A is a necessary condition for option B. **Conclusion** Since option A is both a sufficient and necessary condition for option B, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"n coins are simultaneously flipped.

This number ( a ) represents the frequency of appearance of a particular number from the line above. - The number appearing ( a ) times on the original line must also induce the number ( a ) to appear at least ( a ) times on the new line created below it. 3. **Properties of each column**: - If we observe any given column of numbers formed through this process, except for the first row, the entries in the columns will be in non-decreasing order. - Why? Because the count of occurrences (a natural number) is consistently updated in a way that respects the ordering. - This implies if you start with some number ( n ), and through multiple iterations, you end up with a number ( leq n ) appearing the same or more times due to the nature of re-counting. 4. **Sum of elements constraint**: - Note that each new line formed still sums up to 2018 numbers. This is crucial because it constrains the progression of changes across lines. - Mathematically, if each line's numbers differed without bound, their sum of the counts would necessarily exceed 2018. Since this cannot happen, there are limits on possible variations. 5. **Convergence to stability**: - Initially, suppose that each new line is different. If each line were guaranteed to be different indefinitely, the sum of numbers would increasingly defer from 2018 due to persistent changes. - Thus, given the finite sum restriction, the lines must eventually stabilize. 6. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, after a finite number of iterations, the lines must become identical because the variations exhaust all possibilities without exceeding the finite sum constraint.

Firstly, consider the equation: [ (x+8)(x-4) = 4^y ] Suppose (x+8) and (x-4) are both powers of 2. Let (x+8 = 2^n) and (x-4 = 2^m) where (m, n in mathbb{Z}). Then we have: [ 2^n - 2^m = 12 ] 3.

Next, consider the case when (x+8 = -2^n) and (x-4 = -2^m): [ 2^m - 2^n = 12 ] 6. Since (x < -8), we have: [ -8 - 2^n < -8 implies n geq 0 ] And: [ 4 - 2^m < -8 implies m geq 4 ] 7. The solution for the equation (2^m - 2^n = 12): [ 2^m - 2^n = 12 ] Let (m = 4), then: [ n = 2 ] This results in (x): [ x + 8 = -2^4 implies x + 8 = -16 implies x = -24 ] And: [ x - 4 = -2^2 implies x - 4 = -4 implies x = 0 ] So, the second solution is (x = -12): [ y_2 = 3, x_2 = -12 ] 8.

Show that if the subring generated by I cup {1} is R for each nonzero ideal I then R is simple.","completion":"To show that ( R ) is simple, we need to prove that ( R ) has no non-trivial two-sided ideals. We will proceed by contradiction and use the given condition that the subring generated by ( I cup {1} ) is ( R ) for each nonzero ideal ( I ). 1. **Assume ( R ) is not simple**: Suppose ( R ) has a non-trivial ideal ( I ) such that ( 0 subsetneq I subsetneq R ). 2. **Direct sum decomposition**: If ( R ) can be decomposed as a direct sum of nonzero rings ( A oplus B ), then ( A ) and ( B ) must be cyclic by considering ( I = B ) and ( I = A ) respectively and applying the given condition. This contradicts the non-commutativity of ( R ). 3. **Finite ring structure**: Since ( R ) is finite, it can be decomposed into a direct sum of its ( p )-subrings using Bezout's lemma. Given that ( R ) is indecomposable, its order must be ( p^k ) for some ( k ). 4. **Jacobson radical**: Let ( J(R) ) be the Jacobson radical of ( R ). Since ( R ) is finite, it is Artinian, and thus ( R/J(R) ) is semisimple. If ( J(R) = 0 ), then ( R ) is simple because an Artinian ring with a trivial radical is simple. 5. **Case when ( J(R) neq 0 )**: If ( J(R) neq 0 ), then ( 1 ) generates ( R/J(R) ), making ( R/J(R) ) a cyclic field ( mathbb{F}_p ). Thus, ( J(R) ) is the unique maximal ideal of ( R ), making ( R ) a finite local ring. 6. **Properties of ( J(R) )**: Note that ( p in J(R) ). For any ( k ) such that ( J(R)^k neq 0 ), ( R/(J(R)^k) ) is cyclic by the problem condition. If ( p in J(R)^2 ), then ( J(R) = J(R)^2 ) because both would give ( mathbb{F}_p ) when we quotient ( R ) by them. However, for Artinian rings ( R ), any right ( R )-module ( M ) satisfies ( M cdot J(R) = text{rad}(M) ). Thus, ( J(R)^2 = text{rad}(J(R)) ). 7. **Contradiction**: Since ( J(R) ) is finite and Noetherian, it has a proper maximal submodule, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( p in J(R) - J(R)^2 ). 8. **Ideal structure**: We claim ( (p) = J(R) ). By the problem condition, ( R/(p) ) is cyclic unless ( p = 0 ), in which case ( J(R) = 0 ) and ( R ) is the field ( mathbb{F}_p ). Since every element of ( R/(p) ) has order ( p ), we have ( R/(p) = R/J(R) = mathbb{F}_p ), and ( (p) subseteq J(R) ), so the ideals are equal. 9. **Cyclic structure**: Each ( R/(p^k) ) is cyclic for all ( k ) such that ( (p^k) neq 0 ). If ( (p^{k+1}) neq 0 ), then ( (p^k) neq text{rad}(p^k) = (p^{k+1}) ). If ( q ) is the smallest positive integer for which ( p^q = 0 ), we can inductively show that for all ( n < q ), ( R/(p^n) = mathbb{Z}/(p^n)mathbb{Z} ). 10. **Contradiction in ideal structure**: If ( (p^{q-1}) ) has ( k ) elements, then ( R ) has ( p^{q-1} cdot k ) elements, and ( 1 ) has order ( p^q ). For any nonzero ideal ( U ) satisfying ( 0 < U < (p^{q-1}) ), we have ( R/U = mathbb{Z}/(p^q)mathbb{Z} ). Distinct ideals ( U_1 ) and ( U_2 ) must be disjoint, leading to ( U_1 + U_2 = (p^{q-1}) ). If two distinct such ideals exist, we have ( k^2/p^2 = k ), implying ( k = p^2 ). This would make ( R ) commutative, contradicting the non-commutativity of ( R ). 11. **Conclusion**: There exists at most one ideal between ( (p^{q-1}) ) and ( 0 ). The ideals of ( R ) form a linear total order under inclusion if ( J(R) neq 0 ). If ( J(R) ) is nonzero, ( R ) is an algebra on a free ( mathbb{Z}/(p^q)mathbb{Z} ) module with basis ( 1, b_1, ldots, b_m ). If the set ( b_i ) is nonempty, ( (p) = (mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^{1+m} ) where ( m > 0 ), contradicting that ( R/(p) = R/J(R) = mathbb{F}_p ) is a cyclic field. Thus, ( R = mathbb{Z}/(p^q)mathbb{Z} ) if ( J(R) ) is nonzero, contradicting the non-commutativity of ( R ). 12. **Final conclusion**: Therefore, ( J(R) = 0 ), and since ( R ) is Artinian with a trivial radical and is indecomposable, ( R ) is simple.

Substitute ( ND ) back into the ratio expression: [ frac{S_{AMND}}{S_{BMNC}} = frac{a + 2left(frac{a - 2a cot alpha}{2}right)}{3a - 2left(frac{a - 2a cot alpha}{2}right)} = frac{a + a - 2a cot alpha}{3a - a + 2a cot alpha} = frac{2a - 2a cot alpha}{2a + 2a cot alpha} = frac{1 - cot alpha}{1 + cot alpha} ] 8. Rewrite the ratio in terms of the tangent function: [ frac{1 - cot alpha}{1 + cot alpha} = frac{tan alpha - 1}{tan alpha + 1} ] Using the tangent subtraction formula, [ frac{tan alpha - tan frac{pi}{4}}{1 + tan alpha tan frac{pi}{4}} = tan left( alpha - frac{pi}{4} right) ] 9.

Assuming an equal number of bulk and individual pack sales, what is the difference in net revenue (total sales minus the commissions) in a day between the peak season and the low season?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total sales for both the peak season and the low season. **Peak Season:** - Packs sold per hour: 8 - Price per pack: 70 - Hours of sales: 17 - Total packs sold: 8 packs/hour * 17 hours = 136 packs - Total sales without discount: 136 packs * 70/pack = 9,520 Assuming an equal number of bulk (4 or more packs) and individual pack sales, half of the sales will be eligible for the discount. - Packs sold with discount: 136 packs / 2 = 68 packs - Discount per pack: 10% of 70 = 7 - Total discount: 68 packs * 7/pack = 476 - Total sales with discount: 9,520 - 476 = 9,044 Salespeople commission: - Commission rate: 5% - Total commission: 5% of 9,044 = 452.20 Net revenue for peak season: - Net revenue: 9,044 - 452.20 = 8,591.80 **Low Season:** - Packs sold per hour: 5 - Price per pack: 50 - Hours of sales: 14 - Total packs sold: 5 packs/hour * 14 hours = 70 packs - Total sales without discount: 70 packs * 50/pack = 3,500 Assuming an equal number of bulk (4 or more packs) and individual pack sales, half of the sales will be eligible for the discount. - Packs sold with discount: 70 packs / 2 = 35 packs - Discount per pack: 7% of 50 = 3.50 - Total discount: 35 packs * 3.50/pack = 122.50 - Total sales with discount: 3,500 - 122.50 = 3,377.50 Salespeople commission: - Commission rate: 3% - Total commission: 3% of 3,377.50 = 101.32 Net revenue for low season: - Net revenue: 3,377.50 - 101.32 = 3,276.18 **Difference in net revenue between peak season and low season:** - Difference: 8,591.80 (peak) - 3,276.18 (low) = 5,315.62 The difference in net revenue in a day between the peak season and the low season is boxed{5,315.62} ."},{"prompt":"The cost of 1 melon is 3.

The universal set is given by U={1,2,3,4}. The complement of a set X with respect to U is a set of elements that are in U but not in X. Therefore, to find the complement of A cup B with respect to U, we need to find all elements in U that are not in A cup B: complement_U (A cup B) = {x in U : x notin A cup B} = {4}.

Step 1: Compare 2009^{2010} and 2010^{2009} - Note that 2009 < 2010, and since the bases are very close, the exponents play a significant role in determining the size. - Given the property that if a < b and n > m, then a^n < b^m might not necessarily hold, we need to dig deeper. To compare 2009^{2010} and 2010^{2009}, let's use the natural logarithm to simplify: [ ln(2009^{2010}) = 2010 cdot ln(2009) ] [ ln(2010^{2009}) = 2009 cdot ln(2010) ] Since 2010 is very close to 2009, we can assume ln(2010) approx ln(2009), but 2010 > 2009 thus: [ 2009 cdot ln(2010) > 2010 cdot ln(2009) ] Therefore, [ 2010^{2009} > 2009^{2010} ] So, amongst (A) and (C), (C) is larger. Step 2: Analyze 20092010^{2} Next, compare 20092010^2 with 2010^{2009}: [ 20092010^2 = 2009 cdot 2010^2 ] This is much smaller because: [ 2009 cdot 2010^2 ll 2010^{2009} ] Thus, option (B) is smaller compared to (C). Step 3: Evaluate 2^{10} + 4^{10} + cdots + 2010^{10} Sum the terms and compare with 2010^{2009}: [ 2^{10} + 4^{10} + ldots + 2010^{10} leq 2010 cdot 2010^{10} = 2010^{11} quad (text{since 2010^{10} is the largest term}) ] Clearly, [ 2010^{11} ll 2010^{2009} ] Thus, (E) is also smaller compared to (C). Step 4: Analyze 3^{(3^{a^3})} Compare 3^{(3^{a^3})} with 2010^{2009}: If a = 2 as suggested, we get: [ 3^{(3^{2^3})} = 3^{(3^8)} = 3^{6561} ] Since: [ 3^7 > 2010 ] Therefore, [ 3^{6561} gg 2010^{2009} ] As calculated, [ left(3^7right)^{left(3^7right)} = 3^{49 cdot 3^7} ] Due to exponential growth properties, 3^{(3^{a^3})} becomes extremely large. # Conclusion: From the detailed steps, it’s clear that option (D) 3^{(3^{a^3})} when a=2, is the largest number among the provided options.
