We need to find the length of the external tangent between them, given that the tangents between the points of tangency form a right angle. 2. **Geometric Construction**: Consider the points of tangency on each circle where the external tangents touch. Let these points be A and B on the circle with radius R, and C and D on the circle with radius r, where A is tangent to C and B to D. 3. **Square Properties**: For each of the circles, the quadrilateral formed by the radii at the points of tangency and the tangents at these points is a square. This is because the radii are perpendicular to the tangents and both tangents at each point create right angles with the radii. 4. **Square Sides**: The side lengths of these squares are the radii R and r, respectively. 5. **Tangent Length Calculation**: - Since the tangents create a right angle, consider the entire setup as forming two right-angled triangles joined back-to-back with hypotenuses equal to R + r (distance between the centers of the circles). - The length L of each external tangent (the part we wish to find) can be related by the Pythagorean theorem, considering the total distance between the points of tangency. 6. **Applying Pythagorean Theorem**: - Using Pythagorean theorem directly between the distance between the circle centers, the external tangents, and the hypotenuses of the squares: [ L = sqrt{(R + r)^2 - (R - r)^2} ] - Simplifying this: [ L = sqrt{(R + r)^2 - (R - r)^2} = sqrt{(R^2 + 2Rr + r^2) - (R^2 - 2Rr + r^2)} = sqrt{4Rr} = 2sqrt{Rr} ] 7. **Resulting Length**: Therefore, the length of the external tangents between the circles can be given by: [ L = 2sqrt{Rr} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{2sqrt{Rr}} ]"},{"prompt":"A fair 8sided die is rolled.

When both pumps work together, they fill the pool in 5 hours. The combined rate of both pumps is 1 pool per 5 hours, or (S + F) = 1/5 pools per hour. We can express F in terms of S: F = (1/5) - S. Since we know S = 1/12.5, we can substitute this into the equation for F: F = (1/5) - (1/12.5). To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which would be 5 * 12.5 = 62.5.

The purpose of this step is to use the properties of a triangle formed by the perpendicular from the midpoint of the hypotenuse. - By drawing this perpendicular, triangle ADE is created, which is right at D.

In this case, 3 + 3 = 6, which is not greater than 10. Therefore, a triangle with these dimensions cannot exist. # Step 2: Analyzing the second configuration - Now, let's consider the case where the length of one of the sides is 3 units, and this is not one of the two equal sides. This means the 3 units side is the base. - In an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides must have the same length. We can calculate the length of these sides by first subtracting the base length from the total perimeter and then dividing by 2: dfrac{1}{2} times (16 - 3) = dfrac{1}{2} times 13 = 6.5 units. - In this configuration, we have two sides of 6.5 units each and one side of 3 units. This does satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, as 6.5 + 6.5 > 3, and thus, a triangle can be formed. # Conclusion Given the conditions, the only valid configuration for the isosceles triangle results in the other sides being 6.5 units long.

If Petya is lying, both statements (i) and (ii) he made are false. - Statement (i) about numbers being consecutive is false. - Consequently, statement (ii) about the sum being even is also false. 4. **Analyze Vasya's Statements:** - Vasya claims: (i) These numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and (ii) Kolya is a liar. 5. If Petya is lying, the numbers 1 to 6 can’t be the correct set since they’re consecutive. This means: - Vasya’s first statement is false. - Thus Vasya must be lying too (because consecutive numbers were claimed, which we know can't be true). 6. **Analyze Kolya's Statements:** - Kolya claims: (i) All these numbers are distinct and divisible by 3, and (ii) Each of these numbers is less than 20. - Since Vasya is lying about Kolya being a liar, Kolya must be telling the truth. - Check Kolya’s statements: - There are exactly six multiples of 3 less than 20: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. - These numbers are distinct and all are indeed divisible by 3. - Each of these numbers is less than 20. - Thus, Kolya’s statements are true verifying this set is ( {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18} ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18} ]"},{"prompt":"a parallelogram , the length of one diagonal and the perpendicular dropped on that diagonal are 30 and 20 metres respectively . find its are","completion":"To find the area of the parallelogram using the length of one diagonal and the perpendicular dropped on it, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, since the diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles.

Therefore, we have: [ 4x + 4y + 4z = 24 ] Simplify this equation by dividing everything by 4: [ x + y + z = 6 ] 3. **Surface Area:** The total surface area of the prism is given to be 11. The surface area formula for a rectangular prism is: [ 2xy + 2xz + 2yz = 11 ] 4. **Diagonal of the Prism:** The diagonal AH of the rectangular prism can be determined using the Pythagorean Theorem in three dimensions.

Prove that the points X, Y, and Z are collinear.","completion":"To prove that the points (X), (Y), and (Z) are collinear using inversion, we proceed as follows: 1. **Define the inversion:** Let (k^2) be the power of the inversion with respect to the circle centered at point (X) with a radius (k). This inversion will transform points and circles in a specific way that preserves the property we want to prove. Set (T) as the inversion centered at (X) with radius (k). Therefore: - (T(A) = B) - (T(B) = A) - (T(E) = D) - (T(D) = E) - The circle (O) remains invariant under (T), i.e., (T(odot O) = odot O) 2. **Consider small angle (alpha):** Let (alpha) be a very small angle. Construct circles (Omega_1), (Omega_2), and (Omega_3) such that: - Circle (Omega_1) intersects circle (O) at points (A) and (D), making an angle of (alpha). - Circle (Omega_2) intersects circle (O) at points (B) and (E), also making an angle of (alpha). - Circle (Omega_3) intersects circle (O) at points (C) and (F), also making an angle of (alpha). 3. **Position of points (X), (Y), and (Z):** Notice that points (X), (Y), and (Z) lie outside circle (O). When the angle (alpha) is very small, circles (Omega_1), (Omega_2), and (Omega_3) nearly coincide with circle (O). Consequently, we can always choose a sufficiently small angle (alpha) so that points (X), (Y), and (Z) lie outside circles (Omega_1), (Omega_2), and (Omega_3). 4. **Inversion properties:** By the inversion properties, specifically: [ (odot O) cap (odot Omega_1) = {A, D} text{ with angle } alpha ] Under the inversion (T): - The circle (Omega_1) transforms into another circle, and its intersection points with (odot O) transform as: [ [T(A) = B] text{ and } [T(D) = E] ] Since the circle (odot O) under inversion remains the same, we have: [ T(odot Omega_1) = odot Omega_2 ] Thus, point (X) must be the intersection of the radical axes of circles (Omega_1) and (Omega_2). 5. **Connecting the intersections:** - Similarly, point (Y) is the intersection of the radical axes of circles (Omega_1) and (Omega_3). - Point (Z) is the intersection point of the radical axes of circles (Omega_2) and (Omega_3). 6. **Radical axis theorem:** By the Radical Axis Theorem, the radical axes of any three circles intersect at one common point if each pairwise radical axis meets.

The angle at the center for each sector, since the cake is cut into four pieces, is frac{360^circ}{4} = 90^circ.

This means that ( 2^n equiv -1 pmod{n} ), or equivalently, ( 2^{2n} equiv 1 pmod{n} ). This implies that the order of 2 modulo ( n ) must divide ( 2n ). 3. **Prime Divisors:** We need ( n ) to have exactly 2000 prime divisors.

This is a key step in building ( n ) inductively. 5. **Base Case:** We start with ( n = 9 ). For ( n = 9 ), we have ( 2^9 + 1 = 513 ).

Our goal is to show that there exists an equilateral triangle whose vertices are all the same color. 2. Consider an equilateral hexagon (a regular hexagon) in the plane. Let's denote this hexagon as (ABCDEF), where (A, B, C, D, E, F) are the vertices of the hexagon. 3. Suppose we color the center of the hexagon white. This divides our problem into analyzing the color distribution among the vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F). 4. Let's analyze the distribution of colors at the vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F) under the assumption that there is no equilateral triangle with monochromatic vertices: - Each pair of vertices such as (A-C, B-D, C-E,) etc., must have different colors. Otherwise, they would form an equilateral triangle with the same colors upon connecting the vertex pairs along with the center. - Thus, in order to avoid a monochromatic equilateral triangle, each vertex of our hexagon must alternately be colored black and white.

Following the same logic, if we place another hexagon on a black vertex of the original hexagon, we run into an unavoidable scenario: placing this new hexagon on one of the previous hexagon vertices requires that at least one triangle becomes equilateral and monochromatic. 7. Specifically, vertices (B, D, F) now must form monochromatic triangles together with their new centers if avoiding same-color triangles is impossible.

Second Volley: ( B, D, E ) - If the rabbit moved to ( B, D, ) or ( E ), it gets hit. - If the rabbit was at a white vertex ( G ), or the vertices ( A ), and moved to vertices ( B, D, ) or ( E ). Third Volley: ( D, E, G ) - If the rabbit moved to ( D, E, ) or ( G ), it gets hit. - If the rabbit was at a black vertex ( F ), or the vertices ( A ), and moved to vertices ( D, E, ) or ( G ), this sequence alleviates that. Fourth Volley: ( A, C, F ) - If the rabbit was not previously hit and moved to any black vertices, now it gets hit. - This volley serves as an assurance if, by any chance, the rabbit hops within this loop back to a black vertex. Given this cyclical pattern of volleys alternating between different sets of black and white vertices, the design is such that the rabbit cannot indefinitely avoid getting hit within these four volleys due to the impossibility of avoiding both types of coloured vertices through valid moves across edges. # Conclusion: Thus, the four volleys defined above will catch the rabbit: [ boxed{(C, F, H), (B, D, E), (D, E, G), (A, C, F)} ]"},{"prompt":"Numbers 1, 2, 3, ldots, 1000000000 are listed. Then each number is replaced by the sum of its digits, and this process is repeated until only singledigit numbers remain in the sequence.

Given the problem, we need to determine whether there are more occurrences of the digit 1 or the digit 5 after repeatedly replacing each number in the list from 1 to 1,000,000,000 with the sum of its digits until only single digit numbers remain. 2. Recall that any number can be repeatedly summed by its digits until it becomes a single-digit number, which is equivalent to taking the number modulo 9. This principle is derived from the divisibility rule for 9. 3. The single-digit result of repeatedly summing the digits of a number ( n ) will be congruent to ( n mod 9 ). 4. Hence, the numbers in the last row will be the digits (1, 2, ..., 9) repeating in sequences determined by their equivalence classes modulo 9. 5. Let's examine the distribution: - The number ( 1 mod 9 rightarrow 1 ) - The number ( 2 mod 9 rightarrow 2 ) - The number ( 3 mod 9 rightarrow 3 ) - The number ( 4 mod 9 rightarrow 4 ) - The number ( 5 mod 9 rightarrow 5 ) - The number ( 6 mod 9 rightarrow 6 ) - The number ( 7 mod 9 rightarrow 7 ) - The number ( 8 mod 9 rightarrow 8 ) - The number ( 0 mod 9 rightarrow 9 ) 6. Note that we have all digits from 1 to 9 repeating but since the sequence starts from 1 to 999,999,999, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly (1,000,000,000 - 1) / 9 times each. 7. Calculating how many times each digit appears: - Let's denote ( n ) as the total digits: ( n = 999,999,999 ) - Each digit appears ( lfloor frac{n}{9} rfloor ) times. 8. This gives ( lfloor frac{999,999,999}{9} rfloor = 111,111,111 ) occurrences for each of the digits 1 through 9. 9. Additionally, since we are summing up to 1,000,000,000, there is one extra position beyond the full cycles (nine full cycles). This position is ( 1,000,000,000 ), whose digit sum eventually leads to 1. 10. Therefore, the digit 1 appears one more time than any other digit in the final row. # Conclusion: Hence, in the final sequence, there is exactly one more occurrence of the digit 1 than the digit 5, thus: [ boxed{text{Digit 1 appears more frequently than digit 5}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) has an eccentricity of 2, and one of its foci coincides with the focus of the parabola y^2 = 16x, then the equation of the asymptote of the hyperbola is __________.","completion":"Since the focus of the parabola y^2 = 16x is F(4,0), thus the right focus of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) is also F(4,0), we can obtain a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = 16, and since the eccentricity of the hyperbola is 2, thus frac{c}{a} = 2, we get a = frac{1}{2}c = 2, hence b = sqrt{c^2 - a^2} = 2sqrt{3}, therefore, the equation of the asymptote of the hyperbola is y = pm frac{b}{a}x, which is y = pm sqrt{3}x.

Let's denote the roots of f(x) = 0 as r_1 and r_2. Firstly, we find r_1 and r_2 by solving: [ x^2 + 4x + c = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 - 4c}}{2} = -2 pm sqrt{4 - c} ] Let r_1 = -2 + sqrt{4 - c} and r_2 = -2 - sqrt{4 - c}. To have distinct roots for f(f(x)) = 0, one of the f(x) = r_i must have exactly one double root and the other equation must have two distinct roots.

We argue that the distance between any two points on the polyhedron's surface cannot exceed 21. **Step 3:** Suppose the contrary, i.e., there exist two points A and B on the surface of the polyhedron such that the distance between them, AB, exceeds 21. Recognize that each face of the polyhedron lies outside a sphere with a radius slightly larger than the given sphere. **Step 4:** Let's consider another sphere with radius R = 11 that would encompass all vertices of the polyhedron, marking the center of this sphere as O. **Step 5:** If there were a point A on the surface of the polyhedron such that the distance from the center O to A, OA, is greater than 11: - Any point A on the polyhedron's surface satisfies OA leq 11. - Consider an intersection of the line segment OA with part of the polyhedron's surface at point B, such that O lies between A and B along the line segment: [ OB = 10 quad (text{since the point } B text{ is tangent to the sphere with radius 10 at center } O). ] [ AB = AO + OB > 11 + 10 = 21. ] Hence, our assumption that there can be a point that is greater than 21 units apart must be false. Consequently, no such point that is greater than 11 units away from the center of the polyhedron's surface exists. **Step 6:** Consider each face of the polyhedron intersecting the sphere at 11 units, termed as a \\"cap\\" with surface area. Using the formula for the surface area of spherical caps: [ text{Area of cap} = 2 pi R (R-r), ] where R = 11 and r = 10. Thus, the area of each cap is: [ 2 pi times 11 times (11 - 10) = 22 pi. ] **Step 7:** Given the entire surface area of the sphere (with radius 11 units) is: [ text{Total surface area} = 4 pi R^2 = 4 pi times 11^2 = 484 pi. ] **Step 8:** For the caps to cover the entire sphere, the number of caps must satisfy: [ n times 22 pi geq 484 pi. ] Solving for n: [ n geq frac{484 pi}{22 pi} = frac{484}{22} = 22. ] Thus, n geq 22. Since the initial condition assumed a 20-faced polyhedron, it must be wrong, because we need at least 22 faces to ensure coverage of the sphere.

Let ( a_i, b_i in C ), ( i = overline{0, p-1} ) such that ( a_i neq b_i ) and ( a_i equiv b_i equiv i pmod{p} ).

Let ( a - b = d ) be the greatest difference of two numbers from ( C ). Let ( 2 = p_1 < p_2 < ldots < p_t le d < p_{t+1} < ldots ) be the sequence of prime numbers. According to our assumption, for each ( i = overline{1, t} ), there exists a remainder ( r_i ) upon ( p_i ) which is met at most one time among the numbers in ( C ).

The sum ( S ) of these numbers is congruent to ( 2(0 + 1 + ldots + (p-1)) = (p-1)p equiv 0 pmod{p} ). It is clear that ( p < 2003 ).

Thus, the general formula for the sequence is a_{n} = a_{2}q^{n-2} = 4 cdot 2^{n-2} = 2^n, (n in mathbb{N}^*). (Ⅱ) Since a_{n} = 2^n, we can write b_{n} = 2log_{2}a_{n} - 1 = 2n - 1. Therefore, we have a_{n}b_{n} = (2n - 1)2^n.

Subtracting these two expressions, we get -T_{n} = 2 + 2 cdot 2^2 + 2 cdot 2^3 + ldots + 2 cdot 2^{n} - (2n - 1)2^{n+1} = 2 + 2 cdot frac{4(1 - 2^{n-1})}{1 - 2} - (2n - 1)2^{n+1} = -6 - (2n - 3)2^{n+1}. Therefore, we find that T_{n} = 6 + (2n - 3)2^{n+1}. boxed{T_{n} = 6 + (2n - 3)2^{n+1}} is our final expression for the sum of the first n terms."},{"prompt":"Find the indefinite integral: int frac{x^{3}+9 x^{2}+21 x+21}{(x+3)^{2}left(x^{2}+3right)} d x","completion":"1. **Rewrite the integral:** We need to find the indefinite integral [ int frac{x^{3} + 9x^{2} + 21x + 21}{(x+3)^{2}(x^{2}+3)} , dx ] 2. **Decompose into partial fractions:** To simplify the integrand, we decompose it into partial fractions: [ frac{x^{3} + 9x^{2} + 21x + 21}{(x+3)^{2}(x^{2}+3)} = frac{A_{1}}{x+3} + frac{A_{2}}{(x+3)^{2}} + frac{Bx+C}{x^{2}+3} ] 3. **Combine and match coefficients:** Rewrite the equation by combining the partial fractions and matching terms: [ frac{A_{1}(x+3)(x^{2}+3) + A_{2}(x^{2}+3) + (Bx+C)(x+3)^{2}}{(x+3)^{2}(x^{2}+3)} ] Simplify the numerator: [ = frac{A_{1}(x^{3} + 3x^{2} + 3x + 9) + A_{2}(x^{2} + 3) + B(x^{3} + 6x^{2} + 9x) + C(x^{2} + 6x + 9)}{(x+3)^{2}(x^{2}+3)} ] Combine like terms: [ = frac{(A_{1} + B)x^{3} + (3A_{1} + A_{2} + 6B + C)x^{2} + (3A_{1} + 9B + 6C)x + (9A_{1} + 3A_{2} + 9C)}{(x+3)^{2}(x^{2}+3)} ] Set this equal to the original numerator (x^{3} + 9x^{2} + 21x + 21) and solve for (A_{1}, A_{2}, B, C): [ { begin{array}{l} A_{1} + B = 1 3A_{1} + A_{2} + 6B + C = 9 3A_{1} + 9B + 6C = 21 9A_{1} + 3A_{2} + 9C = 21 end{array} } 4. **Solve for coefficients:** Substitute (B = 1 - A_{1}) into the equations: [ { begin{array}{l} B = 1 - A_{1} 3A_{1} + A_{2} + 6 - 6A_{1} + C = 9 implies -3A_{1} + A_{2} + C = 3 3A_{1} + 9 - 9A_{1} + 6C = 21 implies -6A_{1} + 6C = 12 implies C = 2 + A_{1} 9A_{1} + 3A_{2} + 9(2 + A_{1}) = 21 implies 9A_{1} + 3A_{2} + 18 + 9A_{1} = 21 implies 18A_{1} + 3A_{2} = 3 } ] Substitute (C = 2 + A_{1}): [ { begin{array}{l} B = 1 - A_{1} -2A_{1} + A_{2} = 1 18A_{1} + 3A_{2} = 3 } ] Solve for (A_{2}) from both equations: [ { begin{array}{l} A_{2} = 1 + 2A_{1} 18A_{1} + 3(1 + 2A_{1}) = 3 implies 18A_{1} + 3 + 6A_{1} = 3 implies 24A_{1} + 3 = 3 implies 24A_{1} = 0 implies A_{1} = 0 } ] Then, [ { begin{array}{l} A_{1} = 0 B = 1 - 0 = 1 A_{2} = 1 + 2(0) = 1 C = 2 + 0 = 2 } ] 5. **Rewrite the integral with determined coefficients:** Substitute these values back into the decomposition: [ frac{x^{3} + 9x^{2} + 21x + 21}{(x+3)^{2}(x^{2}+3)} = frac{1}{(x+3)^{2}} + frac{x+2}{x^{2}+3} ] 6. **Integrate each term separately:** [ int frac{1}{(x+3)^{2}} , dx + int frac{x+2}{x^{2}+3} , dx ] For the first term, perform standard integration: [ int frac{1}{(x+3)^{2}} , dx = -frac{1}{x+3} ] For the second term: [ int frac{x+2}{x^{2}+3} , dx = int frac{x}{x^{2}+3} , dx + int frac{2}{x^{2}+3} , dx ] Use substitution (u = x^{2} + 3), then (du = 2x , dx): [ frac{1}{2} int frac{2x}{x^{2}+3} , dx = frac{1}{2} int frac{du}{u} = frac{1}{2} ln |x^{2} + 3| = frac{1}{2} ln (x^{2} + 3) ] For the remaining term: [ int frac{2}{x^{2}+3} , dx = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} operatorname{arctg} left( frac{x}{sqrt{3}} right) ] 7. **Combine results:** Therefore, combining these results gives: [ int frac{x^{3} + 9x^{2} + 21x + 21}{(x+3)^{2}(x^{2}+3)} , dx = -frac{1}{x+3} + frac{1}{2} ln (x^{2} + 3) + frac{2}{sqrt{3}} operatorname{arctg} left( frac{x}{sqrt{3}} right) + C ] Conclusion: [ boxed{-frac{1}{x+3} + frac{1}{2} ln (x^{2} + 3) + frac{2}{sqrt{3}} operatorname{arctg} left( frac{x}{sqrt{3}} right) + C} ]"},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=({1,2}),overrightarrow{b}=({λ,1}), and overrightarrow{a}∥overrightarrow{b}, find the value of lambda.

Step 7: Odd count of +1 for specific configurations Every step changes the signs at an even number of positions for diagonals. If at any point, an odd number of +1s exist at any specific configurations, the possible results will be constrained by odd parity.

This ensures that the sequence begins with distinct positive integers. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that we have chosen ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n-1} ) for some ( n geq 2 ). We need to choose ( a_{2n} ) and ( a_{2n+1} ) such that: - Every positive integer appears exactly once in the sequence. - The number ( tau(na_{n+1}^n + (n+1)a_n^{n+1}) ) is divisible by ( n ) for all ( n ). 3. **Choosing ( a_{2n+1} )**: Select ( a_{2n+1} ) to be the smallest natural number that has not appeared yet in the sequence. This ensures that every positive integer appears exactly once. 4. **Choosing ( a_{2n} )**: We need to choose ( a_{2n} ) such that it satisfies the following divisibility conditions: [ 2n mid tauleft( 2na_{2n+1}^{2n} + (2n+1)a_{2n}^{2n+1} right) ] [ (2n-1) mid tauleft( (2n-1)a_{2n}^{2n-1} + 2n a_{2n-1}^{2n} right) ] 5. **Existence of ( a_{2n} )**: To ensure the existence of such an ( a_{2n} ), we use Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions. Specifically, we choose two distinct odd primes ( p_n ) and ( q_n ) such that: - ( p_n > max(2n+1, a_{2n-1}, a_{2n+1}) ) and ( p_n equiv 2 pmod{2n+1} ) - ( q_n > max(2n+1, a_{2n-1}, a_{2n+1}) ) and ( q_n equiv 2 pmod{2n-1} ) 6. **Solving Congruences**: Since the reduced residue system modulo an odd prime power ( p^e ) is cyclic of order ( p^{e-1}(p-1) ), and ( p_n(p_n - 1) ) is coprime to ( 2n+1 ), we find that when ( x ) goes through a reduced residue system modulo ( p_n^{2n} ), so does ( (2n+1)x^{2n+1} ). Thus, the congruence equation: [ (2n+1)x^{2n+1} equiv p_n^{2n-1} - 2na_{2n+1}^{2n} pmod{p_n^{2n}} ] has solutions. Similarly, the congruence equation: [ (2n-1)x^{2n-1} equiv q_n^{2n-2} - 2na_{2n-1}^{2n} pmod{q_n^{2n-1}} ] also has solutions. 7. **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can find an ( x ) that satisfies both congruences. We take ( a_{2n} = x ) to be large enough to ensure it is distinct from ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n-1}, a_{2n+1} ). 8. **Verification**: The first congruence ensures that: [ v_{p_n}left( 2na_{2n+1}^{2n} + (2n+1)a_{2n}^{2n+1} right) = 2n-1 ] Thus, [ 2n = tau(p_{n}^{2n-1}) mid tauleft( 2na_{2n+1}^{2n} + (2n+1)a_{2n}^{2n+1} right) ] Similarly, the second congruence ensures that: [ v_{q_n}left( (2n-1)a_{2n}^{2n-1} + 2n a_{2n-1}^{2n} right) = 2n-2 ] Thus, [ 2n-1 = tau(q_{n}^{2n-2}) mid tauleft( (2n-1)a_{2n}^{2n-1} + 2n a_{2n-1}^{2n} right) ] 9. **Conclusion**: By induction, we have constructed a sequence ( {a_n} ) that meets all the requirements.

This implies that the quadrilateral ( ABA'D ) is harmonic. - Therefore, the pencil ( C(A, A', B, D) = -1 ) is harmonic. This means that the cross-ratio ((A, A'; B, D)) is (-1). 3. **Intersection and Harmonic Conjugates:** - Since ( E equiv AC cap BD ), and given the harmonic property, we have ((E, P, B, D) = -1). This means that ( E ) and ( P ) are harmonic conjugates with respect to ( B ) and ( D ). 4. **Angle Bisectors:** - The line ( QE ) bisects the angle (angle BQB' equiv angle BQD).

In order for both sides to be integers, neither (k) nor (m) can make both sides equal without common factors. - Since 9 and 8 are co-prime (they have no common factors except 1), none of the positions ( frac{k}{9} ) will coincide with positions ( frac{m}{8} ). 5. **Count the unique marked points:** - Rohan's 8 cuts and Jai's 7 cuts imply there are a total of ( 8 + 7 = 15 ) different marked points (as no marked points coincide). 6. **Calculate the number of resulting pieces:** - Each cut divides the string into additional pieces. - The original string is uncut (1 piece), and 15 new cuts create ( 15 + 1 = 16 ) pieces. # Conclusion: Yuvraj will obtain 16 pieces of string after making all the cuts.

Therefore, we can write ( x_i = frac{a + ib}{M} ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ), where ( a, b, M in mathbb{N}^* ) (the set of strictly positive natural numbers). 2. **Simplifying with ( b = 1 ):** To simplify, we initially consider ( b = 1 ). Thus, ( x_i = frac{a + i}{M} ). 3. **Avoiding Numerator-Denominator Overlap:** To ensure that no numerator ( a_i ) overlaps with any denominator ( b_i ), we can add a sufficiently large integer to shift our numerators above our denominators. Specifically, we can choose constants such that ( frac{a}{M} > M ). 4. **Specifying the Arithmetic Sequence:** Define ( M ) to be the product of distinct prime numbers ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ), where ( p_1 > p_2 > cdots > p_k ) are sufficiently large primes (e.g., ( forall i, p_i geq k )). Let ( a ) satisfy the following system of congruences: [ begin{cases} a + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p_1} a + 2 equiv 0 pmod{p_2} quad vdots a + k equiv 0 pmod{p_k} end{cases} ] By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, such an integer ( a ) exists. 5. **Verifying the Choice:** Verify that for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ), ( x_i = frac{frac{a + i}{p_i}}{frac{M}{p_i}} ) is in reduced form. The prime ( p_i ) cancels out, making sure the numerators and denominators are distinct: - The numerators ( frac{a + i}{p_i} ) are distinct because ( a + i ) are distinct modulo their corresponding primes ( p_i ). - The denominators ( frac{M}{p_i} ) are distinct since ( M ) is the product of distinct primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ). Hence, ( gcd left( frac{a + i}{p_i}, frac{M}{p_i} right) = 1 ), ensuring ( x_i ) are in reduced form. 6. **Avoiding Numerator-Denominator Equality:** Ensuring that the smallest numerator is larger than the largest possible denominator, we can select ( a ) such that ( a geq M^2 + 1 ). This ensures ( frac{a + 1}{M} ) (smallest numerator divided by ( M )) is larger than ( M ) (largest possible denominator). # Conclusion: Using the steps and verifications above, we have constructed a sequence fitting all the properties required. Therefore, we conclude that the Arithmetic Sequence exists for every ( k geq 1 ): [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Two flag poles of height h and k are situated 2a units apart on a level surface.

In this case, we have: - a^2 = 2, so a = sqrt{2} - b^2 = 1, so b = 1 The distance c from the center to a focus of the hyperbola is found using the relationship c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Therefore, [c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = sqrt{2 + 1} = sqrt{3}] **Step 2: Calculating |F_1F_2|** The distance between the foci |F_1F_2| is given by 2c.

Substituting a = sqrt{2} and b = 1, we get: [y = ±frac{1}{sqrt{2}}x = ±frac{sqrt{2}}{2}x] Thus, option D is incorrect because it states the slope of the asymptotic lines as frac{1}{2} instead of frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. **Conclusion:** The correct options are A and B, encapsulated as boxed{AB}."},{"prompt":"abel had 216 pieces of candy.

Since each pig needs 3 gallons of water and there are 8 pigs, the total amount of water needed for the pigs is: 8 pigs * 3 gallons/pig = 24 gallons for the pigs Next, let's calculate the amount of water needed for the horses. Since each horse needs twice as much water as a pig, and each pig needs 3 gallons, each horse needs: 2 * 3 gallons = 6 gallons per horse There are 10 horses, so the total amount of water needed for the horses is: 10 horses * 6 gallons/horse = 60 gallons for the horses Now, let's add the water needed for the pigs and the horses together: 24 gallons (pigs) + 60 gallons (horses) = 84 gallons for pigs and horses Carla needs to bring 114 gallons of water in total. To find out how much water is needed for the chickens, we subtract the total water needed for the pigs and horses from the total water Carla needs to bring: 114 gallons (total) - 84 gallons (pigs and horses) = 30 gallons for the chickens Therefore, the tank for the chickens needs boxed{30} gallons of water."},{"prompt":"The price of a certain painting increased by 30% during the first year and decreased by some percentage during the second year.

(The angles of a circular polygon are the angles between the tangents to the circles at the vertices of the triangle; see above note for Problem 73.) Note: Denoting the angles of the circular triangle (ABC) by (A, B, C), the lengths of the sides by (a, b, c), and the radii of the arcs forming the sides by ( r_a, r_b, r_c ), the theorem of Problem 100 can be written as [ A + B + C mp frac{a}{r_a} mp frac{b}{r_b} mp frac{c}{r_c} = pi ] where the signs () and (+) are chosen depending on the direction of convexity of the corresponding side.

Let the side lengths opposite these angles be (a), (b), and (c). The radii of the arcs forming the sides are (r_a), (r_b), and (r_c).

According to the generalized sine rule (refer to the Extended Law of Sines for triangles inscribed in a circle), if chords AA’ and BB’ are equal, then the corresponding arcs they subtend must either be equal or add up to 360^circ. 4. Consider the arcs (AB), (BA'), and (AB'). Let us denote the measures of these arcs (not containing point C) as follows: - Arc AB = 2gamma (since angle C = gamma). - Arc (BA' = alpha) (this arc is opposite to the chord AA', equivalent to the angle at alpha). - Arc AB' = beta (this arc is opposite to the chord BB', equivalent to the angle beta). 5. Given that AA’ = BB’, the arcs they subtend should either be equal or their complementary arcs sum to {360^circ}. We investigate these two scenarios: 1. **Case 1: The arcs are equal** [ 2gamma + alpha = 2gamma + beta ] [ Rightarrow alpha = beta ] This implies angle A = angle B, which means that triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = BC. 2. **Case 2: The arcs sum to 360^circ** [ 2gamma + alpha = 360^circ - (2gamma + beta) ] [ Rightarrow 2gamma + alpha = 360^circ - 2gamma - beta ] Simplifying, we get: [ alpha + beta = 360^circ - 4gamma ] Since the angles in a triangle must sum to 180^circ, we have: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ ] Substituting alpha + beta from our earlier equation: [ 180^circ - gamma = 360^circ - 4gamma ] Solving for gamma: [ 3gamma = 180^circ ] [ Rightarrow gamma = 60^circ ] Thus, we get angle C = 60^circ. # Conclusion: Based on our analysis, we conclude that either triangle ABC is isosceles with alpha = beta, or angle C = 60^circ.

The distinct sums can be the integers 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 3. **Sum Calculation:** The sum of the distinct numbers 3 through 8 is: [ 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 33 ] This total sum represents the sum of all row sums plus the sum of all column sums. 4. **Double Counting Adjustment:** Since the total (33) includes both row and column sums and each number in the table is counted twice (once in its row and once in its column), we need to divide by 2 to find the aggregate sum of the numbers in the table: [ text{Sum of numbers in the table} = frac{33}{2} = 16.5 ] Since the sum must be an integer, it should be as close to this value as possible but must be minimized in natural number terms. 5. **Test the Next Integer:** To meet the constraints with natural numbers, the correct integer should be slightly higher than 16.5. Therefore the minimum possible integer value must be 17. 6. **Validation by Example:** We will construct a (3 times 3) table where the sum of the elements is 17.

The case for ( beta ) is similar. - If ( alpha beta = M^n ), the number of ( t ) is exactly the number of ( frac{M^n}{t} )'s.

To elaborate, consider three points (A, B, C) such that (B) lies on the segment (AC). The broken line (ACB) would intersect itself if another point tries to connect sequentially. 2. **Understanding Convex Hull**: - The convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose all the points. - When we consider any four points, their convex hull must either be a triangle or a quadrilateral. Here, let's focus on the case where the convex hull is a triangle, which implies one of the points lies inside the triangle. 3. **Considering Four Points**: - Let's argue that four points can be arranged such that the broken line does not intersect itself. - The four points (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4) could form a quadrilateral or a triangle with one point inside. - Example: (A_1, A_2, A_3) forming a triangle and (A_4) either inside or appropriately positioned such that no broken line formed intersects itself. 4. **Contradiction with Five Points**: - Now, let’s consider we have five points (A, B, C, D, E). - For the broken line not to intersect itself, there can't be any point inside the convex hull of other points. Suppose that (A, B, C) form a triangle and (D) is placed inside this triangle. Now, placing the fifth point (E) will create an intersection unavoidably.

From the given prime numbers, the twin prime pairs that can be formed are (3, 5) and (5, 7). This gives us a total of 2 cases where twin prime pairs are formed. To find the probability of forming a twin prime pair, we need to calculate the total number of ways two numbers can be chosen from the set of 4 numbers.

Noticing that fleft(-xright)=fleft(xright), we can conclude that f(x) is an even function. This is because both |x| and {x}^{2} are even functions themselves, and the composition and combination of even functions remain even. **Step 2: Determine the behavior of f(x) for xgeqslant 0** For xgeqslant 0, the function simplifies to f(x)={3}^{1+x}-frac{1}{1+{x}^{2}}. Since {3}^{1+x} is a monotonically increasing exponential function and -frac{1}{1+{x}^{2}} decreases as x increases, their sum, f(x), is also monotonically increasing for xgeqslant 0. **Step 3: Solve the inequality fleft(xright) < fleft(2x+1right)** Given that f(x) is even and monotonically increasing for xgeqslant 0, we can rewrite the inequality as fleft(|x|right) < fleft(|2x+1|right). This implies that |x| < |2x+1|. Solving this inequality involves considering the absolute values: 1. For x < -1, |x| > |2x+1|, which does not satisfy the inequality. 2.

For the quadratic function y=x^2-2x-1, we have a=1 and b=-2. Plugging these values into the formula gives us the axis of symmetry as x=-frac{-2}{2cdot1} = 1.

A square is a special case of a rhombus where all angles are right angles, but the condition does not exclude rhombuses with non-right angles. Therefore, the statement in option B is false. **Option C**: A hyperbola, being symmetric with respect to its center, implies that if it passes through a point (x,y), it does not necessarily pass through the point (y,x) unless specific conditions about its axes are met.

The goal is to see if he could have allocated his funds more profitably in early 2015. 1. Let's consider the amount of money Vladimir would have if he invested in annual deposits: - Initially, Vladimir bought buckwheat at 70 RUB/kg. - He could put this 70 RUB into an annual deposit at an interest rate of 16% for the first year and then reinvest it at 10% for the second year, since the interest rates changed in 2016.

Compare the obtained amounts with the cost of buckwheat in early 2017, which is 85 RUB per kg. - From annual deposits: 89.32 RUB - From a two-year deposit: 92.575 RUB Since both amounts are higher than 85 RUB, it indicates that Vladimir could indeed have possibly distributed his funds more profitably than by keeping the buckwheat. Therefore, the conclusion follows that Vladimir had an opportunity to allocate his resources better at the beginning of 2015. **Conclusion for Part (a):** (boxed{text{Yes, Vladimir had the opportunity to allocate his resources more profitably in early 2015.}}) **Part (b)** To optimally assess Vladimir's decision, we must consider various factors: 1. **Non-Monetary Factors**: - **Shelf-life of Buckwheat**: Stored buckwheat could spoil or deteriorate in quality over time, reducing its value. - **Storage Space**: Storing large quantities of buckwheat requires space, potentially causing inconvenience in his home. - **Mental Comfort**: Having a stock of buckwheat might provide psychological comfort, reducing anxiety about food scarcity. 2. **Monetary Factors**: - **Opportunity Cost**: The potential returns from alternative investments should be considered. - **Inflation Rate**: The purchasing power of money decreases over time due to inflation, which affects future prices and investment returns. - **Market Fluctuations**: The price of buckwheat and interest rates can fluctuate unpredictably. Vladimir couldn't foresee these changes with certainty in 2015. Considering these factors ensures a more comprehensive evaluation. **Conclusion for Part (b):** (boxed{text{Various monetary and non-monetary factors must be considered to evaluate the optimality of Vladimir’s decision.}}) **Part (c)** The conclusion that Vladimir could have more profitably allocated his resources does not imply that his decision at the time was suboptimal. This is explained by: 1. **Ex-Post Evaluations**: We are analyzing with the benefit of hindsight. Vladimir’s decision was based on the information available in 2015, and future prices and interest rates were not predictable with certainty. 2. **Rational Decision Making**: Given the interest rates and his understanding of the market at that time, his actions may have been rational and optimal based on expectations and available data. This highlights the difference between optimal decisions at the time they are made versus evaluations made after the outcomes are known. **Conclusion for Part (c):** (boxed{text{Because optimal decisions are based on available information at the time, even if they seem suboptimal with hindsight.}})"},{"prompt":"Matilda bought a smartphone for some amount.

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x: [x > -frac{1}{2}] Since the solutions to the inequality frac{4x+a}{3} > 1 are also solutions to the inequality -frac{2x+1}{2} < 0, we compare the two expressions for x: [frac{3-a}{4} geq -frac{1}{2}] To solve this inequality for a, we proceed as follows: 1.

Given that f(x) = x for x in [0,1], it follows that f(x) = |x| for x in [-1,1].

For the function g(x) = f(x) - kx - k to have four zeros in the interval [-1,3], the parameter k must be chosen such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects the line y = kx + k at four distinct points within the interval [-1,3]. Considering the shape and properties of f(x) within the given interval, and the requirement for four intersections, it's clear that the slope of the line y = kx + k (which is k) must be positive and cannot be too large; otherwise, it would not intersect the graph of f(x) four times. Specifically, k must be greater than 0 but less than the slope of the tangent to f(x) at the points where f(x) changes its form. Without loss of generality and detailed calculations, we can conclude that k must be in the range (0, infty) to satisfy the condition of four intersections based on the given conditions and the behavior of f(x). However, to determine the exact upper limit of k, we would need to analyze the intersections in more detail, which is not provided in the solution.

This involves \\"cutting out\\" overlapping parts successively: - From the second magazine, cut out the part that is covered by the first magazine, if such a part exists. - From the third magazine, cut out the parts that are already covered by the first and second magazines. - Continue this procedure by cutting out the parts of each subsequent magazine that are covered by any of the previous ones. By the end, the tenth magazine only retains the part that is not covered by the first nine magazines. 3. After this process, we will have 10 magazines, some of which might have parts removed. In the end, they cover the table in a single layer without any overlaps. 4. Given that initially the magazines fully cover the table, and now we have them in a single (non-overlapping) layer, we can assert that the combined area of these 10 magazines is exactly the area of the table. 5. Select the 5 largest magazines. Since together they must cover at least half the area of the table (as removing the remaining magazines should still leave these five maintaining at least half the coverage), these 5 magazines fulfill the requirement of covering at least half of the table's area.

Line a is parallel to line b. 2. Line b is perpendicular to plane alpha. From these, we can infer that line a is also perpendicular to plane alpha since parallel lines maintain their perpendicularity to planes. The statement in question is whether alpha being perpendicular to beta is related to a being parallel to beta. - If alpha is perpendicular to beta, and considering a is perpendicular to alpha, it does not directly imply that a is parallel to beta. However, it sets a geometric condition that could influence the orientation of a with respect to beta. This condition is necessary because, for a to be parallel to beta, alpha and beta must be oriented in a specific way (i.e., perpendicular to each other), given the initial conditions. - However, this condition alone is not sufficient. There could be other factors or orientations of a, alpha, and beta that also need to be considered. For example, a could be a subset of beta or have some other spatial relationship not directly inferred from alpha being perpendicular to beta. Therefore, the conclusion is that alpha being perpendicular to beta is a necessary condition for a to be parallel to beta because it sets a foundational geometric relationship.

First, find the coordinates of the two points, then use the slope formula for two points to find the slope of the secant line. Next, use the fact that the derivative at a tangent point equals the slope of the tangent line to find the coordinates of the tangent point. After that, use the point-slope form of the line equation to find the equation of the tangent line. Finally, use the condition for a line to be tangent to a circle to find a, and thus the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola. 1. Find the coordinates of the two points: The x-coordinates of the two points are given as x_1=-4 and x_2=2. Substitute these values into the equation of the parabola to find the corresponding y-coordinates. For x_1=-4: y_1=(-4)^{2}+a(-4)-5=16-4a-5=11-4a. For x_2=2: y_2=(2)^{2}+a(2)-5=4+2a-5=2a-1. So, the two points are (-4,11-4a) and (2,2a-1). 2. Find the slope of the secant line: Use the slope formula for two points: k=frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=frac{(2a-1)-(11-4a)}{2-(-4)}=a-2. 3. Find the coordinates of the tangent point: The slope of the tangent line to the parabola at any point is given by the derivative of the parabola's equation. For y=x^{2}+ax-5, the derivative is y'=2x+a. Equate this to the slope of the secant line (which is parallel to the tangent line) to find the x-coordinate of the tangent point: 2x+a=a-2 Rightarrow x=-1. Substitute this value into the equation of the parabola to find the y-coordinate of the tangent point: y=(-1)^{2}+a(-1)-5=-a-4. So, the tangent point is (-1,-a-4). 4. Find the equation of the tangent line: Use the point-slope form of the line equation: y-y_1=k(x-x_1) Rightarrow y-(-a-4)=(a-2)(x-(-1)) Rightarrow (a-2)x-y-6=0. 5. Find the value of a: The distance from the center of the circle (which is at the origin (0,0)) to the tangent line equals the radius of the circle. The radius can be found from the equation of the circle: 5x^{2}+5y^{2}=36 Rightarrow x^{2}+y^{2}=frac{36}{5} Rightarrow r=sqrt{frac{36}{5}}. The distance from the point (x_0,y_0) to the line Ax+By+C=0 is given by the formula d=frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}}. In this case, (x_0,y_0)=(0,0), A=a-2, B=-1, and C=-6, so d=frac{|(a-2)(0)-1(0)-6|}{sqrt{(a-2)^{2}+1}}=frac{6}{sqrt{(a-2)^{2}+1}}. Equate this to the radius to find a: frac{6}{sqrt{(a-2)^{2}+1}}=sqrt{frac{36}{5}} Rightarrow a=4 or a=0 (discard a=0 because aneq 0). 6. Find the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola: The equation of the parabola is y=x^{2}+ax-5. With a=4, this becomes y=x^{2}+4x-5. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by x=frac{-b}{2a}=frac{-4}{2cdot 1}=-2. Substitute this into the equation of the parabola to find the y-coordinate of the vertex: y=(-2)^{2}+4(-2)-5=-9.

Using this, we calculate ((a+b+c)^3): [ (a + b + c)^3 = 0^3 = 0 ] Expanding ((a + b - (-c))^3), we get: [ (a + b - c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + (-c)^3 + 3ab(-c) + 3a(-c)b + 3b^2(-c) ] Simplifying it further, we use the identity for the expansion of cubes: [ a^3 + b^3 - c^3 + 3ab(-c) = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc ] Since (c = -a - b): [ a^3 + b^3 + (-a - b)^3 - 3ab(-a - b) = 0 ] From this: [ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = 0 quad Rightarrow quad a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc ] 3. **Repeating the Process for the Second Triplet:** Similarly, for the second triplet ((d, e, f)), we have: [ d + e + f = 0 quad Rightarrow quad f = -d - e ] Thus: [ d^3 + e^3 + (-d - e)^3 - 3de(-d - e) = 0 ] Simplifying: [ d^3 + e^3 + f^3 - 3def = 0 quad Rightarrow quad d^3 + e^3 + f^3 = 3def ] 4. **Forming and Relating the Ratios:** Now, we form the ratios of the sums of the cubes of the members of the triplets: [ frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{d^3 + e^3 + f^3} = frac{3abc}{3def} = frac{abc}{def} ] Therefore, the sums of the cubes of the members of these triplets relate to each other in the same way as the products of their members. # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3}{d^3 + e^3 + f^3} = frac{abc}{def}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the hyperbola C: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > 0,b > 0) with an eccentricity of frac{sqrt{5}}{2}, find the equations of its asymptotes.","completion":"1.

For a hyperbola of the given form, the asymptotes are lines that pass through the origin and have slopes pm dfrac{b}{a}. - Since the angle given is 60^{circ}, the complementary angle, which is the angle the asymptote actually makes with the x-axis, is 30^{circ}. Hence, we use the tangent of this angle to find the relationship between b and a. 2. **Finding the Relationship Between b and a**: - We have tan 30^{circ} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}. This is equal to the slope of the asymptote, which is dfrac{b}{a}. - Therefore, dfrac{b}{a} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}. 3. **Calculating the Eccentricity (e)**: - The eccentricity of a hyperbola is given by e = dfrac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center to a focus. For a hyperbola, c^2 = a^2 + b^2. - Substituting dfrac{b}{a} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3} into the eccentricity formula, we get: [ e = sqrt{1 + left(dfrac{b}{a}right)^2} = sqrt{1 + left(dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{1 + dfrac{1}{3}} = sqrt{dfrac{4}{3}} = dfrac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. ] Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is boxed{dfrac{2sqrt{3}}{3}}, which corresponds to option boxed{D}."},{"prompt":"Given the set A={x||x1| < 2, xinmathbb{R}}, determine the intersection Acapmathbb{Z}.","completion":"1.

This new function allows us to analyze the properties of f(x) by utilizing the given condition involving the derivative. Firstly, we compute the derivative of F(x): F'(x) = dfrac{f'(x)x - f(x)}{x^2}. Given that f(x) > x f'(x), we can infer that f'(x)x - f(x) < 0. Consequently, this inequality shows that the derivative of F(x) is negative: F'(x) < 0. Since the derivative is negative, F(x) is a decreasing function on the domain (0, +infty). Moreover, given that f(2)=4, we also know that: F(2) = dfrac{f(2)}{2} = dfrac{4}{2} = 2.

Based on the given information, we formulate an equation about (a) and solve for the value of (a). **Solution** Given ({(ax+1)}^5{(x+1)}^2={(ax+1)}^5(x^2+2x+1)), the coefficient of (x^2) in the expansion equals twice the coefficient of (x) in the expansion of ({(ax+1)}^5) plus the coefficient of (x^2) in the expansion of ({(ax+1)}^5) plus the constant term of ({(ax+1)}^5), Since the general term formula of the expansion of ({(ax+1)}^5) is (T_{r+1}=a^{5-r}C_5^rcdot x^{5-r}), Setting (5-r=1), we get (r=4), hence the coefficient of (x) in the expansion of ({(ax+1)}^5) is (5a), Setting (5-r=2), we get (r=3), hence the coefficient of (x^2) in the expansion of ({(ax+1)}^5) is (10a^2), Setting (5-r=0), we get (r=5), hence the constant term of the expansion of ({(ax+1)}^5) is (1), Therefore, the coefficient of (x^2) in the expansion is (10a+10a^2+1=21), Solving this, we get (a=1) or (a=-2).

According to the problem, we have overset{→}{m}+ overset{→}{n}=(2lambda+3,3) and overset{→}{m}- overset{→}{n}=(-1,-1). Using the condition for vector perpendicularity, we find (overset{→}{m}+ overset{→}{n}) cdot (overset{→}{m}- overset{→}{n})=-2lambda-3-3=0, which gives us lambda=-3.

In the spring, the membership falls by 19%, so the number of members would be ( 100% - 19% ) of the number after the fall increase. We can express this as ( 1 - frac{19}{100} ). The total change from the original number of members to the number after the spring decrease is given as 14.95%. This means that the number of members after the spring decrease is ( 100% + 14.95% ) of the original number of members, which we can express as ( 1 + frac{14.95}{100} ).

By Vieta's formulas, the sums and products of the roots of a polynomial are related to its coefficients.

Given that ( r_1 + r_2 - r_3 - r_4 < 0 ) and ( r_1 + r_3 - r_2 - r_4 < 0 ), we can conclude that ( r_1 + r_4 - r_2 - r_3 ) must have a constant sign for all ( t ) for which ( P_t ) has four real roots. This is because the product of three terms with constant signs must itself have a constant sign. 6.

We denote this integer by ( 2k ). Therefore, we have: [ 2 + 2 sqrt{1 + 12n^2} = 2k ] 2. **Isolate the Square Root Term**: By simplifying the above equation, we get: [ 2 sqrt{1 + 12n^2} = 2k - 2 ] Dividing by 2: [ sqrt{1 + 12n^2} = k - 1 ] 3. **Square Both Sides**: We square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root: [ (sqrt{1 + 12n^2})^2 = (k - 1)^2 ] Thus: [ 1 + 12n^2 = (k - 1)^2 ] 4. **Rearrange to Isolate ( n )**: Rearrange the equation: [ 12n^2 = (k - 1)^2 - 1 ] Simplifying further, we have: [ 12n^2 = k^2 - 2k + 1 - 1 ] Therefore: [ 12n^2 = k^2 - 2k ] This can be factored as: [ 12n^2 = k(k - 2) ] 5. **Analyze Divisibility and Factorization**: Notice that ( k ) must be even (since ( k(k - 2) ) gives an even product).

The only possibility here is 2n-1 = b^2 and 2n+1 = 3c^2. The second condition is that 5n + 103 = a^2. Solving for a^2 - b^2 = 5n + 103 - (2n-1) = 3n + 104 = 80.

Therefore, we need to evaluate S(2^5 cdot 5^5 cdot N). 4. **Simplify the expression:** Notice that 2^5 cdot 5^5 = (2 cdot 5)^5 = 10^5, simplifying S(2^5 cdot 5^5 cdot N) to S(10^5 cdot N). 5. **Consider the properties of decimal multiplication:** Multiplication by 10^k for any integer k just appends k zeros to N.

Since the perimeters are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other, we realize that each of the diagonals splits the quadrilateral into congruent triangles. This property, however, is indicative of a rhombus. 6. **Proof by Diagonal Bisection**: To prove that the diagonals bisect each other, let O be the intersection of the diagonals. In triangle AOD and triangle BOC, - Since AD = BC (opposite sides of rhombus are equal), - angle AOD = angle BOC = 90^circ (Diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles), - AO = BO (the diagonals bisect each other). Hence diagonals of quadrilateral does bisect each other. 7. **Conclusion**: Based on the established properties of rhombuses and the unique characteristic of equal perimeters of the formed triangles, we conclude that the quadrilateral must be a rhombus.

Let's start the proof: 1. **Consider a right triangle:** For a right triangle with sides ( a, b ), and hypotenuse ( c ), the Pythagorean theorem tells us that: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 2. **Consider an acute triangle:** For an acute triangle ((c > a ) and ( c > b )), using the cosine rule, we have: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos gamma For an acute angle, (gamma < 90^circ), which implies ( cos gamma > 0 ), hence: c^2 < a^2 + b^2 3. **Consider the converse:** If ( c^2 < a^2 + b^2 ), we have: cos gamma = frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab} > 0 Therefore, ( gamma < 90^circ ), indicating an acute triangle. 4. **Prove the given condition implies an acute triangle:** The given condition is: a^n + b^n = c^n where ( n > 2 ). This can be rewritten as: a^{2+p} + b^{2+p} = c^{2+p} quad text{where} quad p > 0 5. **Manipulate the equation:** Multiply both sides by appropriate terms to facilitate comparison with the cosine rule inequality. Rewriting the equation, we get: a^2 cdot a^p + b^2 cdot b^p = c^2 cdot c^p 6. **Increase the left hand side:** We increase the left-hand side by replacing ( a^p ) and ( b^p ) with ( c^p ): a^2 cdot c^p + b^2 cdot c^p > c^2 cdot c^p 7. **Simplify the inequality:** Dividing through by ( c^p ) yields: a^2 + b^2 > c^2 8. **Conclusion:** Since ( a^2 + b^2 > c^2 ), using the earlier results from the cosine rule, it implies that this triangle is acute.

Consider the triangle ( ABC ) with vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). Let ( O ) be a point on side ( BC ). Reflecting triangle ( ABC ) across ( BC ) will produce a new triangle ( A'B'C' ) such that ( A' ) is the reflection of ( A ) across ( BC ), and ( B ) and ( C ) remain unchanged. 3.

Since there are three sides, and each side can be reflected to produce a symmetric triangle, the total area covered by these reflections will be three times the area of ( ABC ). 7.

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Prove (OE = OF):** - Given points (E) and (F) are intersections of the circumcircle (w) with another circle centered at (C): - Suppose (angle BCE = 2alpha). Since (BE) and (CE) are chords in the same circle, the inscribed angle (angle EFB) is (alpha) because (angle EFB = frac{1}{2} angle BCE). 2. **Use Circle Properties:** - In the circumcircle (w), angles (BCE) and (BOE) subtend the same arc (BE). Thus, (angle BOE = angle BCE = 2alpha). - (angle BOE) is an exterior angle of triangle (EOF). Therefore, (angle OEF = angle BOE - angle OFE = 2alpha - alpha = alpha). - Hence, triangle (EOF) is isosceles with (OE = OF). 3. **Prove (OD = OF):** - Analogously to (OE = OF), consider the circle centered at (A): - By symmetry and similar arguments using arcs and angle subtensions, we find that (OD) and (OF) equate: - Triangle (ODF) by the same angle consideration is also isosceles, yielding (OD = OF). 4. **Conclude (O) is equidistant from (D), (E), and (F):** - From steps 1 and 3, (OE = OF), and (OD = OF) imply that: [ OE = OF = OD ] - Thus, (O) is equidistant from points (D), (E), and (F).

Initially, each vertex ( A_i ) is associated with a number ( a_i ). We are allowed to perform operations where for any sub-polygon of size ( k ), we add 1 to the numbers at its vertices. We aim to determine if it is possible to make all numbers at the vertices equal using such operations. **Step 1: Vector Representation of Vertices** 1. Consider a vector for each vertex pointing from the center ( O ) to the vertex ( A_i ), denoted as ( overrightarrow{OA_i} ). Due to the symmetry of the regular ( n )-gon, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^n overrightarrow{OA_i} = overrightarrow{0} ] This is because the vectors sum to zero due to their symmetric distribution around the center. **Step 2: Defining the Sum Vector ( vec{S} )** 2. Define the sum of the vectors weighted by the numbers at the vertices: [ vec{S} = sum_{i=1}^n a_i overrightarrow{OA_i} ] 3. According to the problem, each time an operation is performed by adding 1 to a ( k )-sided sub-polygon, it involves a summation of vectors that also symmetrically sum to zero. Hence, such operations do not change the overall sum ( vec{S} ). **Step 3: Initial Condition** 4. Initially, if we place the numbers such that there are ( n-1 ) zeros and one 1, we have: [ vec{S} = overrightarrow{OA_i} neq overrightarrow{0} ] This vector is nonzero because exactly one vertex has a different weight (which is 1), pointing in the direction of that vertex. **Step 4: Final Configuration** 5. Suppose it is possible to make all numbers at the vertices equal eventually, say each vertex has number ( b ).

To solve this problem, we will use a well-known combinatorial result called the \\"Marriage Theorem\\" (also known as Hall's Marriage Theorem). This theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. We will rephrase our problem in the language of bipartite graphs and then apply Hall's Marriage Theorem. 1. **Rephrasing the problem as a bipartite graph:** - Let the rows of the table be represented by (N) girls, and let the columns be represented by (N) boys. Suppose a boy ( j ) is \\"acquainted\\" with a girl ( i ) if the cell at the intersection of row (i) and column (j) contains a positive number. - We need to prove that there exists a perfect matching in this bipartite graph, i.e., we can pair each boy with a girl he is acquainted with, such that each boy and each girl is in exactly one pair. 2. **Applying Hall's Marriage Theorem:** - Hall's Theorem states that a perfect matching exists if and only if for every subset ( S ) of girls, the number of boys acquainted with at least one girl in ( S ) is at least as large as ( |S| ). Formally, for every subset ( S ) of girls, the neighborhood ( N(S) ) (set of boys acquainted with any girl in ( S )) must satisfy ( |N(S)| geq |S| ). 3. **Proof using Hall's condition:** - Consider any subset ( S ) of ( k ) girls. We need to show that ( |N(S)| geq k ). - Let us sum all the entries in the rows corresponding to the girls in ( S ). Since each row sums to 1, this total sum is ( k ). 4. **Counting contributions:** - Each boy ( j ) can contribute to this sum at most once for each girl ( i ) he is acquainted with (corresponding to a positive number in the table). - Hence, the sum of entries in the rows of ( S ) is equal to the sum of non-negative numbers corresponding to girls in ( S ) across all columns. - Each boy in ( N(S) ) (i.e., boys that are acquainted with at least one girl in ( S )) contributes at least one positive number to this sum, and since the total sum is ( k ), there must be at least ( k ) boys in ( N(S) ). Therefore, we have shown that for any subset ( S ) of girls, there are at least ( |S| ) boys acquainted with the girls in ( S ), establishing the condition required by Hall's Marriage Theorem. 5. **Conclusion:** - By Hall's Marriage Theorem, there exists a perfect matching between the boys and girls, which means we can find ( N ) distinct pairs (boy, girl) such that the corresponding cell in the table contains a positive number. - This ensures that it is possible to select ( N ) positive numbers such that no two are in the same row or column.

These boundary cells comprise: - 8 points along the top edge. - 8 points along the bottom edge. - 6 points along the left edge (excluding the already counted corners). - 6 points along the right edge (excluding the already counted corners). 2. **Total boundary points:** - Summing these, we have: [ 8 (text{top}) + 8 (text{bottom}) + 6 (text{left}) + 6 (text{right}) = 28 , text{boundary points}. ] 3. **Concept of intersection:** - Each straight line that separates regions will intersect the boundary of the square.

Given this, 13 lines can intersect the square up to: [ 13 times 2 = 26 , text{points}. ] 4. **Establishing maximum separations:** - These 13 lines can ideally create up to 26 separate regions if each pair of intersections subdivides the perimeter into a unique region. Hence, these lines would collectively subdivide the plane into up to: [ 26 , text{regions}. ] 5. **Analyzing the conclusion:** - Given that we have 28 boundary points and our subdivision with 13 lines maximally provides 26 distinct parts, at least 2 of these boundary points must reside within the same region. - Therefore, not all boundary points can be separated into distinct regions with only 13 lines. 6. **Extension to interior points:** - If it is impossible to separate just the 28 boundary centers, then it must also be impossible to comprehensively separate all 64 center points (including the interior points). Conclusion: - Thus, separating all points with only 13 lines is not feasible, and hence, purely geometrically, more than 13 lines (at least 14) would be needed to achieve complete separation of all the center points.

Next, we calculate how much Raymond has left and then how much he spent: - Raymond has 7 dimes left. Since each dime is worth 10 cents, the total amount Raymond has left is 7 times 10 = 70 cents. - Since Raymond initially received 2.50 from their grandmother, which is equal to 250 cents, and he has 70 cents left, the amount Raymond spent is 250 - 70 = 180 cents.

The perimeter of the triangle is given by: begin{aligned} a + b + c &= 2sqrt{3}sin A + 2sqrt{3}sin B + sqrt{3} &= 2sqrt{3}left(sin A + sinleft(frac{2π}{3} - Aright)right) + sqrt{3} &= 2sqrt{3}left(frac{3}{2}sin A + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos Aright) + sqrt{3} &= 2sqrt{3}sinleft(A + frac{π}{6}right) + sqrt{3}. end{aligned} Since C = frac{π}{3} and 0 < A < frac{2π}{3}, we have frac{π}{6} < A + frac{π}{6} < frac{5π}{6}, which implies frac{1}{2} < sin(A + frac{π}{6}) leq 1.

Step 1: Understand the Geometry 点 P 在 overparen{ACB} 关于 AB 对称的弧上，我们可以称这个弧为 arc_{P}。同理，点 Q 和 R 适用于类似的结论。由对称性， triangle PQR 的面积可以表述为triangle ABC 外接圆（直径是 triangle ABC 外接圆半径的两倍）上的等边三角形的最大面积。 Step 2: Relate to Inscribed Circle 考虑圆 C，其半径为单位面积的等边 triangle ABC 的外接圆半径的2倍。此时， triangle PQR 的最优解是该圆的内接等边三角形。 Step 3: Calculate the Maximum Area 实际操作中，可以选择点 P 关于 AB 的对称点 C；点 Q 关于 BC 的对称点 A；点 R 关于 CA 的对称点 B。这样， triangle PQR 可以分割成四个与 triangle ABC 面积相等的三角形。因此此时 triangle PQR 面积为 4 cdot triangle ABC 面积。 给定 triangle ABC 具有单位面积，所以： text{Area of } triangle PQR = 4 times text{Area of } triangle ABC = 4 times 1 = 4 结论 1: boxed{4} 2.

Since we are looking for a divisor that would make 859622 exactly divisible after subtracting 62, we can check each of these factors to see which one works. Let's divide 859560 (the number that is exactly divisible) by each of these factors: 1. 859560 ÷ 1 = 859560 (divisible, but 1 is not a meaningful divisor in this context) 2. 859560 ÷ 2 = 429780 (divisible) 3. 859560 ÷ 31 = 27727 (not divisible, as it does not result in a whole number) 4. 859560 ÷ 62 = 13861 (divisible) Since both 2 and 62 are divisors of 859560, we need to determine which one is the \\"certain divisor\\" mentioned in the question. Given that 62 is the difference subtracted from 859622 to get 859560, it is likely that 62 is the divisor we are looking for, as subtracting a multiple of the divisor from a number that is already divisible by that divisor would result in another number that is also divisible by the same divisor. Therefore, the divisor is boxed{62} ."},{"prompt":"Find the positive solution to the equation: [sqrt{x + sqrt{x + sqrt{x + dotsb}}} = sqrt{x sqrt{x sqrt{x dotsm}}}]","completion":"Let [y = sqrt{x + sqrt{x + sqrt{x + dotsb}}}] Then we have, [ y^2 = x + sqrt{x + sqrt{x + sqrt{x + dotsb}}} = x + y ] Thus, [ y^2 - y - x = 0 quad text{(1)}] Let [z = sqrt{x - sqrt{x - sqrt{x dotsm}}}] Then, [ z^2 = x - sqrt{x - sqrt{x - sqrt{x dotsm}}} = x - z ] So, [ z^2 + z - x = 0 quad text{(2)}] Equating (1) and (2) as y = z, gives: [ y^2 - y - x = z^2 + z - x = 0 ] Thus, simplifying gives: [ y^2 - y = z^2 + z ] Since y = z, then [ y^2 - y = y^2 + y ] This simplifies to [ -y = y ] Therefore, y = 0, however, y = 0 does not satisfy the original radical equations.

Prove that: [ n(p) - deg(p) leq 2 ] where ( deg(p) ) denotes the degree of the polynomial ( p(x) ). 1. **Expression Setup**: Since ( [p(x)]^2 = 1 ), we can write: [ [p(x)]^2 - 1 = 0 ] This implies: [ (p(x) - 1)(p(x) + 1) = 0 ] 2. **Roots Analysis**: The above equation shows that the integer roots are such that ( p(x) = 1 ) or ( p(x) = -1 ). Hence, if ( k ) is an integer root, it means ( p(k) = 1 ) or ( p(k) = -1 ). 3. **Algebraic Setup**: We need to show that the number of distinct integer roots where ( p(x) = 1 ) or ( p(x) = -1 ) is at most ( deg(p) + 2 ).

Substituting the point (1,frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) into the general equation of an ellipse frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, we get frac{1}{a^2}+frac{3}{4b^2}=1.

(For example if we take 2^7=128 , we find that S=11,R=2 . So in this case of 2^7 the searched digit will be 2 ).","completion":"1. **Define the function ( q(N) )**: The function ( q(N) ) represents the sum of the digits of ( N ). For example, if ( N = 128 ), then ( q(128) = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11 ). 2. **Understand the problem**: We need to repeatedly apply the function ( q ) to ( 2^{2004} ) until we reach a single digit number. This process can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic. 3. **Use properties of digit sum and modular arithmetic**: It is known that the sum of the digits of a number ( N ) is congruent to ( N mod 9 ). This is because: [ q(N) equiv N pmod{9} ] This property holds because the sum of the digits of a number is equivalent to the number itself modulo 9. 4. **Apply the property to ( 2^{2004} )**: We need to find ( 2^{2004} mod 9 ). To do this, we can use the fact that powers of 2 modulo 9 repeat in a cycle. Let's find the cycle: [ begin{align*} 2^1 &equiv 2 pmod{9}, 2^2 &equiv 4 pmod{9}, 2^3 &equiv 8 pmod{9}, 2^4 &equiv 16 equiv 7 pmod{9}, 2^5 &equiv 32 equiv 5 pmod{9}, 2^6 &equiv 64 equiv 1 pmod{9}. end{align*} ] We see that ( 2^6 equiv 1 pmod{9} ). This means that every 6th power of 2 is congruent to 1 modulo 9. 5. **Simplify the exponent**: Since ( 2^{2004} ) can be written as ( (2^6)^{334} times 2^0 ) (because ( 2004 = 6 times 334 )), we have: [ 2^{2004} equiv (2^6)^{334} equiv 1^{334} equiv 1 pmod{9}. ] 6. **Conclude the single digit**: Since ( 2^{2004} equiv 1 pmod{9} ), the repeated application of the function ( q ) will eventually reduce ( 2^{2004} ) to the single digit 1.

Simplify the term: [ x^2 + y^2 + 49 - xy + 7y + 7x = 0 ] Given the complexity, another possible solution is (x = y = -7) leading to: [ x + y = -14 ] 8.

This implies that event A is a subset of overline{B}, or in other words, A subseteq overline{B}. Therefore, the probability of A happening given that B does not happen is simply the probability of A, which is: [ P(Aoverline{B}) = P(A) = 0.6 ] 3. To find P(A + overline{B}), which represents the probability of either A or overline{B} happening (or both), we use the formula for the union of two events: [ P(A + overline{B}) = P(A) + P(overline{B}) - P(Aoverline{B}) ] Substituting the values we have: [ P(A + overline{B}) = 0.6 + 0.8 - 0.6 = 0.8 ] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{B: } 0.8}."},{"prompt":"Given that the domain of f(x) is symmetric about the origin, and f(x) = g(x) + h(x), where g(x) is an odd function and h(x) is an even function, express g(x) in terms of f(x).","completion":"Let's start with the given function, ( f(x) ), which can be written as the sum of an odd function ( g(x) ) and an even function ( h(x) ): [ f(x) = g(x) + h(x) ] 1. **Properties of odd and even functions:** - For an odd function ( g(x) ), we have: [ g(-x) = -g(x) ] - For an even function ( h(x) ), we have: [ h(-x) = h(x) ] 2. **Express ( f(-x) ):** Using the properties of ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ), we can write: [ f(-x) = g(-x) + h(-x) ] Substituting the properties of odd and even functions, we get: [ f(-x) = -g(x) + h(x) ] 3. **Solving for ( g(x) ):** We now have the following two equations: [ f(x) = g(x) + h(x) ] [ f(-x) = -g(x) + h(x) ] To eliminate ( h(x) ) and solve for ( g(x) ), add the above equations: [ f(x) + f(-x) = (g(x) + h(x)) + (-g(x) + h(x)) ] Simplifying the right side, we get: [ f(x) + f(-x) = h(x) + h(x) = 2 h(x) ] Therefore: [ h(x) = frac{f(x) + f(-x)}{2} ] Now, subtract the equation ( f(x) = g(x) + h(x) ) from ( f(-x) = h(x) - g(x) ) (equation subtracted term by term): [ f(x) - f(-x) = (g(x) + h(x)) - (h(x) - g(x)) ] Simplifying the right side, we get: [ f(x) - f(-x) = g(x) + h(x) - h(x) + g(x) = 2 g(x) ] Therefore: [ g(x) = frac{f(x) - f(-x)}{2} ] Hence, the function ( g(x) ) in terms of ( f(x) ) is: [ boxed{g(x) = frac{f(x) - f(-x)}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"The 2007 AMC 10 will be scored by awarding 8 points for each correct response, 2 points for each incorrect response, and 2 points for each problem left unanswered.

Instead, we can use a property of modular arithmetic known as Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if (p) is a prime number and (a) is an integer not divisible by (p), then (a^{(p-1)} equiv 1 mod p). Since 379 is a prime number and 6 is not divisible by 379, we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem: (6^{378} equiv 1 mod 379) Now, we can express 97 as a multiple of 378 plus a remainder: (97 = 378 cdot 0 + 97) So, we can write (6^{97}) as: (6^{97} = (6^{378})^0 cdot 6^{97}) Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that (6^{378} equiv 1 mod 379), so we only need to find the remainder of (6^{97}) modulo 379. Since 97 is less than 378, we can't directly apply Fermat's Little Theorem to reduce the exponent further. At this point, we can either continue with manual calculations or use a computer to calculate (6^{97} mod 379).

Determine if there exists a point ( P ) on the hyperbola such that the centroid ( G ) and the incenter ( I ) of triangle ( triangle PF_{1}F_{2} ) are parallel to the focal axis ( F_{1}F_{2} ). 2.

Problem 1 Solution: 1. Start by identifying the foci ( F_{1} ) and ( F_{2} ) of the hyperbola. - For a standard hyperbola ( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), the distance of each focus from the center is ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). - Here, ( a = 2 ) and ( b = sqrt{5} ), so the distance to each focus is ( sqrt{4 + 5} = 3 ). 2. Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are: ( F_{1}(-3, 0) ) and ( F_{2}(3, 0) ). 3. Assume ( P ) is a point on the hyperbola in the first quadrant. Let ( P = (x_0, y_0) ). - Use the hyperbola equation to express ( y_0 ): ( frac{x_0^2}{4} - frac{y_0^2}{5} = 1 ). 4.

To determine if ( IG parallel F_{1}F_{2} ), ( G ) must lie on the line perpendicular to ( F_{1}F_{2} ). Since ( F_{1}F_{2} ) is horizontal, this criterion simplifies checking if ( G ) aligns vertically aligned in a specific way.

Decimals under radicals are generally not considered in their simplest form because they can often be expressed as fractions, which can then be simplified. Thus, sqrt{0.2} is not the simplest quadratic radical. **Option C:** sqrt{8a} - This expression can be simplified by factoring out the square root of a perfect square. We can rewrite 8a as 4*2a, which gives us: [ sqrt{8a} = sqrt{4*2a} = sqrt{4}sqrt{2a} = 2sqrt{2a} ] - Since we were able to simplify the expression, it is not in its simplest quadratic radical form. **Option D:** sqrt{9} - This expression is the square root of a perfect square, which simplifies to: [ sqrt{9} = 3 ] - Since the result is no longer under a radical, it is not considered a quadratic radical in its simplest form.

Then the condition becomes: [ 0^2 + 0^2 - c^2 mid P(0) + P(0) - P(c) implies -c^2 mid 2P(0) - P(c). ] This implies: [ c^2 mid P(c) - 2P(0). ] Therefore, for all integers (c), (c^2) must divide (P(c) - 2P(0)). 3. **Form of the Polynomial:** Since (c^2 mid P(c) - 2P(0)), we can write: [ P(c) = 2P(0) + c^2 Q(c), ] where (Q(c)) is some polynomial with integer coefficients. 4. **Degree Consideration:** Let (P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0). Given that (c^2 mid P(c) - 2P(0)), the leading term (a_n x^n) must be divisible by (x^2). This implies (n leq 2). 5. **Case Analysis:** - **Case (n = 0):** (P(x) = a_0). This is a constant polynomial. For any constant polynomial, (P(a) + P(b) - P(c) = 3a_0 - a_0 = 2a_0), which is not generally divisible by (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) unless (a_0 = 0). Thus, (P(x) = 0). - **Case (n = 1):** (P(x) = a_1 x + a_0). For linear polynomials, (P(a) + P(b) - P(c) = a_1(a + b - c) + 2a_0). This is not generally divisible by (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) unless (a_1 = 0) and (a_0 = 0). Thus, (P(x) = 0). - **Case (n = 2):** (P(x) = a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0). For quadratic polynomials, we need to check if (a^2 + b^2 - c^2 mid P(a) + P(b) - P(c)).
