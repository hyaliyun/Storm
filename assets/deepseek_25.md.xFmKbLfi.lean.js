The prime factorization of the numbers from 2 to 12 is: - 2 = 2 - 3 = 3 - 4 = 2^2 - 5 = 5 - 6 = 2 * 3 - 7 = 7 - 8 = 2^3 - 9 = 3^2 - 10 = 2 * 5 - 11 = 11 - 12 = 2^2 * 3 The LCM is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 8 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 11 = 2520. So, the number we are looking for is 1 less than a multiple of 2520. The smallest such number greater than 10,000 is 2520 * 4 + 2519 = 10079. Now we need to check if 10079 is not a perfect square and if its digits sum to a prime number. The digits of 10079 sum to 1 + 0 + 0 + 7 + 9 = 17, which is a prime number. To check if 10079 is a perfect square, we can look for a whole number that when squared gives 10079. The square root of 10079 is approximately 100.39, which is not a whole number, so 10079 is not a perfect square. Therefore, boxed{10079} satisfies all the given conditions."},{"prompt":"The number m is a prime number between 30 and 50. If you divide m by 12, the remainder is 7.

Next, we need to check if 31 and 43 are prime numbers: - 31 is divisible only by 1 and itself, so it is prime. - 43 is divisible only by 1 and itself, so it is also prime.

This means the ratio of the base areas of the cylinder and the rectangular prism is 6:8, or simplified to 3:4. Given that the sum of the base areas of the two containers is 98 square centimeters, we can find the base area of the cylinder by distributing the total area in proportion to this ratio. Let the base area of the cylinder be A_c and the base area of the rectangular prism be A_r. According to the problem, we have the ratio A_c : A_r = 3:4. Since the sum of their base areas is 98 square centimeters, we can write the equation: [A_c + A_r = 98] Given the ratio A_c : A_r = 3:4, we can express A_c as frac{3}{3+4} times 98 = frac{3}{7} times 98 = 42 square centimeters.

In this system: - All points on the periphery of the left roller move with the same speed ( v ). - The surface moves horizontally to the left with speed ( v ). - The point of contact with the plate also has this speed ( v ), but it is directed at an angle ( alpha ) to the horizontal to the right. 2. **Relative Motion:** - In the same coordinate system, the point of contact of the second roller (right roller) with the plate also has speed ( v ) directed at ( alpha ). - Consequently, the plate appears to move along itself with speed ( v cos(alpha) ). 3. **Absolute Coordinate System:** - In an absolute coordinate system (connected to the surface), for each motion observed, we add horizontal speed ( v ). - Thus, ( v cos(alpha) ) becomes ( 2v cos(alpha/2) ). 4. **Energy Conservation and Kinematics:** - As the plate descends (drops) by height ( h ): - Using the conservation of energy, the speed becomes ( sqrt{2gh} ). - For ( alpha = arccos(0.68) ), the corresponding sine value must be computed. 5. **Calculating the Sine of the Angle:** - Given ( alpha = arccos(0.68) ), we need ( sin(alpha/2) ). 6. **Kinematic Formula:** - From energy conservation, the kinematics of the system yields: [ v^2 = 2as ] where ( s = h/sin(alpha/2) ). 7. **Plate Acceleration:** - Using: [ a = g sin(alpha/2) ] 8. **Simplified Answer:** - Recognizing that ( alpha = arccos(0.68) ): - We get ( sin(alpha/2) = sqrt{frac{1 - cos(alpha)}{2}} ). Therefore, the magnitude and direction of the plate's acceleration are represented as: [ boxed{4 mathrm{, m/s^2}; arcsin(0.4)} ] Thus, for the acceleration of the rollers given by ( a = g sin(alpha/2) ), determining the sine value provides the required rollers' acceleration ( 4 , text{m/s}^2 )."},{"prompt":"For variables x, y that are linearly related, there is a set of observation data (x_i, y_i) (i=1,2,ldots,6), and the regression line equation is hat y= frac {1}{4}x+a.

The coordinates of E are found using the midpoint formula: [ E = left( frac{x_A + x_C}{2}, frac{y_A + y_C}{2} right) ] 4. **Second Diagonal Properties**: In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Thus, the midpoint E of diagonal AC will also be the midpoint of the other diagonal BD. 5. **Perpendicular Bisector Technique**: Since B and D lie on a given circle and must be specified such that BD passes through E, draw the perpendicular bisector of AC through E. This line will pass through points B and D. 6. **Intersection Points with Circle**: The line passing through E perpendicular to AC will intersect the given circle at points B and D.

Therefore, the number of people who are less than 20 years old is the total number of people minus the number of people more than 30 years old: Number of people less than 20 years old = Total number of people - Number of people more than 30 years old Number of people less than 20 years old = 120 - 90 Number of people less than 20 years old = 30 Now, to find the probability that a randomly selected person is less than 20 years old, we divide the number of people less than 20 years old by the total number of people: Probability (person is less than 20) = Number of people less than 20 years old / Total number of people Probability (person is less than 20) = 30 / 120 To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 30: Probability (person is less than 20) = 1 / 4 So, the probability that a randomly selected person from the group is less than 20 years old is boxed{1/4} or 0.25 (which is equivalent to 25%)."},{"prompt":"The squares of an 8 times 8 chessboard are numbered somehow with the numbers from 1 to 64.

Consider an arbitrary numbering of the squares on an 8 times 8 chessboard with the numbers from 1 to 64. 2. Place a chess piece, specifically the king (which can move one step to any neighboring square, including diagonals) on the square numbered 1. 3. Observe that from any starting position, the king can reach any square on the board within a maximum of 7 moves. Let us denote the square numbered 64 as the target. 4. During the king's journey from square 1 to square 64, the path he follows will involve a sequence of neighboring squares, and we will calculate the sum of the differences between numbers on these squares. 5. Since the king must move at most 7 times, the sum of the absolute differences in the numbers on these squares will be at least 63, because 64 - 1 = 63. 6. Therefore, if the maximum number difference per move is 8, then the sum of differences in 7 moves is at most 7 times 8 = 56. 7. However, since the total difference the king must achieve is 63, this means that at least one step must have a difference that is 9 or greater (because 7 times 8 = 56 is less than 63). 8. This implies that no matter how the board is numbered, there will always be at least one pair of neighboring squares with a difference of at least 9. 9.

Additionally: - Diagonally neighboring squares differ by 7 or 9. 12. Verify that it is impossible to have a neighboring difference larger than 9 in this numbering: - The differences found in this numbering (1, 8, 7, 9) effectively cover the required maximum without exceeding 9. 13.

Let us fix one angle, say C, and explore the inequality with the remaining angles A and B such that A + B = 180^circ - C. 2. **Trigonometric transformation:** Using the angle sum identity and properties of sine, we can express the sum of sines as follows: [ sin A + sin B + sin C = 2 sin left(frac{A+B}{2}right) cos left(frac{A-B}{2}right) + sin C. ] Since A + B = 180^circ - C, we have: [ sin A + sin B + sin C = 2 sin left(frac{180^circ - C}{2}right) cos left(frac{A-B}{2}right) + sin C = 2 cos left(frac{C}{2}right) cos left(frac{A-B}{2}right) + sin C. ] 3. **Symmetry argument:** For a fixed value of C, the maximum value of cos left(frac{A-B}{2}right) is 1, which occurs when A = B.

Since triangle (ABC) is isosceles with (AB = BC) and (angle BAC = 44^circ), triangle (AYM) is congruent to triangle (ABC). This follows from the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion for congruence: (AY = AB), (AM = AC) (since (AM = AC)), and (angle YAM = angle BAC = 44^circ). 3. Therefore, (angle AYM = 44^circ) and (MY = AB = XM). 4. Since (MY = XM), triangle (XMY) is isosceles. Therefore, the base angles (angle YXM = angle XMY = 44^circ). 5. Let point (Z) be the point symmetric to (M) with respect to line (AC). Then, (AZ = AM = BN) and (angle ZAB + angle B = 2 angle A + angle B = 180^circ). 6. Thus, quadrilateral (ABNZ) is a parallelogram (opposite angles add up to (180^circ)). 7. Consequently, (ZN = AB = XM = XZ), making triangle (XZN) isosceles. Also, (angle AZN = angle ABN = 44^circ), and (angle A = 68^circ) (since (angle BAC = 44^circ) implies (angle BCA = 68^circ)). 8.

Since ( i ) and ( (i + j) mod n ) are different (as ( j neq 0 )), the vertex and the edge pointing to it are colored differently. - **Edge-Edge Coloring**: Consider any vertex ( v_i ). The edges ( v_i v_j ) and ( v_i v_{j'} ) are colored with ( (i + j) mod n ) and ( (i + j') mod n ) respectively. If these two edges have the same color, then: [ (i + j) mod n = (i + j') mod n ] This implies: [ i + j equiv i + j' pmod{n} ] Simplifying, we get: [ j equiv j' pmod{n} ] Since ( j ) and ( j' ) are both in the range ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ), this means ( j = j' ).

For k > 0, the sign of f'(x) and the monotonicity of f(x) can be summarized as follows: - For x in (-infty, -k), f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is increasing. - For x in (-k, k), f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is decreasing. - For x in (k, +infty), f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is increasing again. Therefore, the monotonic increasing intervals of f(x) are (-infty, -k) and (k, +infty), and the monotonic decreasing interval is (-k, k). For k < 0, the sign of f'(x) and the monotonicity of f(x) change accordingly: - For x in (-infty, k), f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is decreasing. - For x in (k, -k), f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is increasing. - For x in (-k, +infty), f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is decreasing again.

For k < 0, the maximum value of f(x) on (0, +infty) is at x = -k, where f(-k) = frac{4k^2}{e}.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Understand the Shape:** A regular triangular prism consists of two equilateral triangles (bases) and three rectangular faces connecting corresponding edges of the two triangles. 2. **Measure the Edges:** - Let a be the length of an edge of the equilateral triangular bases. - The edges of the prism extending vertically (side edges) are generally denoted with a height, and in this specific problem, they are sqrt{3} times the base edges. - Therefore, the side edge length h is given by: [ h = asqrt{3} ] 3. **Properties of the Development (Net):** - We need to develop a net of this prism, which shows all faces connected in a 2D plane. - A net of this triangular prism would consist of the top and bottom equilateral triangle bases, and three rectangular sides. 4. **Transform the Rectangular Faces:** - Since the side faces are rectangles with one side a (same as the base edge) and the other side length asqrt{3}, we need to determine if they can be subdivided into equilateral triangles. - A rectangle dimensions a times asqrt{3} can be exactly divided into 3 small equilateral triangles each with side length a, because: [ text{Height of each triangle} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a ] and 3 such heights would perfectly match asqrt{3}. 5. **Arrange the Triangles:** - If we lay down one of the rectangular side faces of the triangular prism, it would look like three equilateral triangles aligned together. - The net of the prism consisting of these three side faces would be three sets of these aligned equilateral triangles. 6. **Combine with Bases:** - Since the base triangles are already equilateral triangles, they perfectly conform with the notion of covering the shape with equilateral triangles. 7. **Conclusion:** - Taking into account all these faces requested in the net, every part of the net is perfectly tiled with equilateral triangles as depicted in the following development (Figure). Thus, it shows that it is indeed possible to cover the entire surface of a regular triangular prism with different equilateral triangles without overlap. # Conclusion: The solution shows that a regular triangular prism whose side edges are sqrt{3} times the base edges can indeed be wrapped with equilateral triangles precisely by dividing the rectangular sides into the required number of smaller equilateral triangles.

This is greater than the direct distance between F_{1} and F_{2}, which is |F_{1}F_{2}|=4. Therefore, the locus of the center M forms an ellipse with foci at F_{1} and F_{2}, and the major axis length is 8. From this, we can deduce: - The semi-major axis a=4, - The distance between the foci 2c=4 Rightarrow c=2, - The semi-minor axis can be found using b^{2}=a^{2}-c^{2}=16-4=12. Thus, the equation of the ellipse is frac{{x}^{2}}{16}+frac{{y}^{2}}{12}=1. However, the moving circle M does not exist when its center is at the left vertex of the ellipse, so we exclude this case. Therefore, the equation of the locus C of the center M is boxed{frac{{x}^{2}}{16}+frac{{y}^{2}}{12}=1;(x≠-4)}. Part (2): Let the points of intersection of the line l with the locus C be A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}). Given that Q(2,-1) is the midpoint of segment AB, we have the midpoint formula implying x_{1}+x_{2}=4 and y_{1}+y_{2}=-2. From the equations of the ellipse for points A and B, we have: - frac{{x}_{1}^{2}}{16}+frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{12}=1 - frac{{x}_{2}^{2}}{16}+frac{{y}_{2}^{2}}{12}=1 Subtracting these equations gives: frac{{x}_{1}^{2}-{x}_{2}^{2}}{16}+frac{{y}_{1}^{2}-{y}_{2}^{2}}{12}=0 This simplifies to: frac{({x}_{1}+{x}_{2})({x}_{1}-{x}_{2})}{16}+frac{({y}_{1}+{y}_{2})({y}_{1}-{y}_{2})}{12}=0 Substituting x_{1}+x_{2}=4 and y_{1}+y_{2}=-2 into this equation, we find the slope of line l as k=frac{{y}_{1}-{y}_{2}}{{x}_{1}-{x}_{2}}=frac{3}{2}. Therefore, the equation of line l, using the point-slope form with point Q(2,-1), is: y-(-1)=frac{3}{2}(x-2) Simplifying this equation gives: boxed{3x-2y-8=0}"},{"prompt":"Emma, Bridget, Cassie, and Hannah are discussing the results of their last math test.

The conversion factor is: 1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in meters per second (m/s) is: 45 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 45 * (1000 / 3600) m/s 45 * (10 / 36) m/s = 450 / 36 m/s 45 * (5 / 18) m/s = 225 / 18 m/s 12.5 m/s Now, we know the train takes 30 seconds to cross the bridge. The distance the train covers in 30 seconds at a speed of 12.5 m/s is: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 12.5 m/s * 30 s Distance = 375 meters This distance is the combined length of the train and the bridge.

To explore this, consider the set M = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}. 2. **Verification of Properties:** We need to verify that within the set M = {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}, for any three elements we pick, there exist two elements whose sum is also in the set M. Let's examine all combinations of three numbers from the set: - For {-3, -2, -1}: Possible sums are -5 (not in M), -4 (not in M), and -3 (in M). - For {-3, -2, 0}: Possible sums are -3 (in M), -5 (not in M), and -2 (in M). - For {-3, -2, 1}: Possible sums are -4 (not in M), -2 (in M), and -1 (in M). - For {-3, -2, 2}: Possible sums are -1 (in M), -3 (in M), and 0 (in M). - For {-3, -2, 3}: Possible sums are 0 (in M), -1 (in M), and 1 (in M). - Continuing similarly for all other groups...

The factors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90. Out of these, 9 and 10 are given as the other two factors of the l.c.m, and they are co-prime. So, we can take m = 9 and n = 10.

Let's denote the selling price of both books as SP. The selling price of the book sold at a gain (SP) can be calculated as: SP = C2 + (19% of C2) SP = C2 + (0.19 * C2) SP = C2 * (1 + 0.19) SP = Rs. 175 * (1 + 0.19) SP = Rs. 175 * 1.19 SP = Rs. 208.25 Since both books were sold at the same price, the selling price of the book sold at a loss (SP) is also Rs. 208.25. Now, let's calculate the loss percentage on the book sold at a loss. We know the cost (C1) and the selling price (SP), so we can find the loss amount (L) and then the loss percentage (LP). Loss amount (L) = Cost of the book sold at a loss (C1) - Selling price (SP) L = Rs. 245 - Rs. 208.25 L = Rs. 36.75 The loss percentage (LP) is calculated as: LP = (Loss amount (L) / Cost of the book sold at a loss (C1)) * 100% LP = (Rs. 36.75 / Rs. 245) * 100% LP = (0.15) * 100% LP = 15% Therefore, the loss percentage on the book sold at a loss is boxed{15%} ."},{"prompt":"Let ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) be given by [ f(x)=frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{x2}+frac{1}{x4}+cdots+frac{1}{x2018} ] and [ g(x)=frac{1}{x1}+frac{1}{x3}+frac{1}{x5}+cdots+frac{1}{x2017}. ] Prove that [ |f(x)g(x)| > 2 ] for any noninteger real number ( x ) satisfying ( 0 < x < 2018 ).","completion":"We begin by analyzing the two functions ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) given by: f(x) = frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{x-2} + frac{1}{x-4} + cdots + frac{1}{x-2018}, and g(x) = frac{1}{x-1} + frac{1}{x-3} + cdots + frac{1}{x-2017}. We want to prove that: |f(x) - g(x)| > 2 for any non-integer real number ( x ) satisfying ( 0 < x < 2018 ). Step 1: Symmetry of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) Notice that: f(2018 - x) = -f(x) and g(2018 - x) = -g(x). This shows that a half-turn about the point ( (1009,0) ) preserves the graphs of both ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ). Hence, it suffices to consider only the case ( 2n - 1 < x < 2n ).

Step 3: Simplify the problem for ( 1 < x < 2 ) We analyze the interval ( 1 < x < 2 ), where ( d(x) ) can be written as: d(x) = frac{1}{x-1} + frac{1}{x-3} - frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{x-2}. This reduces our task to prove: frac{1}{x-1} + frac{1}{x-3} - frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{x-2} > 2.

Putting it all together: [ F(k, n) = F(k-1, n-1) + 9 F(k, n-1) ] By the assumption of our induction hypothesis, the quantities F(k-1, n-1) and F(k, n-1) do not depend upon the specific composition of X, as they only rely on the lengths k and n. # Conclusion: We have shown both the base case and the inductive step, so by the principle of mathematical induction, the proposition holds true for all n. The number of n-digit numbers from which a given k-digit number X can be obtained by deleting digits depends only on k and n, not on the particular number X.

According to the problem, the washer costs ( D + 220 ) dollars. The total cost of the washer-dryer combination is given as 1,200 dollars. Therefore, the sum of the cost of the washer and the cost of the dryer is 1,200 dollars. So we can write the equation: ( D + (D + 220) = 1,200 ) Combining like terms, we get: ( 2D + 220 = 1,200 ) Subtracting 220 from both sides of the equation, we get: ( 2D = 1,200 - 220 ) ( 2D = 980 ) Dividing both sides by 2, we get: ( D = 490 ) Now that we have the cost of the dryer, we can find the cost of the washer by adding 220 dollars to the cost of the dryer: ( Washer Cost = D + 220 ) ( Washer Cost = 490 + 220 ) ( Washer Cost = 710 ) Therefore, the washer costs boxed{710} dollars."},{"prompt":"A rectangular prism has dimensions 9 inches by 3 inches by 27 inches.

This distance is twice the radius of the fragrance spread: [ text{Maximum distance between adjacent bushes} = 2 times 20 text{ meters} = 40 text{ meters}. ] 4. **Dividing the Alley into Segments**: - Given that the total length of the alley is 400 meters and each segment of 40 meters along which the fragrance of a bush spreads should be covered: [ text{Number of segments} = frac{400 text{ meters}}{40 text{ meters per segment}} = 10. ] 5. **Distributing the Bushes**: - We need a bush at the beginning of each 40-meter segment to ensure fragrance coverage.

Since the month started on a Sunday and there are 30 days in the month, there will be: - 4 full weeks (4 Sundays and 20 weekdays) - 2 extra days which will be Monday and Tuesday (2 weekdays) So, we have: - Sundays: 4 days - Weekdays: 20 + 2 = 22 days - Holidays: 4 days (which are not Sundays) Now, let's calculate the total number of visitors for each type of day: 1. Sundays: 4 Sundays * 540 visitors = 2160 visitors 2. Weekdays (excluding holidays): Since there are 4 holidays, there are 22 - 4 = 18 regular weekdays. 18 weekdays * 240 visitors = 4320 visitors 3. Holidays: The increase in visitors during holidays is 25% more than on weekdays.

From Equation 3, we can express l in terms of h: l = 288 / h Substitute l in Equation 2 with the above expression: (288 / h) * w * h = 5184 This simplifies to: 288 * w = 5184 w = 5184 / 288 w = 18 Now, we can find l using Equation 3: l * h = 288 Substitute h with (1/2) * l from Equation 1: l * ((1/2) * l) = 288 (1/2) * l^2 = 288 l^2 = 576 l = √576 l = 24 Now we have the values for w and l, we can find the ratio: 2 * w / l = 2 * 18 / 24 This simplifies to: 36 / 24 Which reduces to: 3 / 2 So, the ratio of the area of the top face to the area of the side face is boxed{3:2} ."},{"prompt":"Given the inequality about x: |2xm| leq 1 has exactly one integer solution, which is 2.

The derivative of a function at a certain point x=a is defined as the limit of the average rate of change (or the increment ratio of the function) as the change in the independent variable approaches zero, if this limit exists. In other words, if we have a function f(x) and we consider a point x=a and a small increment h such that we look at x=a+h, the average rate of change from x=a to x=a+h is given by frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}. As h approaches 0, this average rate of change approaches the instantaneous rate of change, which is the derivative at x=a: f'(a) = lim_{h to 0} frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}. Therefore: - Option A describes the ratio of the increment, which is related to the definition of the derivative but is not complete without considering the limit as h approaches 0. - Option B, stating that the derivative is a function, is not accurate when speaking about the derivative at a specific point. - Option C is the most accurate as the derivative at a point is indeed a constant, representing the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point, and is not variable. - Option D describes the average rate of change over an interval, which is related to the derivative in the sense that the derivative is the limit of the average rate of change as the interval shrinks to a point. The correct answer is therefore C. The derivative at a point is a specific value (a constant) representing the slope of the tangent to the function at that point. So, the solution is: The derivative of a function at a certain point is a specific value, or a constant, that represents the slope of the tangent to the function's curve at that point. It is an instantaneous rate of change, which is different from an average rate of change over an interval. The definition of the derivative does not imply that the derivative itself is a function when considered at a single point. Therefore, while it is related to the average rate of change between two points, it is not equal to it.

Since \\"billion\\" is already 10^9, we don't need to adjust the exponent further for the conversion of 2135 to 2.135. Therefore, the correct conversion is: [2135 text{ billion} = 2135 times 10^9 = 2.135 times 10^{3} times 10^9 = 2.135 times 10^{9+3} = 2.135 times 10^{12}] However, this calculation is incorrect based on the original solution provided.

This means that for every 5 bundles, the owner incurs an additional cost of 1.00. The total cost for 5 bundles, including the complimentary snack, is: - Cost of 5 bundles = 5 x 4.00 = 20.00 - Cost of complimentary snack = 1.00 Total cost for 5 bundles with the complimentary snack = 20.00 + 1.00 = 21.00 However, the 5th bundle is sold for 2.00, which means the owner receives 2.00 instead of the regular price for that bundle. Therefore, we need to subtract this amount from the total revenue expected from 5 bundles at the regular price. Let's assume the regular price for the bundle is P dollars. The revenue from selling 5 bundles at the regular price would be 5P dollars. But since the 5th bundle is sold for 2.00, the actual revenue is (4P + 2.00).

We are given multiple points: (A(x_1, y_1)), (B left(4, frac{9}{5}right)), and (C(x_2, y_2)), all of which lie on the ellipse. Additionally, we know: - ( |AF| = 5 - frac{4}{5} x_1 ) - ( |CF| = 5 - frac{4}{5} x_2 ) 3. From the problem, we know: 2|BF| = |AF| + |CF| Let's calculate ( |BF| ): BF = sqrt{(4-4)^2 + left(frac{9}{5} - 0right)^2} = frac{9}{5} Therefore: 2 times frac{9}{5} = 5 - frac{4}{5}x_1 + 5 - frac{4}{5}x_2 Simplifying this, we get: frac{18}{5} = 10 - frac{4}{5}(x_1 + x_2) Now, isolate (x_1 + x_2): frac{4}{5}(x_1 + x_2) = 10 - frac{18}{5} = frac{50}{5} - frac{18}{5} = frac{32}{5} Thus: x_1 + x_2 = 8 4. The equation of the vertical bisector (A C) is: y - frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = -frac{x_1 - x_2}{y_1 - y_2}left( x - frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) 5. By setting (y = 0) to find intersection point (T): 0 - frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = -frac{x_1 - x_2}{y_1 - y_2} left( x_T - frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) Solving for (x_T): x_T = frac{y_1^2 - y_2^2}{2(x_1 - x_2)} + frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} 6. Given (A, C) are on ellipse: begin{array}{l} 9 x_1^2 + 25 y_1^2 = 225 9 x_2^2 + 25 y_2^2 = 225 end{array} Subtracting, we get: 25(y_1^2 - y_2^2) = -9(x_1^2 - x_2^2) Factoring the right side: -9(x_1^2 - x_2^2) = -9(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 - x_2) 7. Hence: frac{y_1^2 - y_2^2}{x_1 - x_2} = -frac{9}{25}(x_1 + x_2) 8. Substituting this in (x_T) gives an expression: x_T = -frac{9}{25} cdot frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} + frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = frac{16}{25} cdot 8 = frac{64}{25} 9. Finally, slope ( k_{BT} ): k_{BT} = frac{frac{9}{5}}{4 - frac{64}{25}} = frac{frac{9}{5}}{frac{100 - 64}{25}} = frac{frac{9}{5}}{frac{36}{25}} = frac{9}{5} cdot frac{25}{36} = frac{45}{36} = frac{5}{4} # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{5}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"James buys some packs of beef that are 4 pounds each.

Now we can use the value of ( t ) to find ( m ) from the equation for Car X: ( 35 times (1.96 + m) = 98 ) ( 68.6 + 35m = 98 ) ( 35m = 98 - 68.6 ) ( 35m = 29.4 ) ( m = frac{29.4}{35} ) ( m = 0.84 ) hours.

Denote the countries by ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_n ). Let ( n_k ) be the number of representatives from country ( C_k ). The total number of representatives is ( N = sum_{k=1}^n n_k ). 2. **Base case for induction:** For ( n = 2 ), we need to show that the maximal number of representatives is ( 2^2 = 4 ). Consider the representatives ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ) from countries ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) respectively. A valid arrangement is ( (r_1, r_2, r_1, r_2) ). This satisfies the condition that no two representatives from the same country have their neighbors to the right from the same country. 3. **Inductive hypothesis:** Assume that for ( n ) countries, the maximal number of representatives that can sit around the table is ( n^2 ). This means we have a valid arrangement ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n^2}) ) where each country ( C_k ) has exactly ( n ) representatives. 4. **Inductive step:** We need to show that for ( n+1 ) countries, the maximal number of representatives is ( (n+1)^2 ). Consider the valid arrangement for ( n ) countries. Each country ( C_k ) has ( n ) representatives, and the total number of representatives is ( n^2 ). 5. **Constructing the arrangement for ( n+1 ) countries:** Introduce representatives from the new country ( C_{n+1} ). We need to place these representatives in such a way that the condition is still satisfied. Replace each pair ( (r_k, r_k) ) in the original arrangement as follows: - For ( k = 1 ), replace ( (r_1, r_1) ) with ( (r_1, r_{n+1}, r_{n+1}, r_1, r_1) ). - For ( k ge 2 ), replace ( (r_k, r_k) ) with ( (r_k, r_{n+1}, r_k, r_k) ). 6. **Verify the new arrangement:** The new arrangement has ( n^2 + 3 + 2(n-1) = (n+1)^2 ) representatives. This is because we added 3 representatives for the first pair and 2 representatives for each of the remaining ( n-1 ) pairs. The new arrangement satisfies the condition that no two representatives from the same country have their neighbors to the right from the same country. 7. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for every ( n ), the maximal number of representatives that can sit around the table is ( n^2 ).

Therefore, before the member died, the total monthly income of the family was Rs 1300 + Rs 905 = Rs 2205. Since this was the total income when there were 3 earning members, we can find the initial average monthly income per earning member by dividing this total income by 3: Initial average monthly income per earning member = Total income / Number of earning members A = Rs 2205 / 3 A = Rs 735 So the initial average monthly income per earning member was Rs boxed{735} ."},{"prompt":"The number of integer solutions to the equation (x^2 x 1)^{x + 2} = 1 is.","completion":"(1) When x + 2 = 0 and x^2 - x - 1 neq 0, we find x = -2; (2) When x^2 - x - 1 = 1, we find x = 2 or x = -1; (3) When x^2 - x - 1 = -1 and x + 2 is even, we find x = 0.

In this case, not exactly one of the two mentioned individuals is a liar, which is consistent with the given condition (as all are liars). Therefore, having 450 liars is feasible. - Thus, one possible solution is that all 450 individuals are liars. 3. **Assume there is at least one knight:** - Knights always tell the truth. If there were at least one knight, each knight would assert that exactly one liar exists in the two-person groups they mentioned. This scenario would break the sequence because: - A knight finds a liar to their right. - The person immediately to the right of the liar should be a knight. - Continuing this logic in a clockwise manner around the table would lead to a specific pattern involving knights and liars. 4. **Determine a feasible pattern:** - Suppose every third person is a liar. The pattern would form \\"knight, liar, knight.\\" - If we divide knights and liars in this cycle, the statement made by each aligns with given conditions: - For a knight, the person to the right is a liar. - The person immediately next to the liar is a knight. - Each group pattern thus satisfies the knight’s truth-telling condition. To verify: - The total number of liars is one-third of the 450 islanders. - Number of liars = (frac{450}{3} = 150). Since we have identified splitting a total of 450 into repeating cycles of \\"knight, liar, knight\\" as a valid pattern, there are 150 liars, another feasible solution.

If a ≤ 0, f(x) is decreasing on (-∞, frac{1 - sqrt{1 - 4a}}{2}) and increasing on (frac{1 - sqrt{1 - 4a}}{2}, 1).

Therefore, according to the given condition a^{b}=b^{a}, we get 4^{2}=2^{4}. This satisfies the initial condition. However, selecting arbitrary values for a and b like 4 and 2 is not a methodology that can be generalized for any a and b. To solve the problem, let's take a different approach. First, let's take the logarithm to the base e of both sides of the equation a^{b}=b^{a}: ln(a^b) = ln(b^a) bln(a) = aln(b) Since a > b > 0, ln(a) > ln(b). Let's divide both sides of the equation by ln(a) cdot ln(b): frac{b}{ln(b)} = frac{a}{ln(a)} Consider the function f(x) = frac{x}{ln(x)} with its derivative f'(x). Derive f'(x) to find: f'(x) = frac{ln(x) - (frac{x}{x})}{(ln(x))^2} = frac{ln(x) - 1}{(ln(x))^2} Since ln(x) > 1 for x > e, and ln(x) < 1 for 0 < x < e, the derivative f'(x) is positive for x>e and negative for 0<x<e. This indicates that f(x) is increasing when x > e and decreasing when 0 < x < e. Moreover, f(x) has a minimum at x = e. Therefore, if a is not equal to b, it's impossible for them to have the same value for f(x) since the function is strictly increasing or decreasing in any interval not containing e. From f(a) = f(b), and since a neq b and a > b > 0, it must be the case that one of them is greater than e while the other is less than e. This allows the conclusion that f(x) must have a local extremum at x = e which is a minimum. In this case, we know that at x= e the function f(x) = frac{e}{1} attains its minimum value.

Let’s consider the initial positions of the flies at the vertices of the cube. Assume there's a fly at each vertex A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H of the cube. 2. When all the flies move to a different vertex, we need to prove that there exists a set of three flies that form an equilateral triangle both in the initial and final positions. 3. Without loss of generality, we can assume one fly remains in its original position (say the fly at vertex A). 4. Consider the opposite vertex to A in the cube, which is G. If the fly originally at G stays at G, then any third fly, let's say the one initially at vertex B, will form the equilateral triangle ABG. 5. If the fly at G moves to another vertex, suppose X, we need to examine where the fly from X ends up. By nature of cube symmetry and rotation, moving flies between vertices will eventually form equilateral triangles. 6. For instance, if the fly from G moved to vertex D, and vertex G is now occupied by the fly from a different initial vertex (say vertex C), the triangles AGD and AGC remain equilateral given the properties and symmetry of the cube. 7. To elucidate, consider all possible movements of flies: - If a fly from vertex G moves to vertex D, and fly from D moves to vertex G, we get the triangles AGD and AGC by keeping track of fly positions. - Repeat for all other possible fly movements between vertices. 8. By symmetry, each vertex permutation will yield at least one set of three flies such that they form equilateral triangles in both initial and final configurations. # Conclusion: Thus, given the symmetry and rotational properties of a cube, there will always be three flies at vertices in the initial and final positions that form equilateral triangles.

That means for any integer ( a ), the elements must be colored using all four different colors distinctly. 3. **Mapping to integer lattice**: Define a new coloring of the integer lattice ( g: mathbb{Z} times mathbb{Z} rightarrow { R, G, B, Y } ) by the rule: [ g(i, j) = f(xi + yj) ] Here, the value ( xi + yj ) is colored according to the original coloring function ( f ). 4. **Property of lattice coloring**: According to our hypothesis, every unit square in ( g ) must have vertices colored by four different colors.

This means the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9, and the number itself must be even. 1. **Lowest Thousands Digit**: Start with the smallest even thousands digit, which is 2. 2. **Second Digit**: To keep the number minimal, choose the next smallest even hundreds digit, which is 0. 3. **Third and Fourth Digits**: The number must end in an even digit to be divisible by 2. The smallest such configuration using one odd digit and ensuring the sum of all digits is divisible by 9 is to have the tens digit as 7 (an odd number) and the unit digit as 8 (an even number). The digit sum then is (2 + 0 + 7 + 8 = 17), which is not divisible by 9. Adjusting for divisibility by 9, the next configuration would be to increase the odd digit to 9 (since increasing the even digits would make the number larger than necessary), making the digits (2, 0, 9, 6). The sum is (2 + 0 + 9 + 6 = 17), which is still not divisible by 9. Continue adjusting: - Change the unit digit to 4 (the next smallest even number after 6 that, combined with adjustments, might yield a sum divisible by 9), and the sum becomes (2 + 0 + 9 + 4 = 15). Still not divisible by 9. - Adjust to (2, 0, 5, 8); the sum is (2 + 0 + 5 + 8 = 15). Not divisible by 9. - Adjust to (2, 2, 1, 4); the sum is (2 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 9).

We need to prove that after the 8th round, there must exist a set of three teams among which none have played against each other. 2. **Selecting a Team:** Choose an arbitrary team, denoted as ( A ). There are 17 other teams besides ( A ). 3. **Number of Matches:** By the 8th round, team ( A ) has played 8 matches. This implies that there are 9 teams that have not played against ( A ) yet because there are 18 teams total and ( A ) has competed with 8 of them. Therefore: [ 17 - 8 = 9 quad text{teams that have not played against} A. ] 4. **Examining the 9 Teams:** Let’s denote this set of 9 teams that haven't played against ( A ) yet as ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_9 ). 5. **Case Analysis in Set of 9 Teams:** - **Case 1:** There are at least two teams among ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_9 ) that have not played against each other. - If such teams exist, let's say ( B_i ) and ( B_j ), then considering these teams with ( A ), the set ( { A, B_i, B_j } ) forms a set of three teams where no pair has played each other. - **Case 2:** Each team in ( { B_1, B_2, ldots, B_9 } ) has played with every other team. - In this situation, the 9 teams must form a complete subgraph, meaning every team must have played 8 matches against the other 8 teams in this group by the 8th round. 6. **Contradiction:** We reach a contradiction with Case 2: - Since we have an odd number of teams (9), not all matches can be internal to the 9-team group across 8 rounds. There would always be at least one team that couldn't have played all its matches within this group. - Thus, it is impossible for all 9 teams to have played every other team among them because at least one match for each team must be external to the group. 7. **Conclusion:** Since Case 2 leads to a contradiction, it must be that in the set ( { B_1, B_2, ldots, B_9 } ), there are at least two teams that have not played with each other. Hence, when combined with team ( A ), we find the desired set of three teams where none have played against each other.

From the similarity of triangles ( BCC' ) and ( AHC' ), given ( angle BCC' ) and ( angle AHC' ) are right angles, we obtain: [ frac{AH}{CB} = frac{AC'}{CC'} implies frac{AH}{a} = frac{AC'}{CC'} ] Thus, [ AH = a cdot frac{AC'}{CC'} ] In an acute triangle, considering triangle ( ACC' ), we have ( AC' = b cos A ) and ( CC' = b sin A ).

Therefore, the answer is boxed{(-infty, 0) cup (frac{1}{e}, +infty)}. First, take the derivative of f(x), f'(x) = a(1 - frac{2e}{x} + ln{x}), and let h(x) = 1 - frac{2e}{x} + ln{x} (x > 0). Analyze the monotonicity of h(x), and combine it with the parameter a to analyze the monotonicity of f(x).

We begin by focusing on one specific equality and proceed logically to establish the proofs for both. 1. Let's confirm the equality ( A O = A O_b ): - The triangle ( ABC ) is a right triangle. - The points ( O ) and ( O_b ) are the centers of the incircle and excircle opposite to vertex ( B ), respectively. 2. From geometry, we know the incenter ( O ) and excenter ( O_b ) have specific positioning: - ( O ) is the intersection point of the internal angle bisectors. - ( O_b ) is the intersection of the external angle bisector of ( angle A ) and the internal bisector of ( angle B ). 3. Considering the properties of angle bisectors and the symmetry induced in a right triangle: - The internal angle bisector and the external angle bisector of ( angle A ) are perpendicular. - The half-angle relationships are preserved at ( O ) and mirrored at ( O_b ). 4. By drawing the triangle and using the internal bisectors, observe: - ( O ) lies on the internal bisector of ( angle A ), and since ( angle A ) is right, ( O ) is in a symmetrical position relative to the triangle. - ( O_b ) is on the extended angle bisector of ( angle A ), forming again a symmetrical location. 5. Given that the poorly illustrated symmetry in the placement of ( O ) and ( O_b ): - Let us denote the lengths that measure the perpendicular drops from ( A ) to the respective circles. - Since these perpendiculars relate directly in a right triangle ( ABC ) due to the angle bisectors that denote equal division of angles. 6. Specifically focus on the angles formed at ( A ). - The angle ( Ahat{O}B ) would thus be ( 45^{circ} ) since ( Ahat{C}B ) together with both ( angle B ) and ( angle C ) sum to ( 135^{circ} ). From these arguments, the geometric symmetry and angle bisectors show ( A O = A O_b ): Conclusively resulting in: [ boxed{A O = A O_{b}} ] Next, we establish the second equality: 1. Similar arguments can be constructed for ( B O = B O_a ) implying the perpendicular symmetrical distances: - Here adopting the same principles of circle intersection symmetry where angle bisectors handle the conversions within the geometric framework, it holds identically true given the properties of angle bisectors which interplay perfectly in the definition of excenters and incircles.

Answer: 2.","completion":"1. **Identifying Constraints:** - We have five inhabitants on the island, each either a knight (always tells the truth) or a liar (always lies). - The statements provided by each inhabitant are as follows: 1. The first claims that there is one knight. 2. The second claims that there are two knights. 3. The third claims that there are three knights. 4. The fourth claims that the others are all liars. 5. The fifth calls the fourth a liar. 2. **Analyzing the Statements of the First Three Inhabitants:** - Since the first, second, and third inhabitants give different numbers for the count of knights, they cannot all be knights because each knight would have to tell the truth. - Therefore, at most one of them can be a knight. The rest must be liars. 3. **Analyzing the Statements of the Fourth and Fifth Inhabitants:** - The fourth says all the previous ones are liars, implying there are no knights among the first three. If the fourth is telling the truth (making the fourth a knight), this contradicts our earlier finding that one of the first three could be a knight. - Therefore, the fourth must be lying. This makes the fourth a liar. - The fifth calls the fourth a liar. Since the fourth is indeed a liar (confirmed in the previous step), the fifth must be telling the truth. 4. **Conclusion About the Number and Identities of Knights and Liars:** - Since the fifth is telling the truth, the fifth is a knight. - Considering earlier findings, out of the first three, one can be a knight and two must be liars. - The statement includes another that says there are two knights overall; hence, the second individual's claim of \\"two knights\\" must be true. - Therefore, the second and the fifth are knights. 5. **Verifying the Solution:** - If the second is a knight, their statement about there being two knights is true. - If the first is a liar, claiming there is one knight, this is false. - If the third is a liar, claiming there are three knights, this is false. - The fourth is a liar, as proven earlier. - The fifth is a knight, as verified. # Conclusion: Since the conditions are satisfied without contradictions, the number of knights on the island is indeed (boxed{2})."},{"prompt":"w many diagonals can be drawn for an octagon?","completion":"In any polygon, the number of diagonals can be calculated using the formula: [ text{number of diagonals} = frac{n(n-3)}{2} ] where ( n ) is the number of sides in the polygon.

Now, let's analyze the given equation: [ frac{1}{x+2}+frac{1}{1-y}=frac{1}{6} ] Multiplying both sides by 6(x+2)(1-y) to clear the denominators, we get: [ 6(1-y)+6(x+2)=6(x+2)(1-y) ] Expanding and simplifying, we find: [ 6x+12+6-6y=6x-6xy+12-12y ] This simplifies to: [ 18-6y=6x-6xy+12-12y ] Rearranging terms, we aim to find a relationship that can help us minimize x-y.

By symmetry, each side of the decagon creates a triangle with the center, and each of these triangles is congruent. The midpoint segments and other connections will subdivide these triangles.

Let's denote the weight he claims to give to the customer as W_c and the actual weight he gives as W_a. We know that W_c = W_a + x% of W_a. The trader's profit is 43%.

The Baron boasts that he managed to visit all the residential rooms, visiting each only once, and return to the starting point (each wall between two adjacent residential rooms has a door). Could the Baron's words be true? end{quote} 1. **Understanding the Division and Layout**: - Initially, the castle is divided into 9 square halls, with the central hall holding the arsenal. - The remaining 8 halls are each divided into 9 smaller square halls, with the central ones being winter gardens. - Each of these 64 remaining halls is further divided into 9 square rooms, with the central rooms being swimming pools, and the rest are residential rooms. So, we know: [ 1 text{ initial central hall} + 8 times 8 = 64 text{ winter garden halls} ] [ 1 text{ initial central room} + 8 times 8 (text{central rooms in 8 winter garden halls}) = 64 text{ swimming pool rooms} ] 2. **Total Number of Residential Rooms**: To find the total number of residential rooms: [ 9 times 8 = 72 text{ total rooms in the remaining 8 halls} ] Each of these rooms is subdivided into 9 rooms: [ 72 times 8 text{ (excluding the central room)} = 576 text{ residential rooms} ] 3. **Constructing the Eulerian Path**: To determine the possibility of the Baron's claim, we need to verify if there is an Eulerian path in the constructed graph where the rooms are nodes and the doors are edges. An Eulerian path exists in an undirected graph if exactly 0 or 2 vertices have an odd degree and all vertices with nonzero degree are connected. 4. **Checking Each Room's Degree**: In our castle, since each residential room is connected to its neighboring rooms by doors, and we need to verify that all rooms and doors allow a continuous path covering all rooms once: - Each room (except those on the boundary of the hall or castle itself) will be connected to 4 other rooms (north, east, south, west). - Boundary rooms will have fewer connections but still allow partitions with even degrees or have thoroughly connected structures if considering castle layout. 5. **Evaluation**: By our continuous traversal without lifting and overlapping (depicted with changing edge direction or mirrored for adjacent neighbor switches), we can trace: - Hall by hall considering full coverage maintaining connectivity, adjusting for central isolated paths. Hence reasoning follows the Eulerian path verification: # Conclusion: The Baron's words could indeed be true, given a constructed Eulerian path allowing each residential room to be visited exactly once without retracing steps, reconnecting to the initial starting point.

Since the paper is 5 cm wide, each new circle formed by wrapping the paper once around the tube will have a diameter 5 cm greater than the previous one. 3. **Arithmetic Series of Diameters:** The sequence of diameters forms an arithmetic series where: - The first term (a = 2) cm (diameter of the innermost circle). - The common difference (d = 5) cm (increase per wrap). - The number of terms (n = 600) (number of wraps).

Substitute n - i = a_i m_i^l back into the main equation C_n^k: [ left( prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i right) left( prod_{i=0}^{k-1} m_i right)^l = k! m^l ] 9.

We aim to show v = 1. If v neq 1, there exists a prime factor p_0 dividing v, therefore, p_0 leq k. Considering how many times p_0 divides prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i: [ left( sum_{i=1}^{l-1} left( leftlfloor frac{k}{p_0^i} rightrfloor + 1 right) - sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{k}{p_0^i} rightrfloor right) leq l-1 ] This contradiction means v = 1, so indeed, left( prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a_i right) mid k!. 11. For k geq 4 and using {a_0, a_1, dots, a_{k-1}} = {1, 2, dots, k}, we choose i_1, i_2, i_3 such that a_{i_1} = 2, a_{i_2} = 2, a_{i_3} = 4. We need to show that left( n - i_2 right)^2 neq left( n - i_1 right) left( n - i_3 right). 12. Assume left( n - i_2 right)^2 = left( n - i_1 right) left( n - i_3 right): [ b = n - i_2 quad x = b - left( n - i_1 right) quad y = -b + left( n - i_3 right) ] Because 0 < |x| < |y| < k, given (b - x)(b + y) = b^2: [ b x neq b y ] Contradiction reveals left(n - i_2 right)^2 neq left(n - i_1 right) left(n - i_3 right), thus m_{i_2}^2 neq m_{i_1} m_{i_3}. 13. Contrasting a step back if m_{i_2}^2 neq m_{i_1} m_{i_3} leads: [ 2(k-1) n > n^2 - (n - k + 1)^2 > left(n - i_2 right)^2 - left(n - i_1 right) left(n - i_3 right) ] Further legitimation proves: [ k n^{2/3} geq k m_{i_1} m_{i_3} > n quad k > n^{1/3} ] and n > k^2 if n and k exist, another contradiction! 14.

Which one?","completion":"Given four statements about the divisibility of a number ( a ): 1. ( a ) is divisible by 2. 2. ( a ) is divisible by 4. 3. ( a ) is divisible by 12. 4. ( a ) is divisible by 24. We are told that three of these statements are true, and one is false. We need to figure out which statement is the false one. 1. **Statement Analysis:** - If ( a ) is divisible by 24, then ( a ) must be divisible by ( 2 times 12 = 24 ). - If ( a ) is divisible by 24, then ( a ) must also be divisible by all factors of 24. These factors include ( 2 ), ( 4 ), and ( 12 ). 2. **Checking Each Statement:** - If ( a ) is divisible by ( 24 ), then ( a ) is certainly divisible by ( 2 ) (since 24 is divisible by 2). - If ( a ) is divisible by ( 24 ), then ( a ) is certainly divisible by ( 4 ) (since 24 is divisible by 4). - If ( a ) is divisible by ( 24 ), then ( a ) is certainly divisible by ( 12 ) (since 24 is divisible by 12). 3. **Logical Deduction:** - If the statement \\"a is divisible by 24\\" was true, then all previous statements regarding divisibility by 2, 4, and 12 must also be true. - But since we are given that there is exactly one false statement, the statement \\"a is divisible by 24\\" cannot be true without causing all previous statements to be true simultaneously.

Since there are 5 major characters, the total amount paid to all major characters per episode is 5 * 3M, which is 15M. The total amount paid to all characters per episode is the sum of the amounts paid to the minor and major characters, which is 4M + 15M, or 19M.

Step 1: Define the base case We start with a fixed placement on a 9 times 18 grid. Each \\"domino\\" or \\"triomino\\" (let's call them textit{tiles}) will be placed to cover the entire grid. Step 2: Understanding the arrangement of 2 times 5 tiles The problem states that a 2 times 5 rectangular tile can be placed either horizontally or vertically and then one grid is removed from one of its corners, leaving 9 remaining grids out of each 10. The resulting leftover 9 grid shape is referred to as either textit{five-four flag} or textit{eight-one flag}. Step 3: Calculate available spaces for 2 times 5 tiles We need to figure out how many distinct placements there are for such tiles on a 9 times 18 board: - There are 9 times 18 = 162 total grids. - Each 2 times 5 tile covers 9 grids after removing 1 (corner grid). - The maximum possible unique placements is frac{162}{9} = 18 tiles. Since each tile must be placed without overlapping, this calculation helps us to understand the total number of non-overlapping tiles required to cover the entire board without leaving any space. Step 4: Identifying the constraints due to corner grid removal Each tile requires removal of 1 corner grid, creating a challenge as: - Obtaining symmetric placements without leaving unfillable gaps is crucial. - Both horizontal and vertical placements might need to be used based on the initial configuration constraints and remaining empty grids next to the current tile. Step 5: Ensuring non-overlapping full coverage Each tile's position is crucial to ensure complete coverage without gaps. Consideration of each possible tile placement, rotation, and reflection leads to various configurations. Step 6: Calculate the distinct configurations - Configurations undergo strict check to find non-overlapping tiles and valid rotation/combinations. - Each grid covered by a tile removed from the total possible combinations repeatedly ensures no missing grid is left for overlap or uncovered. Let’s break the configurations further by leveraging symmetry and rotational combination: 1. Initial tile placement generates subsequent valid placement zones. 2. Utilizing rotational 90-degree angles for the second layer if the first layer covers 5 at horizontal/equivalent vertical remaining 4 grids coverage completion. Given the consideration for each tile’s unique coverage area and symmetry during replacement: [boxed{2^{(9 times 18/9)}=2^{18}}] This complex breakdown ensures each distinct tile configuration over sufficient placements and rotations guarantees valid non-repeatative and ensures complete un-gapped, non-overlapping coverage for a total of boxed{262144} unique placements."},{"prompt":"The average monthly salary of 20 employees in an organisation is Rs. 1500.

For the line y=-x+1, the slope is -1. This means the line is declining as we move to the right. The angle of inclination is 135° because it starts at 90° for a vertical line and increases by 45°, which is the corresponding angle for a slope of -1. For the line y=x+1, the slope is 1. This means the line is rising as we move to the right, with an angle of inclination of 45° relative to the positive x-axis. For the line y=2x+1, the slope is 2.

For each such pair, either O lies above or below the line segment EF. - If O lies above EF, then for any point X in B, the triangle triangle EFX contains O. - If O lies below EF, then for any point Y in D, the triangle triangle EFY contains O. - Since there are n^2 pairs of points (E, F) with E in A and F in C, and for each pair, there are n points in B or D such that the corresponding triangle contains O, we have at least n^3 triangles containing O with two vertices in A and C. - Similarly, for pairs of points (E, F) with E in B and F in D, we have at least n^3 triangles containing O. 4. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the total number of triangles containing O is at least 2n^3.

Therefore, the combined probability of B and C (choosing two males or two females) is the complement of event A. Calculating the probabilities, we find: - The probability of event A (choosing one male and one female) is frac{2}{4} times frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{4} times frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{2} (since after picking one student of a particular gender, only one remains for the next pick, and since the order of selection doesn't matter, we multiply by 2). - The probability of event B (choosing two males) is frac{2}{4} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6}. - The probability of event C (choosing two females) is also frac{2}{4} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6}.

We know n < 150 and n = 9k - 1 = 5m - 2 for some integers k and m. From n = 9k - 1, we solve for n + 1 = 9k. From n = 5m - 2, we solve for n + 2 = 5m. Therefore, 9k = 5m - 1. This implies 9k + 1 = 5m. Now, 9k + 1 = 5m needs to be solved. Starting by isolating m, m = frac{9k + 1}{5}. For m to be an integer, 9k + 1 must be divisible by 5. Examining this modulo 5, we get 9k + 1 equiv 0 pmod{5}, which simplifies to 4k equiv -1 equiv 4 pmod{5}, or k equiv 1 pmod{5}. Let's find suitable k such that n is maximum but less than 150.

During this period, he took 27 steps before the car disappeared behind the corner, and continued walking 135 more steps to reach the corner. 4.

Define new sequences (c_{n}) and (d_{n}) by (c_{n} = a_{n} + 1) and (d_{n} = b_{n} + 1). Therefore, we have: [ begin{aligned} c_{n+1} &= a_{n+1} + 1 = frac{a_{n} b_{n} + a_{n} + b_{n} + 1}{b_{n}}, &= frac{c_{n} cdot d_{n} - c_{n} - d_{n} + 2 + a_{n} + b_{n}}{b_{n}}, &= frac{c_{n} cdot d_{n}}{d_{n} - 1}, [10pt] d_{n+1} &= b_{n+1} + 1 = frac{a_{n} b_{n} + a_{n} + b_{n} + 1}{a_{n}}, &= frac{c_{n} cdot d_{n}}{c_{n} - 1}. end{aligned} ] 4. Next, we consider sequences (e_{n}) and (f_{n}) defined by (e_{n} = frac{1}{c_{n}}) and (f_{n} = frac{1}{d_{n}}). We then have: [ begin{aligned} e_{n+1} &= frac{1}{c_{n+1}} = frac{1}{c_{n} cdot frac{d_{n}}{d_{n} - 1}} = e_{n} left(1 - f_{n}right), [10pt] f_{n+1} &= frac{1}{d_{n+1}} = frac{1}{d_{n} cdot frac{c_{n}}{c_{n} - 1}} = f_{n} left(1 - e_{n}right). end{aligned} ] 5. To analyze the behavior of these sequences, we consider the difference (e_{n+1} - f_{n+1}): [ e_{n+1} - f_{n+1} = e_{n} left(1 - f_{n}right) - f_{n} left(1 - e_{n}right). ] Simplifying this, we get: [ e_{n+1} - f_{n+1} = e_{n} - e_{n} f_{n} - f_{n} + e_{n} f_{n} = e_{n} - f_{n}. ] 6. By induction for all (n geqslant 0): [ e_{n} - f_{n} = e_{0} - f_{0}. ] Initially: [ e_{0} = frac{1}{c_{0}} = frac{1}{2}, quad f_{0} = frac{1}{d_{0}} = frac{1}{3}. ] Thus: [ e_{0} - f_{0} = frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6}. ] 7. So, for all (n geqslant 0), the difference (e_{n} - f_{n} = frac{1}{6}). Since both (e_{n}) and (f_{n}) are positive, we must have (e_{n} geqslant frac{1}{6}). Hence: [ c_{n} leqslant 6. ] 8.

Since the probabilities must sum to 1, i.e., ( p_1 + p_2 + ldots + p_n = 1 ), the equality condition of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality ( (p_1p_2 + p_2p_3 + ldots + p_np_1)^2 leq (p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ldots + p_n^2) ) is only achieved if ( p_i = k p_{i+1}, p_{i+1} = k p_{i+2}, ldots, p_n = k p_1 ) for some constant ( k ). 7. However, ( p_1 + p_2 + ldots + p_n = 1 ) but ( k p_1 + k p_2 + ldots + k p_1 = 1k ), which implies ( k = 1 ) (impossible for non-equal probabilities under our assumption). 8. This non-equal probability distribution implies: [ p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 + ldots + p_n^2 > p_1p_2 + p_2p_3 + ldots + p_{n-1}p_n + p_np_1 ] 9.

Therefore, the correct negation of p is: neg p: exists x geqslant 0, 2^{x} neq 3. This matches option D, which states neg p: exists x geqslant 0, 2^{x} neq 3.

To find the cost of five CDs, we calculate the cost per CD and then multiply by five.

Compare this with the modified equation: f(x) + f(-y) = 2 fleft(frac{x - y}{2}right) fleft(frac{x + y}{2}right). 4. **Concluding that ( f(y) = f(-y) ):** Since the right-hand sides of both equations are equal, it must be true that: f(x) + f(y) = f(x) + f(-y). Simplifying this, we remove ( f(x) ) from both sides: f(y) = f(-y). This shows that ( f(y) ) is equal to ( f(-y) ) for all ( y ). 5. **Conclusion:** Since ( f(y) = f(-y) ) for all real ( y ), this implies that the function ( f(x) ) is even by definition. boxed{text{True}}"},{"prompt":"Andy starts solving problems in a math exercise.

Approach using heights: 1. Consider the isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( AB = BC ). Draw the altitude ( BH ) which is also the median to ( AC ) (since ( triangle ABC ) is isosceles). 2. Note that ( BH ) bisects ( angle BAC ) and ( AC ), thus ( H ) is the midpoint of ( AC ). 3. Given: [ AM = 7, quad MB = 3, quad angle BMC = 60^circ ] 4.

Solving these equations yields a^2 = 8, b^2 = 4, thus the equation of the desired ellipse is: dfrac{x^2}{8} + dfrac{y^2}{4} = 1. (2) Proof: Given that M and N are two non-vertex points on the ellipse C, and AP parallel OM, BP parallel ON, let P(2sqrt{2}cos theta, 2sin theta). Then the slopes of lines AP and BP must exist and are not 0, and it is known that k_{AP}k_{BP} = dfrac{2sin theta}{2sqrt{2}cos theta + 2sqrt{2}} cdot dfrac{2sin theta}{2sqrt{2}cos theta - 2sqrt{2}} = dfrac{4sin^2theta}{8(cos^2theta -1)} = -dfrac{1}{2}.

Next, we need to determine how much over the speed limit Mark was going. He was driving at 75 mph in a 30 mph zone, so he was 75 - 30 = 45 mph over the speed limit. The fine increases by 2 for every mile per hour over the speed limit, so the additional penalty for speeding is 45 mph * 2/mph = 90. Adding this to the base fine, we get 50 + 90 = 140. Since Mark was in a school zone, the fine is doubled: 140 * 2 = 280. Now, we add the court costs, which are 300: 280 + 300 = 580. Mark owes a total of 820, and we've accounted for 580 so far. The remaining amount is for his lawyer's fees: 820 - 580 = 240.

To determine if we can place the numbers 1, 2, ldots, 12 on the edges of a cube such that the product of the four numbers on the top face is equal to the product of the four numbers on the bottom face, we need to assign the numbers strategically. 2. Consider placing the numbers 2, 4, 9, and 10 on the top face of the cube. 3. For the bottom face, we place the numbers 3, 5, 6, and 8. 4. The remaining numbers 1, 7, 11, and 12 are assigned to the side edges. Next, let's verify the products: 5. The product of the numbers on the top face is: [ 2 times 4 times 9 times 10 = 2 times 4 times 9 times 10 = 2 times 4 = 8, quad 8 times 9 = 72, quad 72 times 10 = 720 ] 6.

Let's check the condition for an odd function: f(-x) + 8 = a(-x)^4+b(-x)^2+2(-x) + 8 = ax^4+bx^2-2x + 8. 2.

Therefore, our assumption that f(x) + 8 is an odd function is incorrect. 3. However, using the information given, we can find f(1) directly. Since f(-1) = 10, we have: a(-1)^4 + b(-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 8 = 10 implies a + b - 2 - 8 = 10. 4. Simplifying the equation: a + b = 10 + 2 + 8, a + b = 20. 5.

According to the Angle Bisector Theorem, ( AM ) will divide the side ( BC ) into two segments, ( BM ) and ( MC ). 2. **Draw perpendiculars from ( B ) and ( C ) to ( AM ):** Let's drop perpendiculars from ( B ) and ( C ) to the angle bisector ( AM ). Let these perpendiculars intersect ( AM ) at points ( K ) and ( L ) respectively. 3. **Consider triangles ( triangle ABK ) and ( triangle ACL ):** Triangles ( triangle ABK ) and ( triangle ACL ) are similar because: - They both have a right angle at ( K ) and ( L ). - They share the angle ( angle BAM ) and ( angle CAM ). By similarity, the corresponding sides of these triangles are proportional. Therefore, we have the following proportional relationship: [ frac{BK}{CL} = frac{AB}{AC} ] 4. **Consider triangles ( triangle KBM ) and ( triangle LCM ):** Similarly, triangles ( triangle KBM ) and ( triangle LCM ) are similar because: - They are right triangles sharing a corresponding angle at ( M ). - They have the same angle ( angle BKM ) and ( angle LCM ). Hence, the proportional relationship between their corresponding sides is: [ frac{BK}{CL} = frac{BM}{MC} ] 5. **Combine the proportions:** From the similarity of the triangles ( triangle ABK ) and ( triangle ACL ), we have ( frac{BK}{CL} = frac{AB}{AC} ). From the similarity of the triangles ( triangle KBM ) and ( triangle LCM ), we have ( frac{BK}{CL} = frac{BM}{MC} ).

The circles intersect in pairs at points A, B, and C such that: - omega_A and omega_B intersect at A, - omega_B and omega_C intersect at B, - omega_C and omega_A intersect at C. 2. **Perform an inversion around M:** Perform an inversion around point M with radius r. Under this inversion, the circles omega_A, omega_B, and omega_C are transformed into three lines because they all pass through the center of inversion M. 3. **Inverted points and properties:** Let A', B', and C' be the images of points A, B, and C under the inversion. Since the circles are equal and intersect at M, the distances from M to the images of the circles' centers are equal. Therefore, M is the incenter of the inverted triangle A'B'C'. 4. **Intersection points and angle bisectors:** Let J_A = AM cap BC, J_B = BM cap AC, and J_C = CM cap AB. Under inversion, these points map to J'_A = A'M cap (MB'C'), J'_B = B'M cap (MC'A'), and J'_C = C'M cap (MA'B') respectively. 5. **Cyclic quadrilaterals and excenters:** Since A'M, B'M, and C'M are angle bisectors in the inverted triangle A'B'C', and (B'MC'J'_A) is cyclic, J'_A is the A'-excenter of triangle A'B'C'. This implies that angle J'_AB'M = 90^circ. 6. **Orthocenter property:** Since angle J'_AB'M = 90^circ, it follows that angle AJ_AB = 90^circ.

For example, if (p) is odd and (q) is even, then (pqr-1) is odd since the product of an odd and two even numbers is even, and subtracting 1 results in an odd number. On the other hand, ((p-1)(q-1)(r-1)) would be even because (p-1), (q-1), and (r-1) would mix odd and even numbers, leading to an even product. Thus, the division is impossible without parity matching. - Therefore, (p, q, r) must be either all odd or all even. 3. **Bounding (p):** - If (p geq 4), then examining (F(p, q, r)leq F(4,6,8)): [ F(4, 6, 8) = frac{4 times 6 times 8 - 1}{(4-1)(6-1)(8-1)} = frac{191}{105} < 2. ] Since (1 < F(p, q, r) < 2) is impossible, we conclude (p leq 3). 4. **Case (p = 2):** - When (p = 2), (q, r) must be even integer values greater than 2. - Calculating (F(2, q, r)leq F(2, 4, 6)): [ F(2, 4, 6) = frac{2 times 4 times 6 - 1}{(2-1)(4-1)(6-1)} = frac{47}{15} < 4. ] Therefore, consider (F(2, q, r) in {2, 3 }).

Each performance is labeled as ( P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{n} ).

However, since the problem specifically states that there is an extremum, and the first derivative test confirms a=3, it meets the necessary condition for x=1 to be an extremum.

Since the electric pole can be considered as a point in comparison to the length of the train, the time it takes for the train to cross the pole is the time it takes for the entire length of the train to pass by the pole. The length of the train is 100 meters, and the speed is 35 m/s, so the time (t) it takes to cross the pole is given by the formula: t = distance / speed t = 100 meters / 35 m/s t ≈ 2.857 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{2.857} seconds for the train to cross the electric pole."},{"prompt":"Rachelle uses 3 pounds of meat to make 8 hamburgers for her family.

Therefore, for f(x) to have a local minimum less than 0, we must have m < 0. 4. **Analysis of f'(x) for m < 0**: - For m < 0, we examine the sign of f'(x): - When x > -m, f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing. - When 0 < x < -m, f'(x) < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing. - This suggests that at x = -m, f(x) reaches a local minimum. 5. **Value of f(x) at x = -m**: To ensure this local minimum is less than 0, we calculate f(-m): [ f(-m) = ln(-m) - frac{m}{-m} = ln(-m) + 1. ] For f(-m) < 0, we need ln(-m) + 1 < 0. 6. **Solving Inequality for m**: - Solving ln(-m) + 1 < 0 leads to the inequality m > -frac{1}{e}, where e is the base of the natural logarithm. - Combining this with m < 0, we find the range for m to be -frac{1}{e} < m < 0.

The number of tourists visiting Lingshan Temple has been increasing rapidly year by year.

Observing the data, from 2020 to 2021, the number of tourists increased by 6,000 (from 12,000 to 18,000), and from 2021 to 2022, it increased by 9,000 (from 18,000 to 27,000). This indicates an increasing growth rate, which aligns with the characteristics of an exponential growth model rather than a linear growth in the square root of x. Hence, the exponential model y=ka^{x} is more appropriate. To find the analytical expression of the chosen function model, we use the given data points (1,12) and (2,18) in the function y=ka^{x}. This results in a system of equations: 1. For x=1, y=12: ka^{1} = 12 2. For x=2, y=18: ka^{2} = 18 From the first equation, we have the relation ka = 12. Substituting this into the second equation yields: ka^2 = 18 12a = 18 a = frac{18}{12} = frac{3}{2} With a = frac{3}{2}, we can substitute back to find k: ka = 12 kleft(frac{3}{2}right) = 12 k = 12 div left(frac{3}{2}right) = 8 Therefore, the analytical expression of the function model is y = 8left(frac{3}{2}right)^x, where x in mathbb{N}^{*}.

We can set up the following equations: 1) 3x + 4y = 200 (total sales) 2) y >= 20 (fewest number of 4 frisbees) We want to find the minimum value of y that satisfies both equations. Since we are given that y is at least 20, let's start by assuming y = 20 and see if we can find a corresponding value for x that satisfies equation 1.

Since each strip is effectively ( 2 times 5 = 10 ) units wide (two sides of 5), the total area contributed by the strips is: [ 5 times (a + b + c) = 5p ] 3. **Circular Sectors at the Vertices:** - At each vertex of the triangle, two of the rectangular strips meet at a right angle, forming a quarter-circle sector of radius 5 to smoothly connect the strips. - Each sector has an area of: [ text{Area of a quarter-circle} = frac{1}{4} pi times (5)^2 = frac{25pi}{4} ] - Since there are three vertices, these sectors together form three quarter-circles, which is equivalent to a full circle of radius 5. - Hence, the total area contributed by the sectors is: [ 3 times frac{25pi}{4} = 25pi ] Summing up all the areas, we get the total area ( S ): [ text{Total Area } = A + (5p) + (25pi) ] # Conclusion: The area of the set ( S ) is given by: [ boxed{A + 5p + 25pi} ]"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},N=["disabled"],z={key:0},I={key:1};function L(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",W,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
