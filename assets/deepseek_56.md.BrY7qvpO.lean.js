The increase in the sum due to this rounding is calculated by considering how much each number is increased to reach 10: 10 - 5 = 5, 10 - 6 = 4, 10 - 7 = 3, 10 - 8 = 2, 10 - 9 = 1, and 10 - 10 = 0. Adding these differences gives us 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 15. 2. **Calculating the Net Change for Each Group of Ten Numbers:** The net change in Kate's sum for each group of ten numbers, compared to Jo's sum, is the sum of the decrease and the increase: -10 + 15 = 5. 3. **Applying the Logic to All Groups of Ten Numbers from 1 to 50:** Since the numbers 1 to 50 can be divided into five groups of ten numbers (i.e., 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50), and each group contributes a net change of 5 to Kate's sum compared to Jo's sum, we multiply this net change by the number of groups: 5 times 5 = 25. 4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the positive difference between Jo's sum and Kate's sum is boxed{25}."},{"prompt":"Calculate: 1+i^2+i^3+ldots+i^{10} (where i represents the imaginary unit).","completion":"We have i+i^2+i^3+ldots+i^{10} = (i+i^2+i^3+i^4)+(i^5+i^6+i^7+i^8)+i^9+i^{10}.

For the first route: - He walks uphill for 6 minutes. - He walks along a path for twice the time he walked uphill, which is 2 * 6 = 12 minutes. - He finishes the journey in a third of the time it took to walk the first two stages, so we add the times of the first two stages (6 + 12 = 18 minutes) and divide by 3 to get the time for the final stage, which is 18 / 3 = 6 minutes. The total time for the first route is the sum of the three stages: 6 + 12 + 6 = 24 minutes. For the second route: - He walks along a flat path for 14 minutes. - He finishes the walk in twice this amount of time, which is 2 * 14 = 28 minutes. The total time for the second route is the sum of the two stages: 14 + 28 = 42 minutes.

Since 2/3 of the men are single, this means that 1/3 of the men are married. The number of men in the company is 100 - 58 = 42 men. 1/3 of the 42 men are married, which is 42/3 = 14 married men. Since there are 60 married employees in total and 14 of them are men, the number of married women is 60 - 14 = 46 women. Now, we need to find the fraction of the women who are married. There are 58 women in total, and 46 of them are married. The fraction of women who are married is 46/58.

These are the steps to determine the correct condition on ( k ). **Step 1: Analyze the second equation** The equation ( 9x^2 + 25y^2 = 225 ) represents an ellipse. First, convert it to the standard form of an ellipse equation. [ frac{9x^2}{225} + frac{25y^2}{225} = 1 implies frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1 ] We know that the standard equation of an ellipse is ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ).

For a hyperbola ( frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ), the focal distance ( 2c ) is given by ( c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). In this equation: [ a^2 = 16 - k quad text{and} quad b^2 = k ] Then, [ c = sqrt{(16 - k) + k} = sqrt{16} = 4 ] Thus, the focal distance is: [ 2c = 2 times 4 = 8 ] **Step 3: Condition on ( k )** For the focal distances to be equal: [ 2c = 8 quad text{(must be true for both the ellipse and the hyperbola)} ] For the equation (frac{x^{2}}{16-k} - frac{y^{2}}{k} = 1), it's evident ( k neq 0 ), as this would make the denominator of ( frac{y^{2}}{k} ) zero, which is not valid. Furthermore: - If ( k < 0 ), the term ( 16 - k ) becomes greater than 16, so the constant term under the radical is always positive. - If ( 0 < k < 16 ), the hyperbola condition is still valid.

The total amount of money that Isabella, Sam, and Giselle have together is: S (Sam's money) + (S + 45) (Isabella's money) + (S + 30) (Giselle's money). This sum is then donated to three shoppers who share it equally, and each shopper receives 115. Therefore, the total amount donated is 3 shoppers * 115 per shopper = 345. So we have the equation: S + (S + 45) + (S + 30) = 345. Combining like terms, we get: 3S + 75 = 345. Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get: 3S = 345 - 75, 3S = 270. Dividing both sides by 3, we get: S = 270 / 3, S = 90. Now that we know Sam has 90, we can find out how much Giselle has by adding 30 to Sam's amount (since Giselle has 30 more than Sam): Giselle's money = S + 30, Giselle's money = 90 + 30, Giselle's money = 120.

We aim to show that ( P ) has the smallest sum of distances to the vertices of the tetrahedron if and only if ( P ) is at the center of the tetrahedron. 1. **Initial Setup**: Define ( A, B, C, D ) as the vertices of the regular tetrahedron and ( P ) as a general point in space. 2. **Projection and Perpendicularity**: Let ( X ) be the midpoint of the edge ( CD ). Assume that ( P' ) is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from ( P ) to the plane ( ABX ) (formed by vertices ( A, B, X )). Our goal is to compare the sums of distances ( PA + PB + PC + PD ) and ( P'A + P'B + P'C + P'D ). 3. **Inequalities from Projection**: - Since ( P' ) is the orthogonal projection of ( P ) on the plane ( ABX ), we have: [ PA > P'A quad text{and} quad PB > P'B ] because the distances from ( P ) to ( A ) and ( B ) are minimized when ( P ) is projected onto the plane containing ( A ) and ( B ). 4. **Reflecting and Isosceles Triangle**: - Inspect the distances ( PC ) and ( PD ). Since ( P' ) is on the plane ( ABX ), and ( P ) is the same perpendicular distance from the line ( CD ) as ( P' ) but not directly on the plane: [ PC + PD > P'C + P'D ] due to the fact that ( P' ) forms an isosceles configuration (in terms of reflections). - The easiest way to see this involves reflecting points ( C ) and ( D ) across the line ( PP' ) to create points ( C' ) and ( D' ). Consequently: [ PC = PC' quad text{and} quad PC' + PD > C'D ] - Since reflection maintains the distances, we have: [ PC + PD = PC' + PD > C'D = P'C + P'D ] 5. **Resultant Inequality**: Combining these inequalities: [ PA + PB + PC + PD > P'A + P'B + P'C + P'D ] Hence, if ( PA + PB + PC + PD ) is minimized, then ( P ) must lie on the plane ( ABX ). 6. **Intersection of Planes**: By similar reasoning as above, ( P ) must also lie in the plane formed by ( CDY ) where ( Y ) is the midpoint of ( AB ). Thus, ( P ) must lie on the line ( XY ), which connects the midpoints of opposite edges. 7. **Center of Tetrahedron**: By analyzing the geometry of the tetrahedron, we find that ( P ) must also lie on lines connecting other pairs of midpoints. These lines intersect at the centroid (or geometric center) of the tetrahedron. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the point ( P ) in space has the smallest sum of distances to the vertices of the tetrahedron if and only if it is the center of the tetrahedron.

Let's break down each calculation step by step. # Calculation of Probabilities 1. **Probability of A (both balls are of the same color):** - There are two ways to draw two balls of the same color: both red or both white. - The probability of drawing both red balls is frac{2}{4} times frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{12}. - The probability of drawing both white balls is also frac{2}{4} times frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{12}. - Therefore, P(A) = frac{2}{12} + frac{2}{12} = frac{4}{12} = frac{1}{3}. 2. **Probability of B (the first ball is red):** - There are 2 red balls and 4 balls in total, so P(B) = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2}. 3. **Probability of D (the two balls are of different colors):** - There are two ways to draw balls of different colors: first red then white, or first white then red. - The probability for each scenario is frac{2}{4} times frac{2}{3} = frac{4}{12}. - Therefore, P(D) = frac{4}{12} + frac{4}{12} = frac{8}{12} = frac{2}{3}. # Calculation of Combined Probabilities 4. **Probability of AB (both balls are of the same color and the first ball is red):** - This can only happen if both drawn balls are red. - The probability is frac{2}{4} times frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{12} = frac{1}{6}. 5. **Probability of BD (the first ball is red and the two balls are of different colors):** - This scenario is not possible because if the first ball is red, and both balls are of different colors, it contradicts the condition of A. - However, for calculation, considering the approach, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the explanation. The correct interpretation should focus on the independence calculation rather than the scenario feasibility. Let's correct this: - The probability of drawing a red ball first and then a ball of a different color (which would actually fall under event D) is not directly calculated here. Instead, we should focus on the independence verification through P(BD) = P(B) cdot P(D). # Verification of Statements - **A and B are mutually independent:** - We check this by verifying if P(AB) = P(A) cdot P(B). - P(AB) = frac{1}{6} and P(A) cdot P(B) = frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{6}. - Since these are equal, A and B are mutually independent. - **B and D are mutually independent:** - We check this by verifying if P(BD) = P(B) cdot P(D). - Given the misunderstanding in the explanation for P(BD), we correct our approach by focusing on the independence condition. - Since P(BD) = P(B) cdot P(D) as per the initial solution, they are considered independent based on the calculation provided. - **A and D are complementary:** - Events A and D cover all possible outcomes (either the balls are of the same color or of different colors), so they are complementary. - **B and C are mutually exclusive:** - This statement is incorrect because it's possible for the first and second balls to be red simultaneously, which does not make them mutually exclusive. # Conclusion The correct choices, based on the detailed analysis, are A, B, and D.

This is because the tangents from a point outside a circle (here P) to the circle form a harmonic bundle with any two points on the circle and their intersection on the circle. In this case, PB and PD are tangents, and B and D are points on the circle, making ABCD a harmonic quadrilateral. 5. **Symmedian and Median**: In a harmonic quadrilateral, the diagonal (here overline{BD}) is a symmedian of the triangle formed by the other two vertices and the point of intersection of the diagonals (here triangle ABC). Since angle ABD = angle CBE and AD = EC, overline{BD}, which is a symmedian, also behaves as the median of triangle ABC. 6. **Conclusion**: Since overline{BD} is a median of triangle ABC and overline{BE} is part of overline{BD}, it follows that overline{BE} bisects overline{AC}. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let ( ABCD ) be a chordal quadrilateral with a circumcenter ( O ) such that the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) are perpendicular to each other.

Because (g) is the reflection of diagonal (AC), the angle (angle A'AX = beta). 4. **Find Specific Angles**: Since (angle XAD = angle XAC + angle CAD = alpha + beta), it follows that (angle BAX = alpha + beta). Therefore, [ angle BAA' = angle BAX - angle A'AX = (alpha + beta) - beta = alpha. ] 5. **Determine the Angle for Reflection**: Similarly, [ angle A'AC = angle A'AX + angle XAC = beta + beta = 2beta. ] 6. **Apply Peripherally Angle Theorem**: Since (ABAD) is a chordal quadrilateral, by the periphery angle theorem, [ alpha + 2beta = angle CAD + angle A'AC = angle A'AD = angle A'BD = alpha + 2beta. ] 7. **Evaluate the Angles in Quadrilateral**: Thus, [ angle DBA = 180^circ - 90^circ - angle BAC = 90^circ - (alpha + 2beta). ] 8. **Construct Final Argument**: Adding up the angles we get: [ angle A'BA = angle A'BD + angle DBA = (alpha + 2beta) + (90^circ - alpha - 2beta) = 90^circ. ] Hence, (angle A'BA = 90^circ) which implies that (AA') is a diameter. 9. **Conclusion**: Thus, since (AA') as a diameter passes through the circumcenter (O), we conclude that (O) lies on line (g).

Hence, we arrive at the inequality: [ na leq [nx] leq na + n - 1 ] By applying this result to each term in our given equation, we get: [ [x] + [2x] + [4x] + [8x] + [16x] + [32x] ] Replacing each term using our derived inequalities, we have: [ a + [2(a + f)] + [4(a + f)] + [8(a + f)] + [16(a + f)] + [32(a + f)] ] This simplifies to: [ a + 2a + [2f] + 4a + [4f] + 8a + [8f] + 16a + [16f] + 32a + [32f] ] Grouping terms, we see: [ a + 2a + 4a + 8a + 16a + 32a + ([2f] + [4f] + [8f] + [16f] + [32f]) ] Combining the integer parts: [ 63a + ([2f] + [4f] + [8f] + [16f] + [32f]) ] Given the general inequalities: [ 63a leq a + [2a + 2f] + 4a + 8a + 16a + 32a leq 63a + (1+3+7+15+31) = 63a + 57 ] Thus we obtain: [ 63a leq 12345 leq 63a + 57 ] Solving for (a), we get: [ 63a leq 12345 ] and [ 12345 leq 63a + 57 ] By rearranging these inequalities: [ 63a leq 12345 implies a leq frac{12345}{63} approx 195.1587 ] and [ 12345 leq 63a + 57 implies 12345 - 57 leq 63a implies 12288 leq 63a implies a geq frac{12288}{63} approx 195.0476 ] Hence, combining the two inequalities: [ 195.0476 leq a leq 195.1587 ] The interval ([195.0476, 195.1587]) does not contain any integer, making it impossible for (a) to be an integer.

We know Q's share is Rs. 6,001.89, which corresponds to 2 parts of the profit. To find 1 part of the profit, we divide Q's share by 2: 1 part = 6001.89 ÷ 2 1 part = 3000.945 Now, to find the total profit, we need to add P's share (3 parts) and Q's share (2 parts), which makes 5 parts in total.

Therefore, the number of people selected whose numbers fall within the interval [161, 380] is 11 - 8 = 3. But we made a mistake here.

Given that the angle at O is 60^circ, we recognize that triangle POD is a 30-60-90 triangle. In such triangles, the ratios of the sides are constant: the length of the side opposite the 30^circ angle (which is DO in this case) to the length of the hypotenuse (which is OP) is 1:2, and the length of the side opposite the 60^circ angle (which is DP) to the length of the hypotenuse is sqrt{3}:2. Since OP is the radius of the unit circle, it has a length of 1. Therefore, we can directly apply these ratios to find the lengths of DO and DP: - DO = frac{1}{2}, because it's half the length of the hypotenuse. - DP = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, because it's sqrt{3} times half the length of the hypotenuse.

The total demand for bus and train transportation is determined by the function q(p) = 3000 20p, where p is the minimum fare for a round trip to the center by bus or train, and q is the number of people willing to make the trip at price p. It is known that train transportation is regulated by the state, so the fare for a round trip by train is fixed at 10 units. However, the train can transport no more than 1000 people. (a) What price will the bus company set for the fare if its transportation cost for any number of passengers y is TC(y) = y + 5? (b) There are rumors in the town that due to the unprofitability of train transportation, the train station will soon close, making the bus the only means to get to the center and back.

Given ( p_{text{train}} = 10 ), bus pricing can be handled in two main scenarios: - If ( p_{text{bus}} leq 10 ), all the demand will be met by buses since the bus price matches or undercuts the train price. - If ( p_{text{bus}} > 10 ), first 1000 passengers will use the train since it's cheaper and only the remaining passengers would use the bus. 4. **Profit-maximizing for bus company (Scenario 2: ( p_{text{bus}} > 10 ))**: Calculate the remaining demand for bus rides, given ( p_{text{train}} = 10 ): [ q_{text{bus}}(p) = 3000 - 20p - 1000 = 2000 - 20p quad text{for} quad p > 10. ] 5. **Total cost (TC) for bus company**: The total cost function is given by: [ TC(y) = y + 5, ] where ( y ) represents the number of passengers using the bus. 6. **Revenue (R) and profit ((pi))**: The revenue from bus transportation is: [ R(p) = p times q_{text{bus}}(p) = p (2000 - 20p). ] The profit function will then be: [ pi(p) = R(p) - TC(q_{text{bus}}(p)) = p(2000 - 20p) - (2000 - 20p + 5). ] 7. **Maximizing the profit**: Simplify the profit equation: [ pi(p) = p(2000 - 20p) - (2000 - 20p + 5) = 2000p - 20p^2 - 2000 + 20p - 5 = 2020p - 20p^2 - 2005. ] To find the maximum profit, take the derivative of (pi(p)) with respect to ( p ) and set it to zero: [ frac{dpi}{dp} = 2020 - 40p = 0 implies p = frac{2020}{40} = 50.5. ] Therefore, the optimal price for the bus ride: [ p_{text{bus}} = 50.5 text{ units}. ] 8. **Verify non-negativity of profit**: [ q_{text{bus}}(50.5) = 2000 - 20 times 50.5 = 2000 - 1010 = 990. ] Total revenue: [ R(50.5) = 50.5 times 990 = 50049. ] Total cost: [ TC(990) = 990 + 5 = 995. ] Profit: [ pi = 50049 - 995 = 49054, ] which is positive. 9. **Conclusion for part (a)**: The bus company will set the price at: [ boxed{50.5 text{ units}}. ] --- Part (b): 1. **Demand analysis without the train**: If the train station closes, all the demand must be fulfilled by the bus company.

Now, compute the total sum of the digits in any one decimal place: [ 24 times 15 = 360 ] Since the sum of digits in each decimal place is 360, we will use this sum to compute the total of all four-digit numbers. 7. A four-digit number can be expressed as: [ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ] 8. The total sum is distributed over the four decimal places, so the positions of each digit sum to: [ 360 times (1000 + 100 + 10 + 1) ] 9. Calculate: [ 1000 + 100 + 10 + 1 = 1111 ] 10. Therefore, multiply the sum of the digits by the sum of the weights of the decimal places: [ 360 times 1111 = 360 times (1000 + 100 + 10 + 1) ] 11. Perform the final multiplication: [ 360 times 1111 = 360 times 1111 = 399960 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{399960} ]"},{"prompt":"Tony can run a mile twice as fast as Tina, who with a time of 6 minutes is onethird as fast a runner as Tom.

Now, since Tony can run twice as fast as Tina, his mile time would be half of Tina's time. Therefore, Tony's mile time is: 6 minutes / 2 = 3 minutes Next, we know that Tina is one-third as fast as Tom. This means that Tom can run three times faster than Tina. To find Tom's mile time, we divide Tina's time by 3: 6 minutes / 3 = 2 minutes Now we have all three mile times: Tony's time = 3 minutes Tina's time = 6 minutes Tom's time = 2 minutes To find the total time when added together, we simply add all three times: 3 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 11 minutes Therefore, the total of all three of their mile times when added together is boxed{11} minutes."},{"prompt":"tetrahedron VABC, it is known that VA=VB=VC=sqrt{3}, AB=sqrt{2}, and ∠ACB=frac{π}{4}.

Let's denote the radius of the base of this cone as r. 3. **Radius of the Cone's Base**: Using the relationship between the side length AB and the angle ∠ACB, we find the diameter of the cone's base as 2r = frac{sqrt{2}}{sinfrac{π}{4}} = 2. This simplifies to r = 1. 4. **Height of the Cone**: The height of the cone, which is also the distance from the center of the base to the apex, can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the triangle formed by the height, radius, and generatrix. Since the generatrix is sqrt{3} and the radius is 1, the height is sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2} = sqrt{2}. 5. **Radius of the Circumscribed Sphere (R)**: The center of the circumscribed sphere lies on the height of the cone. By considering the right triangle formed by the sphere's radius, the height of the cone minus the sphere's radius, and the radius of the cone's base, we can write R^2 = (sqrt{2} - R)^2 + 1^2. Solving this equation for R gives R = frac{3sqrt{2}}{4}. 6. **Surface Area of the Circumscribed Sphere**: The surface area A of a sphere with radius R is given by A = 4pi R^2.

Let's proceed with the differentiation step by step: Given the displacement function: S(t) = 2(1-t)^2 Let's differentiate S(t) with respect to t to obtain the velocity function v(t): v(t) = frac{dS}{dt} = frac{d}{dt}[2(1-t)^2] Using the chain rule for differentiation, we get: v(t) = 2 cdot 2(1-t) cdot frac{d}{dt}(1-t) v(t) = 4(1-t)(-1) v(t) = -4(1-t) v(t) = -4 + 4t Now, we need to find the instantaneous velocity at t = 2s.

Let's proceed with a detailed step-by-step solution. 1. **Initial Setup**: - Let S_1 be a circle with diameter AB. - Let S_2 be a circle with center A. - The circles S_1 and S_2 intersect at points C and D. - Line BM intersects S_2 at point M, which lies within S_1, and intersects S_1 again at point N. Our goal is to prove that M N^2 = C N cdot N D. 2. **Intersection Points**: - Let line BM intersect S_2 at another point L. - Let line DN extend to intersect S_2 at another point C_1. 3. **Symmetry Considerations**: - We will prove that the lines DL and CN are symmetric with respect to the line AN. 4. **Angle Considerations**: - Since BN perp NA, we need to verify that angle C N B = angle B N D. - Because the arcs CB and BD on the circle S_1 are equal, the corresponding angles angle CNB and angle BND must be equal. 5. **Symmetric Arcs**: - The arcs C_1M and CL on S_2 are symmetric with respect to line AN, hence they are equal. - Therefore, it follows that angle M D C_1 = angle CML. 6. **Proportional Segments**: - Given that angle C N M = angle M N D, triangles triangle MCN and triangle DMN are similar. - This similarity implies that frac{CN}{MN} = frac{MN}{ND}. 7. **Cross Multiplying for Proportion**: - Cross-multiplying the proportion frac{CN}{MN} = frac{MN}{ND} gives us: [ CN cdot ND = MN^2 ] 8. **Conclusion**: - We have shown that MN^2 = CN cdot ND through the similarity of triangles and angle relationships established from symmetry and geometric properties.

Since B includes all x such that xleqslant -1 and C includes all x from -2 to 2, including both negative and positive values, the union of B and C would include all values from -infty up to 2. So, we have Bcup C={x| xleqslant 2}. - Next, we find the intersection of A and Bcup C. Given that A includes x values from -3 to just below 1, and Bcup C includes all x values up to 2, the intersection will be the set A itself, since all elements of A are included in Bcup C. So, Acap (Bcup C)={x| -3 lt x lt 1}. 2. **For Option B: Acup (Bcap C)** - We calculate Bcap C. Since B includes xleqslant -1 and C ranges from just above -2 to 2 including -1, their intersection includes values that are both greater than -2 and less than or equal to -1. Therefore, Bcap C={x| -2 lt xleqslant -1}. - The union of A with Bcap C essentially combines A's range with the additional segment from Bcap C, which still results in A's original range because the segment from Bcap C is already included in A. Therefore, Acup (Bcap C)={x| -3 lt x lt 1}. 3. **For Option C: Acap complement _{R}(Bcap C)** - First, we find the complement of Bcap C in the real numbers, mathbb{R}. Given Bcap C={x| -2 lt xleqslant -1}, the complement would be all x not in this range, which translates to x > -1 or xleqslant -2. So, complement _{R}(Bcap C)={x| x > -1 or xleqslant -2}. - The intersection of A and this complement would then combine A's range with the condition of the complement, resulting in two disjoint segments: one from -1 to just below 1 and another from -3 to -2. Therefore, Acap complement _{R}(Bcap C)={x| -1 lt x lt 1 or -3 lt xleqslant -2}, which does not match A exactly. 4. **For Option D: (Acap B)cup (Acap C)** - Acap B yields the range where A and B overlap, which is from -3 to -1 since B includes all xleqslant -1. Thus, Acap B={x| -3 lt xleqslant -1}. - Acap C yields the range where A and C overlap, which is the entire range of A since C includes -2 to 2. Thus, Acap C={x| -2 lt x lt 1}. - Taking the union of these two intersections, we essentially cover the entire range of A again, as these intersections overlap and cover A's domain fully. Hence, (Acap B)cup (Acap C)={x| -3 lt x lt 1}. Therefore, the correct options that represent the set {x| -3 lt x lt 1} are A, B, and D.

By the definition of a parabola, we have BM = BF. Additionally, since AM perp MF, and considering that the midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is the circumcenter, point B is the midpoint of segment AF. Finding the coordinates of B and substituting them into the equation of the parabola allows us to solve for the value of p. This problem tests the understanding of the definition of a parabola, its standard equation, and the application of its simple properties. Identifying B as the midpoint of segment AF is key to solving the problem, making it a medium-difficulty question."},{"prompt":"On a plane, there are n points such that any four of them form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral. Prove that these points form the vertices of a convex ngon.","completion":"1. **Consider the convex hull of the given points:** - The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that can enclose all the given points. By definition, this polygon is convex, and its vertices are among the given points. 2. **Structure of the Convex Hull:** - Let's denote the convex hull of these points as a convex polygon with vertices mathbf{CH}(S). We need to show that all n points are vertices of this convex polygon. 3. **Assume for contradiction:** - Suppose there exists a point A (one of the n given points) that is not a vertex of the convex hull mathbf{CH}(S). Then, point A must lie either inside the convex polygon or on its side. 4. **Triangulate the convex polygon:** - Any convex n-gon can be divided into (n-2) triangles by drawing (n-3) diagonals that do not intersect except at their endpoints. Specifically, we can draw diagonals from one vertex to all other non-adjacent vertices. 5. **Point A must lie in one of these triangles:** - Since A is inside or on the boundary of the convex polygon, A must lie inside one of the triangles formed by the triangulation. 6. **Consider a particular triangle triangle ABC:** - Assume A lies inside the triangle triangle XYZ. According to the problem's conditions, the vertices X, Y, Z of this triangle along with point A must form a convex quadrilateral. 7. **Convexity Condition:** - For points X, Y, Z, and A to be the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, all interior angles must be less than 180^circ, which contradicts our assumption that A lies inside triangle XYZ. Specifically, one of the angles would sum with A's contribution to exceed 180^circ, voiding the convexity. 8. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** - Since the assumption that a point A lies inside or on the boundary but not at a vertex leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Hence, every given point must be a vertex of the convex hull. 9. **Final Statement:** - Therefore, all n points are the vertices of a convex n-gon.

Next, consider the condition frac{alpha}{beta^{2}} being a real number. Given alpha and beta, the fraction frac{alpha}{beta^{2}} can be expressed as follows: [ frac{alpha}{beta^{2}} = frac{alpha}{(alpha beta)^{2}} ] 4.

Therefore, f(2x)=2 sqrt{3}sin (2x- frac{π}{6}) or f(2x)=-2 sqrt{3}sin (2x- frac{π}{6}). Since xin[ frac{π}{8}, frac{2π}{3}], we have 2x- frac{π}{6}in[ frac{π}{12}, frac{7π}{6}]. Hence, sin (2x- frac{π}{6})in[- frac{1}{2},1]. Thus, the range of f(2x) on [ frac{π}{8}, frac{2π}{3}] is boxed{[- sqrt{3},2 sqrt{3}]} or boxed{[-2 sqrt{3}, sqrt{3}]}."},{"prompt":"Propose a word problem that can be reduced to solving the inequality: frac{11}{x+1.5}+frac{8}{x} geq frac{12}{x+2}+2","completion":"1. **Formulate the problem into the given inequality**: We need to translate a realistic situation into the inequality: [ frac{11}{x+1.5} + frac{8}{x} geq frac{12}{x+2} + 2 ] Let's consider a scenario where two pedestrians travel between points A and B along two different routes. - The first route is 19 km long. - The second route is 12 km long. The following information is provided: - A pedestrian departs from point A at noon and travels the longer route.

Prove that at least one of the vertices of the triangle T' lies in inside or on the boundary of the polygon M.","completion":"1. **Restate the problem with the convexity condition:** Let ( T ) be a triangle lying completely inside a point-symmetrical convex polygon ( M ). Let ( T' ) be the reflection of the triangle ( T ) in an arbitrary point ( P ) which lies inside the triangle ( T ). Prove that at least one of the vertices of the triangle ( T' ) lies inside or on the boundary of the polygon ( M ). 2. **Define the center of symmetry and vertices:** Let ( O ) be the center of symmetry of the polygon ( M ). Let ( A, B, C ) be the vertices of the triangle ( T ), and let ( A', B', C' ) be the corresponding vertices of the triangle ( T' ). The points ( A', B', C' ) are the reflections of the points ( A, B, C ) in the point ( P ). 3. **Consider the reflections in the center of symmetry:** Since the polygon ( M ) is point-symmetric with respect to the point ( O ), the reflections ( X, Y, Z ) of the points ( A, B, C ) in the point ( O ) all lie inside ( M ). 4. **Special case when ( O = P ):** If ( O = P ), then ( X = A', Y = B' ), and ( Z = C' ), so that everything is trivial. Hence, the only case we need to consider is when ( O neq P ). 5. **Define the ray ( d ) and its intersection with ( triangle ABC ):** Let ( d ) be the ray which falls along the line ( OP ) but begins at the point ( P ) and doesn't contain the point ( O ). Since the point ( P ) lies inside triangle ( ABC ), this ray ( d ) intersects one of the sides of triangle ( ABC ). Assume without loss of generality that this side is the side ( AB ). Let the ray ( d ) intersect the side ( AB ) at a point ( U ). 6. **Reflections and homothety:** Since the point ( U ) lies on the ray ( d ), the point ( P ) lies between the points ( U ) and ( O ). Denoting by ( V ) and ( K ) the reflections of this point ( U ) in the points ( O ) and ( P ), respectively, it clearly follows that the point ( K ) lies between the points ( U ) and ( V ) (since the points ( U, K ), and ( V ) are just the images of the points ( U, P ), and ( O ) in the homothety with center ( U ) and factor 2). 7. **Position of ( V ) and ( K ):** Since the points ( X, Y ), and ( V ) are the reflections of the points ( A, B ), and ( U ) in the point ( O ), from the fact that the point ( U ) lies on the segment ( AB ), it follows that the point ( V ) lies on the segment ( XY ). Similarly, since the points ( A', B' ), and ( K ) are the reflections of the points ( A, B ), and ( U ) in the point ( P ), from the fact that the point ( U ) lies on the segment ( AB ), it follows that the point ( K ) lies on the segment ( A'B' ). 8. **Parallelogram ( ABXY ):** Since the points ( X ) and ( Y ) are the reflections of the points ( A ) and ( B ) in the point ( O ), the quadrilateral ( ABXY ) is a parallelogram with center ( O ). This parallelogram completely lies inside the polygon ( M ) (since ( M ) is convex, and the points ( A, B, X, Y ) lie inside ( M )). 9. **Intersection of segments:** The points ( U ) and ( V ) lie on the sides ( AB ) and ( XY ) of this parallelogram, and the point ( K ), which - as we know - lies between the points ( U ) and ( V ), must therefore lie inside this parallelogram. Now, this point ( K ) lies on the segment ( A'B' ); thus, the segment ( A'B' ) has a common point with the parallelogram ( ABXY ). 10. **Conclusion:** Since the segment ( A'B' ) is parallel and equal to the segment ( AB ), and it has a common point with the parallelogram ( ABXY ), one of the endpoints ( A' ) and ( B' ) of this segment must lie inside or on the boundary of the parallelogram ( ABXY ). We can assume without loss of generality that the point ( A' ) lies inside or on the boundary of the parallelogram ( ABXY ). Since the parallelogram ( ABXY ) itself lies inside the polygon ( M ), it follows that the point ( A' ) lies inside the polygon ( M ). Hence, we have found a vertex of the triangle ( T' ) which lies inside the polygon ( M ).

Therefore, option A is not the best choice for a comprehensive investigation because it suggests a sampling survey rather than a comprehensive one. - **Option B**: Understanding the visual conditions of the students in Class 803 of a certain school can be best achieved by examining each student in the class. This scenario is ideal for a comprehensive survey because it involves collecting detailed information from every individual within a small, defined group. Hence, option B aligns with the requirements for a comprehensive investigation. - **Option C**: Understanding the weekly internet usage of junior high school students in a certain province would require collecting data from a vast number of individuals across various locations. Conducting a comprehensive survey for such a large population would be impractical and resource-intensive.

Therefore, the function f(x) reaches its minimum value, which is also the extreme minimum, at x=1, f(1)= frac {5}{4}. Since f( frac {1}{e})= frac {3}{2}+ frac {1}{4e^{2}} and f(e)= frac {1}{2}+ frac {e^{2}}{4}, it can be concluded that f(e) > f( frac {1}{e}).

We also know that the greatest common divisor of each (a_k) with itself (excluding itself) is denoted as (b_k). It is given that (b_1 > b_2 > cdots > b_{10}). 2. **Defining (b_k):** To understand (b_k) better, let (b_k = frac{a_k}{c_k}), where (c_k) is the smallest prime factor of (a_k). This is because (b_k) cannot be 1 (or a smaller value) without including (a_k) in the divisors, meaning that (c_k) must be a prime factor of (a_k). 3. **Establishing the Relationship for (b_9) and (b_{10}):** Since (b_{9} > b_{10}), we have (b_9 geq c_9 ) (because if ( b_9 leq 1), the sequence can't be decreasing). Consequently, we can conclude (a_{10} > a_9 geq c_9^2). 4. **Analyzing the Sequence (c_k):** Given (a_i < a_{i+1}) for all (i) and the nature of (b_i > b_{i+1}), it follows that (c_i < c_{i+1}). This comes from the fact that (c_k) is the smallest prime factor, meaning the smallest prime factors are ordered as the sequence progresses. 5. **Bounding (c_9):** We need to find lower bounds for (c_i): - (c_1 geq 2) - (c_2 geq 3) - (c_3 geq 5) - (c_4 geq 7) - ... - (c_9 geq 23), since the smallest primes in ascending order up to (c_9) are (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23). 6. **Finding Lower Bound for (a_{10}):** Given (a_{10} > c_9^2), substituting the smallest prime: [ a_{10} > 23^2 = 529 ] 7. **Conclusion:** As (529 > 500), we have: [ a_{10} > 500 ] Therefore, the proof concludes that (a_{10}) must be greater than 500.

Thus, if ( X subseteq B ), consider ( X cup {1} ). - This gives us ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets since ( B ) has ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets. - These subsets ( X cup {1} ) have element 1 in common, ensuring that any pair of these subsets will always have at least element 1 in their intersection. - Therefore, we have constructed ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets all of which pairwise have a non-empty intersection. 3. **Proof by Contradiction for ( k leq 2^{n-1} )**: - Assume that it is possible to choose more than ( k = 2^{n-1} ) subsets from ( A ) such that any two have a non-empty intersection. Suppose ( k > 2^{n-1} ). - Consider all subsets of ( A ) and note that the total number of subsets of ( A ) is ( 2^n ). - We can pair each subset ( X ) with its complement, ( A setminus X ), forming pairs ((X, A setminus X)). Each such pair contains 2 subsets whose intersection is empty. - Since there are ( 2^n ) subsets, there are ( 2^{n-1} ) such pairs. - Out of ( k ) subsets, at least ( k - 1 ) subsets must be placed within the remaining ( 2^{n-1} - 1 ) pairs. - By the Pigeonhole Principle, since ( k > 2^{n-1} ), at least two of these subsets must lie within the same pair ((X, A setminus X)), resulting in their intersection being empty. This contradicts the requirement that any two chosen subsets should have a non-empty intersection. 4. **Conclusion**: - Hence, the maximum number of subsets ( k ) that can be chosen from an ( n )-element set such that any two subsets have a non-empty intersection is ( 2^{n-1} ).

Let AO = a cdot SO and BO = b cdot SO, so from the law of cosines we get: [ AB^2 = (a cdot SO)^2 + (b cdot SO)^2 - (a cdot SO) cdot (b cdot SO) ] Simplifying: [ AB^2 = SO^2(a^2 + b^2 - ab) ] 6. **Simplification and Diagonals**: Since the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at right angles: [ left(1 + a^2right) left(1 + b^2right) = 4 ] where a = frac{AO}{SO} and b = frac{BO}{SO}. 7. **Inequalities Analysis**: Consequently, it's impossible to have both a > 1 and b > 1, or a < 1 and b < 1 simultaneously since: [ (1 + a^2)left(1 + b^2right) = 4 ] holds strictly. If both inequalities a > 1 and b > 1 or a < 1 and b < 1 were true, it would make the left-hand side greater than 4, contradicting the equality. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the angles between the opposite edges of the convex tetrahedral angle cannot be both acute or both obtuse simultaneously.

Flow rate: 7 kmph 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 60 minutes So, 7 kmph = 7 * 1000 meters / 60 minutes = 7000 meters / 60 minutes = 116.67 meters per minute Now we have the flow rate in meters per minute.

From (X = 2n + 1), which implies: [ n = frac{x_k - 1}{2} ] Notice that (x_k) is necessarily odd for all (k), ensuring (n) will be an integer. 5. **Finding the triangular numbers**: Finally, the triangular numbers which are also perfect squares are given by substituting (n) back into (T_n): [ T_n = frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = frac{left(frac{x_k - 1}{2}right) left(frac{x_k - 1}{2} + 1right)}{2} ] Simplifying this gives: [ T_n = frac{x_k^2 - 1}{8} ] # Conclusion: The numbers we seek are (T_n = frac{x_k^2 - 1}{8}), where (x_k) is given by the solutions to the Pell's equation.

If we alternate perfectly: - The arrangement will be H, W, H, W, ..., H, W. - In such an arrangement, every W is flanked by two Hs (as we're considering a circular series).

The product of the altitudes h_b and h_c is: [ h_b h_c = left(frac{2S}{b}right) left(frac{2S}{c}right) = frac{4S^2}{bc} ] 5. Using the area S = 3, we have: [ h_b h_c = frac{4 times 3^2}{bc} = frac{36}{bc} ] 6. To maximize h_b h_c, we need to minimize bc.

We know that the sum of any seven of these eight numbers must be non-negative. This implies that if we remove any one number, the remaining seven numbers must sum up to a non-negative value. 3.

The conclusion is clearly established as true. 3. **Inductive Step:** Assume the conclusion holds for ( n ), i.e., there exist ( n ) integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) such that: [ 0 < a_2 - a_1 leq a_3 - a_2 leq cdots leq a_n - a_{n-1} leq m_n ] 4. **Consider ( n+1 ):** Evaluate ( S_{n+1} ) and the difference: [ S_{n+1} = frac{1}{6} (n+1) left( (n+1)^2 + 5 right) ] Simplifying: [ S_{n+1} - S_n = frac{1}{6} (n+1) left( (n+1)^2 + 5 right) - frac{1}{6} n left( n^2 + 5 right) ] [ S_{n+1} - S_n = frac{1}{6} [ (n+1) ((n+1)^2 + 5) - n (n^2 + 5) ] ] Expanding: [ = frac{1}{6} left( n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 + 5n + 5 - n^3 - 5n right) = frac{1}{6} left( 3n^2 + 3n + 6 right) ] Simplifying: [ = frac{1}{6} cdot 3( n^2 + n + 2 ) = frac{1}{2} left( n^2 + n + 2 right) = m_n + n ] 5. **Evaluating ( m_{n+1} - m_n ):** [ m_{n+1} = frac{1}{2} left( (n+1)^2 - (n+1) + 2 right) ] [ m_{n+1} - m_n = frac{1}{2} left( (n^2 + 2n + 1) - (n+1) + 2 right) - frac{1}{2} left( n^2 - n + 2 right) ] Simplifying: [ m_{n+1} - m_n = frac{1}{2} left( n^2 + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 2 right) - frac{1}{2} left( n^2 - n + 2 right) ] [ = frac{1}{2} left( n^2 + n + 2 right) - frac{1}{2} n^2 = n ] Hence, ( m_{n+1} - m_n = n ). 6. **Constructing Values for ( n+1 ):** Consider the sequence ( a_{n} + m_{n}, a_{n} + m_{n} + 1, ldots, a_{n} + m_{n} + n ).

Question: Is it possible for this polynomial to be a perfect square? 1. **Identify and Square Each Term**: We are given the numbers 1, 2, ldots, 1982. Squaring each of these numbers, we can obtain 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ldots, 1982^2. These squared numbers have varying properties modulo 3. 2. **Properties Modulo 3**: Notice the following properties: - If 3 mid a, then 3 mid a^2 (i.e., a^2 equiv 0 pmod{3}). - If 3 nmid a, then a equiv 1 or a equiv 2 pmod{3}. Consequently, a^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}. 3. **Contribution of Each Type to the Sum**: Let's count the number of multiples of 3 within the range 1 to 1982.

Each of the 1322 remaining numbers will contribute 1 pmod{3} since (a mod 3)^2 = 1 if a neq 0 pmod{3}.

Points M and P are the midpoints of sides BC and CD respectively of convex quadrilateral ABCD. 2. It is known that AM + AP = a. We are required to prove that the area of quadrilateral ABCD is less than frac{a^2}{2}. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Area Relation**: Start by expressing the area of the quadrilateral ABCD in terms of the areas of constituent triangles. Let S_{ABCD} denote the area of quadrilateral ABCD. Note that: [ S_{ABCD} = S_{AMPC} + S_{BMD} + S_{DAC} ] 2. **Midline Theorem Application**: Using the midpoints M and P of BC and CD respectively, we can express the area S_{AMPC} in terms of S_{ABCD}. Since M and P are midpoints: [ S_{AMPC} = frac{1}{2} S_{ABCD} ] 3. **Assigning Variables**: Define the distances in terms of x and a-x: [ AM = x quad text{and} quad AP = a - x ] 4. **Area of Triangle AMPC**: To find an upper bound for S_{AMPC}, we observe that: [ S_{AMPC} < S_{Delta AMP} ] where Delta AMP is the triangle formed with AM and AP as two of its sides. 5. **Area Formula via Semiperimeter**: The area S_{Delta AMP} can be approximated using the semiperimeter method or by recognizing the bounds on a maximal triangle. 6. **Bounding the Area**: From geometric properties, we use the fact that: [ S_{Delta AMP} leq frac{1}{2} cdot x cdot (a - x) ] 7. **Simplifying the Inequality**: [ S_{Delta AMP} leq frac{x(a - x)}{2} = frac{a}{2} cdot frac{a - x}{2} ] We know x(a - x) achieves its maximum at x = frac{a}{2}.

Therefore, the sufficiency is not satisfied, and proposition p is true. 2. Determine the truth of proposition q. The negation of a universal proposition is a particular proposition. Proposition q states: ∀x∈left( left. 0, dfrac{π}{2} right. right), sin x= dfrac{1}{2}. Its negation is ∃x_{0}∈left( left. 0, dfrac{π}{2} right. right), sin x_{0}≠ dfrac{1}{2}, which is true since not all x in the interval left(0, dfrac{π}{2}right) satisfy sin x = dfrac{1}{2}. 3. Now, we will determine which option is true. Since propositions p and q are both true, the true proposition is p∧q.

We can divide the entire equation by ( e^{k_1 x} ) to obtain: [ alpha_1 e^{(k_1 - k_1) x} + alpha_2 e^{(k_2 - k_1) x} + alpha_3 e^{(k_3 - k_1) x} equiv 0 ] Simplifying, we get: [ alpha_1 + alpha_2 e^{(k_2 - k_1) x} + alpha_3 e^{(k_3 - k_1) x} equiv 0 ] 3. **Differentiate the equation**: Differentiate both sides of the above equation with respect to ( x ): [ alpha_2 (k_2 - k_1) e^{(k_2 - k_1) x} + alpha_3 (k_3 - k_1) e^{(k_3 - k_1) x} equiv 0 ] 4. **Normalize the second equation**: Divide this new equation by ( e^{(k_2 - k_1) x} ): [ alpha_2 (k_2 - k_1) + alpha_3 (k_3 - k_1) e^{(k_3 - k_2) x} equiv 0 ] 5. **Differentiate the second normalized equation**: Differentiate the above equation with respect to ( x ): [ alpha_3 (k_3 - k_1)(k_3 - k_2) e^{(k_3 - k_2) x} equiv 0 ] 6. **Analyze the result**: Since ( alpha_3 neq 0 ), ( k_3 neq k_1 ), and ( k_3 neq k_2 ), it must be that [ e^{(k_3 - k_2) x} equiv 0 ] However, ( e^{(k_3 - k_2) x} ) cannot be zero for any ( x ) on the interval ( (-infty, +infty) ). 7. **Contradiction**: This leads to a contradiction.

Rearranging this equation gives us y = x + 2, indicating a slope of 1. - **Step 2:** Since parallel lines have equal slopes, the equation of the line parallel to l can be written as y = x + b. To find b, we need to substitute the coordinates of point A(3,-1) into this equation. - **Step 3:** Substituting A(3,-1) into y = x + b gives -1 = 3 + b. Solving for b, we find that b = -4. Therefore, the equation of the line is y = x - 4. The equation of the line parallel to l passing through point A(3,-1) is boxed{y = x - 4}. For (2) Find the length of the chord MN intercepted by line l on the circle x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+4y-12=0. - **Step 1:** Express the circle's equation in standard form. Starting with x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+4y-12=0, completing the squares for x and y terms gives us the standard form (x-2)^{2}+(y+2)^{2}=20. This reveals the circle's center at (2,-2) and its radius r = 2sqrt{5}. - **Step 2:** To find the distance d from the center of the circle (2,-2) to the line l: x-y+2=0, we apply the distance formula. Note that there's a slight correction here: the center of the circle is (2, -2), but the distance formula calculation only involves the line's coefficients and the circle's center. The formula for distance d from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Applying this to our scenario gives us d = frac{|2-(-2)+2|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}} = frac{|6|}{sqrt{2}} = 3sqrt{2}. - **Step 3:** The length of the chord MN can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, the distance d from the center to the line, and half the chord length as the sides. The length of the chord is |MN| = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2} = 2sqrt{(2sqrt{5})^2 - (3sqrt{2})^2} = 2sqrt{20 - 18} = 2sqrt{2}.

Find ( p(x) ).","completion":"Analyzing the given polynomial ( p(x) = x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 ), we are provided with the information that for any root ( alpha ), the numbers ( frac{1}{alpha} ) and ( 1-alpha ) are also roots. Since ( p(x) ) is a fifth-degree polynomial, it can have at most five roots. Given this, we need to account for all possible roots of the polynomial based on the given constraints. 1. **Evaluate Roots Based on Given Conditions:** If ( alpha ) is a root of ( p(x) ), then ( frac{1}{alpha} ) and ( 1 - alpha ) are also roots. Additionally, if ( alpha neq 1 ), ( frac{1}{1-alpha} ), ( 1 - frac{1}{alpha} ), and ( 1 - frac{1}{1-alpha} ) are also roots. Hence, we have six potential roots: ( alpha, frac{1}{alpha}, 1-alpha, frac{1}{1-alpha}, 1-frac{1}{alpha}, 1-frac{1}{1-alpha} ). 2. **Determine Possible Values for ( alpha ):** Since ( p(x) ) is a polynomial of degree 5, there must be overlap among these roots. Consider these conditions: - If ( alpha = frac{1}{alpha} ), then ( alpha^2 = 1 ) so ( alpha = pm1 ). - If ( alpha = 1 - alpha ), then ( 2alpha = 1 ) so ( alpha = frac{1}{2} ). - If ( alpha = frac{1}{1-alpha} ), then ( alpha (1-alpha) = 1 ) so ( alpha^2 - alpha + 1 = 0 ). Solving this gives ( alpha = frac{1}{2} pm frac{sqrt{3}}{2} mathrm{i} ). Thus, the possible values for ( alpha ) are ( -1, frac{1}{2}, 2, frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} mathrm{i}, frac{1}{2} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} mathrm{i} ). 3. **Construct Polynomial ( p(x) ):** Knowing the roots, we can form the polynomial: [ p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2)left(x^2 - x + 1right) ] Upon complete analysis, the following forms for ( p(x) ) are valid: [ begin{array}{l} text{1. } p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2)left(x^2 - x + 1right), text{2. } p(x) = (x+1)^3left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2), text{3. } p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)^3(x-2), text{4. } p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2)^3, text{5. } p(x) = (x+1)^2left(x-frac{1}{2}right)^2(x-2), text{6. } p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)^2(x-2)^2, text{7. } p(x) = (x+1)^2left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2)^2. end{array} ] These polynomial forms capture the possible multiplicities of the roots while respecting the degree condition. 4. **Special Case: ( alpha = 1 ):** If ( alpha = 1 ), then ( (x-1)^5 ) is also a valid polynomial: [ p(x) = (x-1)^5 ] # Conclusion: Thus, the polynomial ( p(x) ) can be expressed in one of the following forms: [ boxed{ begin{array}{l} p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2)left(x^2 - x + 1right), p(x) = (x+1)^3left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2), p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)^3(x-2), p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2)^3, p(x) = (x+1)^2left(x-frac{1}{2}right)^2(x-2), p(x) = (x+1)left(x-frac{1}{2}right)^2(x-2)^2, p(x) = (x+1)^2left(x-frac{1}{2}right)(x-2)^2, p(x) = (x-1)^5. end{array} } ]"},{"prompt":"Three individuals, A, B, and C, are independently decrypting a code.

The key lies in introducing a parameter to represent the distance from the point to the line and then finding the maximum distance within the parameter's range. A common approach is to utilize the parametric equation of the ellipse. Using the parametric equation of the ellipse, we can solve the problem. From the standard equation of the ellipse, we can derive its parametric equation. Let's denote an arbitrary point on the ellipse as (4cosalpha, 2sinalpha). Substitute this into the formula for the distance from a point to a line and simplify it into a trigonometric function with one angle. Then, utilize the bounded property of the sine function to find the maximum value. Solution steps: 1. Given the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1, 2. We can represent any point P on the ellipse as (4cosalpha, 2sinalpha). 3. Thus, the distance d from point P to the line x + 2y - sqrt{2} = 0 is given by: d = frac{|4cosalpha + 2 cdot 2sinalpha - sqrt{2}|}{sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} =frac{|4sqrt{2}sin(alpha + frac{pi}{4}) - sqrt{2}|}{sqrt{5}}. 4.

There are no choices here; it's fixed. 3. **Choices for Saturday:** - Since cake is served on Friday, Saturday's dessert can be either pie, ice cream, or pudding. - Thus, there are 3 choices for Saturday. 4. **Choices for Thursday:** - Since cake is already determined for Friday, Thursday's dessert can be either pie, ice cream, or pudding. - Thus, there are 3 choices for Thursday. 5. **Choices for the remaining days (Sunday to Wednesday):** - For each of these days, the dessert choice is constrained only by the dessert of the previous day (i.e., it cannot be the same). - Therefore, for each of these days, there are 3 choices (any of the four desserts minus the one served the day before). 6. **Calculate the total number of dessert menus:** - The total number of choices for the week is the product of choices for each day. - Since Friday's choice is fixed, we consider the choices for the other 6 days. - Each of these 6 days has 3 choices, leading to a total of (3^6) possible combinations. 7. **Perform the calculation:** [ 3^6 = 729 ] 8. **Conclusion:** - The total number of different dessert menus for the week, given the constraints, is (boxed{729})."},{"prompt":"Given f(alpha)= dfrac {sin (3pialpha)cos (2pialpha)sin ( dfrac {3pi}{2}alpha)}{cos (pialpha)sin (pialpha)} (1) Simplify f(alpha) (2) If alpha is an angle in the second quadrant, and cos ( dfrac {pi}{2}+alpha)= dfrac {1}{3}, find the value of f(alpha).","completion":"Solution: (1) f(alpha)= dfrac {sin (3pi-alpha)cos (2pi-alpha)sin ( dfrac {3pi}{2}-alpha)}{cos (pi-alpha)sin (-pi-alpha)}= dfrac {sin alphacdot cos alphacdot (-cos alpha)}{-cos alpha cdot sin alpha }=cos alpha． (2) Since alpha is an angle in the second quadrant, and cos ( dfrac {pi}{2}+alpha)=-sin alpha=- dfrac {1}{3}, therefore sin alpha= dfrac {1}{3}, Because alpha is an angle in the second quadrant, therefore f(alpha)=cos alpha=- sqrt {1-sin ^{2}alpha}=- dfrac {2 sqrt {2}}{3}． Therefore, the final answers are: (1) f(alpha) = boxed{cos alpha} (2) f(alpha) = boxed{- dfrac {2 sqrt {2}}{3}}"},{"prompt":"Find all surjective functions f: mathbb{N}to mathbb{N} such that for all m,nin mathbb{N} : [m vert n Longleftrightarrow f(m) vert f(n).]","completion":"1. **Observation and Initial Condition**: - Given that ( f ) is surjective, for any ( n in mathbb{N} ), there exists some ( m in mathbb{N} ) such that ( f(m) = n ). - Since ( f ) is surjective and ( m mid n Longleftrightarrow f(m) mid f(n) ), we start by considering ( n = 1 ). The only ( m ) such that ( m mid 1 ) is ( m = 1 ). Therefore, ( f(1) = 1 ). 2. **Behavior on Primes**: - Consider any prime ( p ). Since ( p ) has only two divisors (1 and ( p )), ( f(p) ) must also have only two divisors. Hence, ( f(p) ) must be a prime number. - Define a function ( g ) that maps primes to primes such that ( f(p) = g(p) ) for all primes ( p ). Since ( f ) is surjective, ( g ) must be a bijection on the set of primes. 3. **Induction on Prime Powers**: - We use strong induction to show that ( f(p^k) = g(p)^k ) for all positive integers ( k ). - **Base Case**: For ( k = 1 ), we have ( f(p) = g(p) ), which is true by definition. - **Inductive Step**: Assume ( f(p^j) = g(p)^j ) for all ( j leq k ). We need to show ( f(p^{k+1}) = g(p)^{k+1} ). - ( f(p^{k+1}) ) must be divisible by ( 1, g(p), g(p)^2, ldots, g(p)^k ) and itself, but no other primes. - The number of divisors of ( f(p^{k+1}) ) must be ( k+2 ) (since ( tau(p^{k+1}) = k+2 )). - If ( f(p^{k+1}) ) had any prime factors other than ( g(p) ), the number of divisors would exceed ( k+2 ), which is a contradiction. - Therefore, ( f(p^{k+1}) ) must be ( g(p)^{k+1} ). 4. **General Case for Natural Numbers**: - Suppose ( n ) is any positive integer and ( p ) is a prime that does not divide ( n ). We need to show ( f(n)f(p^k) = f(np^k) ) for all positive integers ( k ). - Since ( (n, p^k) = 1 ), we have ( tau(n) tau(p^k) = tau(np^k) ). - We know ( g(p)^k mid f(np^k) ) and ( g(p) nmid f(n) ). Thus, all divisors of ( f(n) ) divide ( f(np^k) ), and ( g(p)^k ) divides ( f(np^k) ) as well. - The number of divisors of ( f(n)g(p)^k ) is ( tau(f(n)) tau(g(p)^k) = tau(n) tau(p^k) = tau(np^k) ). - If ( f(np^k) ) had any other divisors, ( tau(f(np^k)) ) would exceed ( tau(f(n)g(p)^k) ), which is a contradiction. - Therefore, ( f(np^k) = f(n)g(p)^k = f(n)f(p^k) ). 5. **Conclusion**: - Since we have defined ( f ) for all prime powers and shown that ( f ) respects the multiplicative property for coprime numbers, the function ( f ) is completely determined by the bijection ( g ) on primes. - Thus, the function ( f ) can be written as ( f(n) = g(p_1)^{e_1} g(p_2)^{e_2} cdots g(p_k)^{e_k} ) where ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ) is the prime factorization of ( n ).

This property has significant structural implications for ( G ). 4. **Bound on Intersection Sizes**: One of the key details is that in the tree decomposition, the intersection ( V_t cap V_{t'} ) for an edge ( tt' ) in the decomposition tree ( T ) has a bounded size. Specifically, the size of the intersection is at most ( 2k + n ). 5. **Implications for Treewidth**: Without the presence of ( K^n ) as a minor, and given the bounded size of intersections in the tree decomposition, it follows that these graphs have sufficiently small treewidth. This conclusion is based on the observation that excluding a complete graph minor leads to constraints on how complex the graph's structure can be, reflected in the bounded size of tree decomposition bags. 6. **Tree Decpomposition Bags in Nearly Embeddable Surfaces**: The bags in the tree decomposition reside on a surface where the graph can be nearly embedded without containing ( K^n ). This points to a structural property of the graph that restricts it to surfaces where the tree decomposition structure can be compact. 7. **Formulation of ( k )**: The theorem guarantees the existence of some integer ( k ) such that the described conditions hold. The construction or determination of this ( k ) hinges on earlier results by Robertson and Seymour about graph minors and structural graph theory. 8. **Generalization to Infinite Graphs**: The statement concludes by noting that Theorem 12.4.11 also applies to infinite graphs, further emphasizing the robustness of the structural constraints applied by the exclusion of certain minors. # Conclusion: The detailed understanding of Theorem 12.4.11 confirms that for any ( n geqslant 5 ), there indeed exists a natural number ( k ) such that any graph ( G ) not containing ( K^n ) as a minor will have a tree decomposition where the bags are on a surface where the intersection sizes are bounded and the tree decomposition bags comply with the stated properties.

She worked there for 3 years, and there are 12 months in a year, so she worked for 3 years * 12 months/year = 36 months. At 5000 per month, she earned 36 months * 5000/month = 180,000 at her old company. Now, let's find out how much she earns at her new company. She's earning 20% more than 5000, which is her old salary. 20% of 5000 is 0.20 * 5000 = 1000. So, at her new company, she earns 5000 + 1000 = 6000 per month. Since she has worked for her new company five months longer than her old company, she has worked there for 36 months + 5 months = 41 months.

We need to adapt the theorem to our context. 3. **Analyzing the Given Equation:** Let's rewrite the given equation: [ AB - FG = frac{MF cdot AG + MG cdot BF}{CM} ] Notice that ( F ) and ( G ) are the feet of the perpendiculars from ( M ) to ( BC ) and ( AC ), respectively. This implies that ( MF perp BC ) and ( MG perp AC ). 4. **Considering the Circumcenter ( O ):** The circumcenter ( O ) of an acute triangle ( ABC ) is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect. It is also the center of the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Locus of ( M ):** To satisfy the given equation, ( M ) must lie on the line ( CO ), where ( O ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ).

We aim to find the minimum number of even numbers satisfying this constraint among the 101 natural numbers written in a circle. 2. **Considering Triplets**: Let's try breaking down the sequence into groups of three consecutive numbers: - Denote the numbers as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{101} ). - For every triplet ( (a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}) ), at least one number must be even. 3. **Establishing a Repetition Pattern**: To cover all numbers effectively: - Consider fixing one even number in each possible triplet. For example, if ( a_1 ) is even, then: [ (a_1, a_2, a_3) rightarrow text{one even number} ] 4. **Dividing the Numbers into Groups**: We know that: - There are 101 numbers. - Apart from the first fixed number ( a_1 ) and its neighbor, the remaining 99 numbers can be divided into 33 triplet groups (i.e., ( 99 = 3 times 33 )). Hence, every group of three numbers will contain at least one even number. 5. **Total Even Numbers**: From the fixed number ( a_1 ): - We have an initial ( 1 ) even number. - For the 33 triplet groups, each triplet needs at least one even number, so we add ( 33 ) more even numbers.

Consider taking numbers with the positions ( 1, 4, 7, ldots, 100 ).

We know that for such ( n ), there exists a positive integer ( h ) such that ( 10^h equiv 1 pmod{n} ). This is due to the fact that ( n ) and 10 are coprime, thanks to **Fermat's Little Theorem**. Specifically: [ 10^h equiv 1 pmod{n} ] 2. **Construct the Number ( N )**: Consider the number ( N ) constructed as a sum of digits in two parts. Let: [ N = (10^h + 10^{2h} + 10^{3h} + cdots + 10^{Ah}) + (10^{h+1} + 10^{2h+1} + 10^{3h+1} + cdots + 10^{Bh+1}) ] Here, each term in the first group is congruent to ( 1 pmod{n} ) (since ( 10^h equiv 1 pmod{n} )), and each term in the second group is congruent to ( 10 pmod{n} ) (since ( 10^{h+1} equiv 10 pmod{n} )). 3. **Simplifying the Congruences**: This setup gives us: [ N equiv A cdot 1 + B cdot 10 pmod{n} ] Thus, [ N equiv A + 10B pmod{n} ] We observe that ( N ) is comprised of ( A + B ) digits that sum to ( A + B ). 4. **Finding Values of ( A ) and ( B )**: We want ( A + B = k ). Since ( N ) is relatively prime to 9, one of the values ( k, k + 9, k + 2 cdot 9, ldots, k + (n-1) cdot 9 ) must be congruent to ( 0 pmod{n} ). We can find ( B ) such that: [ k + 9B equiv 0 pmod{n} ] Now, we take: [ B equiv -frac{k}{9} pmod{n} quad text{with} quad 0 le B < n ] Then, ( A ) can be calculated as: [ A = k - B ] Given ( k ge n ), ( A ) will be positive. 5. **Constructing the Multiple**: With ( A ) and ( B ) found, our constructed ( N ): [ N equiv 0 pmod{n} ] Hence, ( N ) is a multiple of ( n ) and it has a digit sum of ( k ). 6. **Handling Cases where ( n ) is Divisible by 2 or 5**: If ( n = 2^a cdot 5^b cdot m ) where ( m ) is not divisible by 2 or 5, we can find ( N ) which is a multiple of ( m ) with a sum of digits ( k ). Multiplying such an ( N ) by ( 10^c ) (where ( c = max(a, b) )) ensures it is a multiple of ( n ) satisfying the original condition. 7. **Example Verification**: Consider ( n = 19 ) and ( k = 22 ).

Let's assume the first candidate lied. According to their statement, the number of false statements before their claim would have been 0 (as 1 was mentioned). Since they lied, the count after their statement would be incremented by 1, making it actually 1. 2. However, if we continue with this consideration: - The second candidate states that there have been 2 false claims. If the first candidate already lied, the number of lies before the second candidate's claim is (1). Since the second statement is a lie, increment the previous total: (1 + 1 neq 2). Thus, the second candidate also lies. - By the same logic, continuing this process for each candidate will show that all 12 candidates would have been lying, creating a contradiction since the problem states there needs to be at least one accurate count. 3. To resolve this contradiction, we conclude that the first candidate must have told the truth. Hence, the number of false statements before the first candidate's claim was indeed 0. After the first candidate's truthful statement, the count remains 1. - The second candidate consequently lies because their statement must have matched the increment: (1 + 1 neq 2). - Similarly, the third candidate lies because the actual false statements now are (2, and (2 + 1 neq 3). 4. Applying similar logic, we continue this for all candidates from the third up to the twelfth: - The (n^{th}) candidate's statement would be (n), and since we have established one truth at the beginning, it does not match the incremented actual total of ((n-1) + 1). 5. Therefore, all subsequent candidates (from the second to the twelfth) lie about the count of false statements before their turn, making a total of (11 lies). 6. Additionally, before any discussion, one lie was accounted as described in the problem statement. **Conclusion**: Summing up all the lies gives us a total of (11 + 1 = 12) false statements by all candidates involved.

The section will intersect PA and PC at points that divide these lines in the ratio of 2:1. Since G is the centroid, it divides the median into two segments with a ratio of 2:1, which means the section will also intersect the median of triangle PAC in the same ratio. This implies that the distances from the vertices to the points of intersection on the sides are two-thirds of the lengths of the sides. 2. Similarly, the section will intersect AB and BC at points that divide these lines in the same ratio because it is parallel to AC and PB. This means the lengths of the segments on AB and BC included in the section are two-thirds of AB and BC, respectively. 3. Since the section is parallel to AC and PB, the lengths of the segments on the section parallel to AC and PB are equal to AC and PB, respectively. Therefore, the length of the segment parallel to AC is 3, and the length of the segment parallel to PB is 6. 4. The perimeter of the section is the sum of the lengths of these segments. Since the section is a parallelogram (as it is parallel to two lines and intersects the sides of triangle PAC), its perimeter is twice the sum of the lengths of the sides parallel to AC and PB.

Consider a necklace composed of ( 3n ) blue stones and ( 3n ) green stones, arranged such that any three consecutive stones are of different colors. 甲 (Player A) and 乙 (Player B) play a game where they alternately remove three adjacent stones, following these rules: 1. In each of their turns, 甲 must remove three stones arranged in the order green, blue, green ((GBT)). 2. In each of their turns, 乙 must remove three stones arranged in the order blue, green, blue ((BGB)). The goal is to prove that, if the game finishes after ( 2n ) turns, all the stones are removed; if 甲 can succeed if they go first, then 乙 can also succeed if they go first. Step-by-step proof: 1. **Notation:** Let green stones be denoted as ( T ) and blue stones as ( S ). 2. **Chain Structure:** In the necklace, if we draw a delimiter between any two adjacent stones of the same color (except between the same type of delimiter previously drawn), the necklace will form several “zigzag shapes” (alternating patterns). Each zigzag shape starts and ends with different colors, and there are at most ( 2n ) delimited sections since there are ( 3n ) green stones and ( 3n ) blue stones. 3. **Adjacent Stones:** Within these delimiters, there is no sequence of three adjacent stones of the same color, making it impossible to have a length-1 zigzag shape. 4. **Strategies to Remove Stones:** In each turn, one player can remove three adjacent stones that satisfy their required arrangement (either ( GBT ) or ( BGB )). Each action affects at most one delimiter at a time. Considering any three adjacent stones that a player can remove: - **Case 1:** Configuration ( cdots ST|TS|TS cdots rightarrow cdots ST|TS cdots ) This reduces one delimiter and merges two zigzag shapes into one. - **Case 2:** Configuration ( cdots TS|ST|ST cdots rightarrow cdots TS|TS cdots ) This reduces one delimiter and merges two zigzag shapes into one. - **Case 3:** Configuration ( cdots TS|TST|S cdots rightarrow cdots T|T cdots ) This increases one delimiter, splitting one zigzag shape into two. 5. **Effect on Delimiters:** In each step, the player’s move usually either reduces one delimiter by merging shapes or potentially adds one delimiter by splitting shapes. Thus, the number of separators after each move decreases or stays the same. 6. **Ensuring No Stones Remaining:** If the initial number of delimiters is ( 2n ), then after ( 2n ) moves, where every turn removes or adjusts delimiters appropriately, the necklace will be entirely cleared of stones. 7. **Conclusion:** Since both players make moves alternately and appropriately following the rules to reduce the delimiters progressively, the winning strategy for either default player (whether 甲 goes first or 乙 goes first) ensures that whoever starts can finish. Thus, if 甲 can guarantee a win if they start,乙 can also guarantee a win following a logical removal sequence based on the initial configurations to progressively clear all stones.

For x neq 0, let's take x_1 = -1 and x_2 = x: f(-1) + f(x) = f(-x) f(-x) - f(x) = -f(-1). This implies that f(-x) = f(x) + C, where C = -f(-1). To find C, let's take x=1: f(-1) = f(1) + C C = f(-1) - f(1) C = f(-1) - 0 C = f(-1). Therefore, we have f(-x) = f(x) + f(-1). If we now take x=1 in the original equation with x_1=x and x_2=1, we get: f(x) + f(1) = f(x cdot 1) f(x) + f(1) = f(x) f(1) = 0, which has already been established, hence f(-x) = f(x) for all x in domain D.

Now, for n geq 1, let's determine f(2^n) using f(2) and the functional equation: f(2^n) = f(2^{n-1} cdot 2) = f(2^{n-1}) + f(2) = f(2^{n-1}) + 2. Applying this recursively, we see that: f(2^n) = f(2^{n-1}) + 2 = ldots = f(2) + 2(n-1) = 2 + 2(n-1) = 2n. Thus, a_n = (-1)^n cdot f(2^n) = (-1)^n cdot 2n.

By the given condition that the angles form an arithmetic progression, we can write the following relation: 2B = A + C. By knowing that the sum of interior angles in any triangle is 180°, we have: A + B + C = 180°. Substituting 2B for A + C from the arithmetic progression condition into this equation, we get: A + 2B + C = 180° 2B + 2B = 180° 4B = 180° B = dfrac{180°}{4} B = 45°. This is incorrect as B should be 60° based on the premise of the problem. It seems there has been a mistake in the translation or interpretation of the initial solution. Let's attempt to correct this: From 2B = A + C and knowing that A, B, and C are in an arithmetic progression, we have: B - A = C - B. By substitution, this becomes: B - A = C - (180° - A - C) B - A = C - 180° + A + C 2B = 2A + 2C - 180° 2B = 180° B = 90°. This must be revisited as we know no angle in a triangle can be 90° given the other two angles must also have nonzero values. Let's correct the arithmetic accordingly. Combining the arithmetic progression relationship and the sum of angles, we have: B-A = C-B text{ and } A+B+C=180°. Adding these two equations, we get: A+2B+C=2B+180° 2A+2C=180°. Dividing this equation by 2, we find that: A+C=90°. Substituting it back to our arithmetic progression relation, we get: 2B=A+C=90°, and therefore, B = dfrac{90°}{2} = 45°, which is also incorrect as it conflicts with the given statement that one of the angles is 60°. The correct approach should be to use the arithmetic progression relations directly. If the angles are in arithmetic progression, say A = B - x and C = B + x for some common difference x. So we have: A + B + C = (B - x) + B + (B + x) = 3B = 180°, resulting in the conclusion that: B = frac{180°}{3} = 60°. This asserts that angle B is 60°. Now let's consider the geometric progression of sides. Let the sides of the triangle ABC opposite to the angles A, B, and C be a, b, and c, respectively, in geometric progression. This implies: frac{a}{b} = frac{b}{c} implies b^2 = ac. Using the law of cosines for angle B, we have: b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2accos(B), and since we have established B = 60°, and cos(60°) = frac{1}{2}, the equation simplifies to: b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - ac. From the condition of geometric progression b^2 = ac, and replacing it in the above equation, we get: ac = a^2 + c^2 - ac, and this simplifies to: 0 = a^2 - 2ac + c^2 = (a - c)^2. Therefore, we have a - c = 0, meaning a = c. Since we have a = c and angle B is 60°, by the properties of triangles, we can conclude that: A = C = 60°. Thus, triangle ABC is equilateral, and all of its angles are 60°.

Part (a): If an exotic number is odd, then it is a perfect square. 1. **Understand the number n and its divisors**: Let n be a positive integer expressed in its prime factorization as: [ n = p_1^{k_1} cdot p_2^{k_2} cdots p_ell^{k_ell} ] The number of positive divisors of n, denoted by d(n), is given by: [ d(n) = (k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) cdots (k_ell + 1) = prod_{i=1}^{ell} (k_i + 1) ] 2. **Analyzing odd exotic number**: Given that n is exotic and odd, all of its factors must also be odd. 3. **Properties of k_1, k_2, ldots, k_ell**: Since n is exotic (d(n) mid n), d(n) must divide n. For n to be odd and have a number of divisors d(n), upon examining the formula for d(n), each term (k_i + 1) must be odd (since the product of odd numbers is odd).

Thus, [ d(n) mid n ] since ( p ) divides ( p^{p-1} ). 4. **Conclusion**: Since there are infinitely many primes, there are infinitely many numbers of the form ( p^{p-1} ), each of which is exotic.

Now, we calculate the remainder when divided by 12: - Divide 987,543 by 12: ( 987,543 div 12 approx 82378.5833 ). - Calculate the integer part of the division: ( 82378 ). - Calculate the product of the integer part and 12: ( 82378 times 12 = 988536 ). - Subtract this product from the original number to find the remainder: ( 987,543 - 988536 = -993 ). Since we calculated the wrong way (subtracting a larger number from a smaller number), we should actually perform ( 987543 - 82378 times 12 ) again: - Correct calculation: ( 987543 - 988536 = -993 ), which is incorrect since it must be non-negative.

Clearly, it can be colored using 3 distinct colors, one for each vertex. This satisfies the requirement that all vertices in the triangle have different colors. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement is true for any polygon with ( n ) vertices, i.e., any such polygon triangulated with non-intersecting diagonals can be colored with three colors such that all vertices of each triangle are of different colors. - We need to show that the statement also holds for a polygon with ( n + 1 ) vertices. 3. **Choosing a Special Triangle:** - Select a triangle in the triangulated polygon with ( n + 1 ) vertices that shares two of its sides with the polygon's boundary (refer to Problem 22.25 for details on choosing such a triangle). - This triangle must exist because it can be proven by induction that in any triangulation of a polygon, you can always find such a triangle. 4. **Remove the Triangle:** - Let's denote this triangle by ( triangle ABC ), where ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are the vertices, and sides ( AB ) and ( BC ) lie on the boundary of the polygon. - Remove ( triangle ABC ) from the polygon. This reduces the problem to a polygon with ( n ) vertices. 5. **Inductive Hypothesis:** - By the inductive hypothesis, we can 3-color the vertices of the remaining polygon (with ( n ) vertices) such that no two vertices of any triangle in the triangulation have the same color. 6. **Recoloring:** - Now, reintroduce the triangle ( triangle ABC ). Since two vertices ( A ) and ( B ) are already colored and belong to the boundary, color the third vertex ( C ) (which is shared with the polygon boundary). - Because ( A ) and ( B ) are already colored differently (from the inductive hypothesis), assign the remaining third color to vertex ( C ). 7. **Verification:** - Ensure that vertex ( C ) is colored differently from ( A ) and ( B ), and double-check all adjacent triangles to make sure no two adjacent vertices are colored the same. Since each step adheres to the condition of different colors for vertices of each triangle, the coloring is valid. # Conclusion: By induction, the vertices of any polygon triangulated with non-intersecting diagonals can be 3-colored such that all vertices of each triangle are of different colors. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"w many prime numbers are there between 30 and 70 that are greater than 35?","completion":"- Check odd numbers between 36 and 70 because we require primes greater than 35. - The odd candidates in this range are 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69. - Test each candidate for primality, and we find the following primes among them: 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67.

If there's a path along the arrows from a field ( A ) to the hole, we can move the hole to ( A ) by sliding the domino along the path's arrows successively. 5. A path along the arrows either leads to the hole or forms a cycle. We need to prove that dominos forming a cycle enclose a polygon with an odd number of cells inside. 6. Indeed, consider the cycle as a sequence of arrows. If we create a new grid with nodes at the centers of the fields, the cycle will lie along the lines of this grid and enclose a polygon, which this grid divides into squares with sides of length 2. 7. Using induction on the number of squares, show that the initial claim holds. - For one square, it's true: if we place a domino along the boundary, there will be only one cell inside. - A polygon with ( k ) squares is obtained by adding a square along the boundary of a polygon with ( k-1 ) squares. It's easy to check that 2 or 4 cells are added inside by placing dominos along the boundary. 8. Thus, the cycle must enclose a polygon with an odd number of cells inside. This is impossible because such a polygon should be fully filled with dominos, meaning it would contain an even number of cells, contradicting our earlier statement. 9. Therefore, there are no cycles, and there exists a path along the arrows that reaches the hole. 10. Consequently, by moving dominos along the path's arrows, we can shift the hole to any desired corner.

This gives us the equation (36^k - 5^ell = 11). - Testing small values, we find that (k = 1) and (ell = 2) satisfy the equation: (36^1 - 5^2 = 36 - 25 = 11). 8. **Verification**: - We need to verify that there are no smaller positive values. - Since (36^k - 5^ell equiv 1 pmod{10}), the next possible value would be (21), (31), etc., but these do not satisfy the form (36^k - 5^ell) for small values of (k) and (ell).

If ( n ) is even but not divisible by 4, then ( n ) is of the form ( 4k + 2 ). 2. For the sum to be zero and the product to be ( n ), consider how many of the integers must be even. Only one integer can be even because having two even integers would make the product divisible by 4, contradicting our assumption. 3. Now, for the sum: having only one even integer would result in an odd sum as one even integer and ( n-1 ) odd integers sum up to an odd value. Thus, the sum can’t be zero. Therefore, it is also impossible for ( n ) to be even but not divisible by 4 to meet the problem's conditions. --- **Case 3: ( n ) is divisible by 4.** Let ( n = 4m ) where ( m ) is an integer. 3.1 **Sub-case: ( n ) is divisible by 8:** - We need a set of integers whose sum is 0 and whose product is ( n ). - Choose: [ 1 text{ copy of } frac{n}{2}, 1 text{ copy of } 2, left(frac{n}{4} - 2right) text{ copies of } 1, frac{3n}{4} text{ copies of } -1. ] - The sum: [ frac{n}{2} + 2 + left(frac{n}{4} - 2right) times 1 + frac{3n}{4} times (-1) = frac{n}{2} + 2 + frac{n}{4} - 2 - frac{3n}{4} = 0. ] - The product: [ frac{n}{2} times 2 times 1^{frac{n}{4} - 2} times (-1)^{frac{3n}{4}} = frac{n}{2} times 2 times 1 times (-1)^{frac{3n}{4}} = n times (-1)^{text{even number}} = n. ] 3.2 **Sub-case: ( n ) is not divisible by 8 but divisible by 4:** - Choose: [ 1 text{ copy of } frac{n}{2}, 1 text{ copy of } -2, frac{n}{4} text{ copies of } 1, left(frac{3n}{4} - 2right) text{ copies of } -1. ] - The sum: [ frac{n}{2} - 2 + frac{n}{4} times 1 + left(frac{3n}{4} - 2right) times (-1) = frac{n}{2} - 2 + frac{n}{4} - frac{3n}{4} + 2 = 0. ] - The product: [ frac{n}{2} times (-2) times 1^{frac{n}{4}} times (-1)^{frac{3n}{4} - 2} = frac{n}{2} times (-2) times 1 times (-1)^{text{odd number}} = n. ] Hence, both sub-cases under ( n ) divisible by 4 meet the given conditions. # Conclusion Therefore, it is proved that a positive integer ( n ) can have exactly ( n ) integers whose sum is 0 and whose product is ( n ) if and only if ( n ) is divisible by 4.

Let's denote a row, column, or diagonal along which Alex summed the numbers as a \\"line.\\" Notice that there are 20 lines in total, consisting of 5 rows, 5 columns, and 10 diagonals. 2.

The maximum possible sum for any line (when all cells in the line contain the number 7) is: [ 5 times 7 = 35. ] 4. Each possible sum takes the form of sum of five odd numbers, which must be odd.

To find the maximal size of such a set, we consider the subsets of the set ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ). Each integer can be uniquely identified by the subset of digits it contains. Therefore, our task translates to finding the maximal family of subsets of ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) with the following properties: - Each subset corresponds to an integer. - The subsets are intersecting, meaning any two subsets have at least one element in common. - No single element appears in all subsets.

A pair of complementary subsets consists of a subset ( X ) and its complement ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} - X ). Two complementary subsets are non-intersecting, hence in our family of intersecting sets, at most one subset from each pair can be included.

The equality holds if and only if a = b. Since the statement claims the inequality \\"always\\" holds regardless of a and b being equal, this option is incorrect due to its assertion of universality without the condition of a=b. **For option B:** Consider the specific real number a=1.

This satisfies the inequality a+frac{1}{a}leq2, demonstrating that there indeed exists at least one real number (in this case, a=1) for which the inequality holds. Thus, option B is correct. **For option C:** Given a and b are positive real numbers, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{b}, which gives us: frac{frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{b}}{2}geqsqrt{frac{b}{a}cdotfrac{a}{b}} Simplifying the right side, we find: frac{frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{b}}{2}geq1 Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{b}geq2 Thus, option C is correct as it aligns with the AM-GM inequality. **For option D:** Given x+2y=1 for positive real numbers x and y, we analyze the expression frac{2}{x}+frac{1}{y} using the original equation. By multiplying through by the expression (x+2y), we obtain: left(frac{2}{x}+frac{1}{y}right)(x+2y)=frac{4y}{x}+frac{x}{y}+4 Applying the AM-GM inequality to frac{4y}{x}+frac{x}{y}, we find: frac{frac{4y}{x}+frac{x}{y}}{2}geqsqrt{frac{4y}{x}cdotfrac{x}{y}} Simplifying, we get: frac{4y}{x}+frac{x}{y}geq4 Adding 4 to both sides gives us: frac{4y}{x}+frac{x}{y}+4geq8 This shows that the inequality frac{2}{x}+frac{1}{y}geq8 holds under the given condition, making option D correct.

In one-dimensional space, any two non-null vectors (rays) will either point in the same direction or in opposite directions. If they point in opposite directions, they form an angle of ( 180^circ ), which is not acute. Therefore, the largest number of vectors in (mathbb{R}^1) with pairwise non-positive dot products is 2. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume that in ( mathbb{R}^d ), the largest number of non-null vectors with pairwise non-positive dot products is ( 2d ). - Consider ( mathbb{R}^{d+1} ) and let ( u ) be one of the vectors. Denote by ( U = langle u rangle^{perp} ) the orthogonal complement of ( u ), which has dimension ( d ). 3. **Decomposition of Vectors:** - Any vector ( v ) in ( mathbb{R}^{d+1} ) can be uniquely written as ( v = v_{perp} + v_{parallel} ), where ( v_{parallel} = frac{langle u, v rangle}{||u||^2} u ) and ( v_{perp} perp u ), i.e., ( v_{perp} in U ). - The coefficients ( frac{langle u, v rangle}{||u||^2} ) are non-positive under our conditions. Notice that ( v_{perp} = 0 ) can occur only once, for some ( u' = v ) (trivially so, since then ( u' = u'_{parallel} = lambda u ) for some negative real ( lambda )). 4. **Orthogonal Components:** - Consider the orthogonal components ( v_{perp} in U ). We have: [ langle v, w rangle = langle v_{perp} + v_{parallel}, w_{perp} + w_{parallel} rangle = langle v_{perp}, w_{perp} rangle + langle v_{perp}, w_{parallel} rangle + langle v_{parallel}, w_{perp} rangle + langle v_{parallel}, w_{parallel} rangle ] [ = langle v_{perp}, w_{perp} rangle + frac{langle u, v rangle langle u, w rangle}{||u||^2} ] - Therefore, [ langle v_{perp}, w_{perp} rangle = langle v, w rangle - frac{langle u, v rangle langle u, w rangle}{||u||^2} leq 0 ] since ( langle v, w rangle leq 0 ) and ( langle u, v rangle langle u, w rangle geq 0 ). 5. **Induction Hypothesis:** - By the induction hypothesis, the number of non-null vectors in ( U ) is at most ( 2d ). Including ( u ) and possibly ( u' ), there are at most ( 2(d + 1) ) non-null vectors in ( mathbb{R}^{d+1} ). 6. **Model Construction:** - To achieve the bound, we must have the pair ( u ) and ( u' ), with all other vectors orthogonal to them. By inductive reasoning, the only possible model is made by some ( d ) pairwise orthogonal non-null vectors, and some other ( d ) obtained from them by multiplication with arbitrary negative scalars. 7. **Conclusion:** - The largest number of vectors in ( mathbb{R}^d ) with pairwise non-positive dot products is ( 2d ). Therefore, in ( mathbb{R}^3 ), the largest number of such vectors is ( 2 times 3 = 6 ). 8. **Acute Angle Condition:** - To ensure that among any ( n ) rays in space sharing a common origin there exist two which form an acute angle, we need ( n > 6 ). Thus, the least ( n ) is ( 7 ).

For example, if a = 2, b = 3, and c = -1, then ac = -2 and bc = -3, which means ac > bc but a < b. Therefore, without knowing the sign of c, we cannot guarantee that a > b. - Conclusion: Option A is incorrect because it does not hold true when c < 0. **Option B: If a > b, then ac > bc** - This statement seems to imply that multiplying both sides of an inequality by the same number preserves the inequality. However, if c = 0, then ac = bc = 0, regardless of the values of a and b.

These are positions where the player to move will lose if both players play optimally: (2, 5, 11, 23). 2. **Observation of the Pattern:** Notice the pattern in these losing positions. If we denote these positions as (u_n), we can observe that: [ u_1 = 2, quad u_{n+1} = 2u_n + 1. ] This suggests that losing positions are generated by starting from (2) and repeatedly applying the operation ( times 2 + 1 ). 3. **Induction Hypothesis:** We hypothesize that if the initial number of tokens (k) satisfies (u_n leq k < u_{n+1}), then: - (k = u_n) is a losing position, - (k neq u_n) is a winning position. 4. **Base Case:** For (n = 1), we already know (u_1 = 2) is a losing position, and any position within ([3, 4]) is winning as the player can move to (2) (a losing position for the opponent). 5. **Induction Step:** Assuming the hypothesis holds for some (n), we need to show it holds for (n+1). - If (k = u_{n+1} = 2u_n + 1), the first player can remove (1) to (u_n) tokens. Therefore, the resulting tokens will be between (u_n + 1) and (u_{n+1} - 1), all of which are winning positions (by the induction hypothesis). - If (u_{n+1} < k < u_{n+2} = 2u_{n+1} + 1), the first player can remove (k - u_{n+1}) tokens. Here, (k - u_{n+1}) is positive and up to half of (k) because: [ frac{k}{2} leq u_{n+1} implies k leq 2u_{n+1} ] which is always true since (k < 2u_{n+1} + 1).

The numbers ( a_i ) range from ( 1 ) to ( 2n ), and thus the sums ( a_i + i ) must also range over some subset of ( 2 ) to ( 2n + (2n) = 4n ). 7. Since there are ( 2n ) different sums, under our assumption of distinct remainders, there are ( 2n ) distinct remainders among ( 0, 1, ldots, 2n-1 ). 8. Consider ( S = sum_{i=1}^{2n} (a_i + i) ): [ S = sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_i + sum_{i=1}^{2n} i ] 9. The first term, ( sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_i ), is the sum of the first ( 2n ) integers: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_i = frac{(2n)(2n+1)}{2} = n(2n+1) ] 10. The second term, ( sum_{i=1}^{2n} i ), is also known: [ sum_{i=1}^{2n} i = 1 + 2 + ldots + 2n = frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} = n(2n+1) ] 11. Therefore, we have: [ S = n(2n+1) + n(2n+1) = 2n(2n+1) ] 12. According to our assumption, each sum ( a_i + i ) yields a distinct remainder when divided by ( 2n ). Thus, ( S ), the sum of these remainders, must be equivalent to: [ S equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + (2n-1) = frac{(2n-1)2n}{2} = n(2n-1) ] 13. Modulo ( 2n ): [ n(2n-1) equiv 0 pmod{2n} ] 14. But this means ( S = 2n(2n+1) ) which simplifies to: [ 2n times k + n equiv 0 pmod{2n}, quad text{where } k = 2n+1 ] 15. This equation simplifies directly to ( n equiv n pmod{2n} ). 16. This confirms our calculations, but contradicts that each sum ( a_i + i ) could result in a distinct remainder. 17. Hence, among the ( 2n ) sums ( a_1+1, a_2+2, ldots, a_{2n}+2n ), there must be at least two sums having the same remainder when divided by ( 2n ). # Conclusion: **[boxed{text{The proof that two sums must have the same remainder when divided by } 2n text{ is completed.}}]**"},{"prompt":"Given a complex number z=frac{{12i}}{{1+i}} (where i is the imaginary unit), the point corresponding to overline{z} lies in which quadrant?

Let the three numbers in the AP be (n-2), (n), and (n+2). 2. Calculate the sum of their squares: [ (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 ] 3. Evaluate the expression: [ (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 3n^2 + 8 ] 3. The sum of the squares must equal a four-digit number with all digits identical, denoted as (kkkk), where (k) is an integer from 1 to 9. Therefore: [ kkkk = 3n^2 + 8 ] **Solution 1:** 1. To solve (kkk - 8 = 3n^2), note that (kkkk), which equals (k times 1111), must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. This is because: [ kkkk - 8 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] 2.

A sequence of k identical outcomes (either heads or tails) in a row during coin tosses will be referred to as a k-series. We denote the probability of having a k-series in n tosses of a fair coin as p_{n, k}. 2. Next, we count all possible k-series of length n (where n geq k) that start with a head. We denote this number as A_{n, k}, noting that if n < k, then A_{n, k}=0. 3. By symmetry, the number of k-series starting with tails is also A_{n, k}. 4. Let’s analyze the structure of k-series that start with heads and end with both heads and tails. - A k-series of length n, beginning with heads, can be of the form HRT* if the first head is followed by one or more tails and then heads. The number of such k-series is equal to the number of k-series of length n-1 starting with a tail, i.e., A_{n-1, k}. - Extending this idea further, k-series of the form HHT*, HHHT*, ..., ending with a tail can be counted similarly. For the general form Hunderbrace{HH...H}_{i}T*, there are A_{n-i-1, k} such series for 1 leq i < k. - Finally, the number of k-series of the form underbrace{HH...H}_{k}ast where the first k flips are heads is given by 2^{n-k}, as there are 2^{n-k} ways to arrange the remaining flips. 5.

Substituting this result back into our initial combined recurrence relation, we get: [ A_{n, k} = A_{n-1, k} + (A_{n-1, k} - A_{n-k, k} - 2^{n-1-k}) + 2^{n-k} ] Simplifying, we have: [ A_{n, k} = 2A_{n-1, k} - A_{n-k, k} + 2^{n-1-k} ] 8.

Set #1 has 2 vowels (a, e) and 3 consonants (b, c, d). Set #2 has 2 vowels (o) and 4 consonants (k, l, m, n, p).

The train's speed is given as 60 kmph. To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s. So, the train's speed in m/s is: 60 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 16.67 m/s The train takes 15 seconds to pass the man, and the length of the train is 275 meters. The distance covered by the train while passing the man is equal to the length of the train, which is 275 meters. Since the train and the man are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. We can use the formula for relative speed (distance/time) to find the relative speed: Relative speed = Distance / Time Relative speed = 275 meters / 15 seconds Relative speed = 18.33 m/s Now we have the relative speed in m/s, but we need to find the man's speed in kmph. First, we'll find the man's speed in m/s by subtracting the train's speed from the relative speed: Man's speed in m/s = Relative speed - Train's speed Man's speed in m/s = 18.33 m/s - 16.67 m/s Man's speed in m/s = 1.66 m/s Finally, we convert the man's speed from m/s to kmph using the conversion factor: Man's speed in kmph = Man's speed in m/s * (3600 s / 1000 m) Man's speed in kmph = 1.66 m/s * (3600 s / 1000 m) Man's speed in kmph = 5.976 kmph Rounding to two decimal places, the man's speed is approximately boxed{5.98} kmph."},{"prompt":"A mixture of milk and water contains milk and water in the ratio 3 : 2.

(A) cannot move at (2) anymore. - Strategy for (B): Whenever (A) makes a move at (k ge 3), (B) makes a move at (k-1). - If (B) cannot make a move at (k-1), it must be because (k-1) is consecutive to some moves by (B).

According to the problem, the amount after 2 years is Rs. 8000, and after 3 years it is Rs. 9261. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) where: A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest. P = the principal amount (the initial sum of money) r = the annual interest rate (in decimal) n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year t = the time the money is invested for, in years Since we don't know the rate and it's compounded annually, we can assume n = 1. So the formula simplifies to: A = P(1 + r)^t For the amount after 2 years (t = 2), we have: 8000 = P(1 + r)^2 ... (1) For the amount after 3 years (t = 3), we have: 9261 = P(1 + r)^3 ... (2) We can solve these two equations to find P and r.

After the replacement, the total volume of the solution remains V liters, but the amount of sugar in the solution is now the sum of the sugar remaining from the first solution and the sugar from the second solution. The new concentration is 20% sugar by weight, so the total amount of sugar in the solution is now 0.2V kg. The amount of sugar from the first solution that remains after x liters are removed is 0.1(V - x) kg, because we removed x liters of the first solution which had 10% sugar.

Hence, the expression becomes: [ frac{x^n(y-z) + y^n(z-x) + z^n(x-y)}{(x-y)(x-z)(y-z)} ] 2. **Special Case when ( n = 0 ):** For ( n = 0 ): [ frac{(y-z) + (z-x) + (x-y)}{(x-y)(x-z)(y-z)} = frac{0}{(x-y)(x-z)(y-z)} = 0 ] which is clearly an integer. 3. **Consider the Numerator for General ( n ):** We need to prove that the numerator ( x^n(y-z) + y^n(z-x) + z^n(x-y) ) is divisible by the denominator ((x-y)(x-z)(y-z)). 4. **Express the Numerator Differently:** First observe the polynomial identity: [ x - y = -(y - z) - (z - x). ] Using similar identities, the numerator can be expressed as: [ (x^n - z^n)(y-z) + (y^n - z^n)(z-x). ] This helps in reducing the problem. For example, for ( n = 1 ): [ (x - z)(y-z) + (y - z)(z-x) = 0. ] 5. **Factor the Remaining Terms:** For ( n geq 2 ): begin{align*} (x^n - z^n)(y-z) + (y^n - z^n)(z-x) &= (x-z)(y-z) left[x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}z + cdots + z^{n-1} - y^{n-1} - y^{n-2}z - cdots - z^{n-1} right] &= (x-y)(x-z)(y-z) left[x^{n-2} + x^{n-3}y + cdots + y^{n-2} + cdots right]. end{align*} Here the term in square brackets is a polynomial with integer coefficients in ( x, y, z ). 6. **Extracting the Polynomial in Terms of ( x, y, z ):** The expression inside the square brackets, given ( x, y, z ) are integers, results in an integer polynomial. ( (x-y)(x-z)(y-z) ) is clearly cancelled from the numerator and denominator. # Conclusion Thus, for the numerator ( x^n(y-z) + y^n(z-x) + z^n(x-y) ) being polynomial with integer coefficients, the fraction simplifies into an integer. Therefore, [ frac{x^n}{(x-y)(x-z)} + frac{y^n}{(y-x)(y-z)} + frac{z^n}{(z-x)(z-y)} ] is always an integer.

Let's begin by analyzing the problem for the case when ( n = 2 ). For this, the equilateral triangle ( triangle ABC ) is divided into smaller equilateral triangles. Let ( x, y, z ) be the values placed on the midpoints of sides ( BC, CA, AB ) respectively. 2. Given the conditions: [ b + y = x + z, quad c + z = x + y, quad a + x = y + z ] 3.

For various cases: * **Case (i):** If ( a, b, c ) are distinct, the maximum and minimum values will be at the vertices ( A, B, C ) respectively because any intermediary values are averages of these.

Then ( mathrm{Area}(C cap T) ) is greater than ( frac{1}{2} mathrm{Area}(C) ). Without loss of generality, assume ( x ) is outside of ( [-20, 20]^2 ). Since the area of ( C cap T ) is non-empty, there is a point ( P ) in ( T ) such that the distance between ( x ) and ( P ) is at least 19. Therefore, at least one of the sides of the triangle has length at least 19. Let ( h ) be the height of the altitude onto this side. Note that ( T ) is contained in an infinite rectangular strip of width ( h ), so the area of ( C cap T ) is at most the area of the intersection of ( C ) with this strip, which is at most ( 2h ). But the area of ( T ) is at least ( frac{19h}{2} ), so: [ f(x, y, z) geq frac{pi}{2} + frac{1}{3} cdot frac{19h}{2} - 2h = frac{pi}{2} + frac{7}{6} h geq 0 ] as claimed. (blacksquare) 4. **Claim 2**: If there is a point inside ( ((-30, 30)^2)^3 ) for which ( f ) is negative, then there exists a local minima of ( f ) which is negative. - **Proof**: Let ( R = ([-30, 30]^2)^3 ). Since ( R ) is compact, and since ( f ) is continuous, ( f ) must achieve its minimum in ( R ). If ( f ) is not ( geq 0 ) in ( R ), then its minimum is less than 0, so it can't achieve its minimum on the boundary, since we proved that ( f ) is ( geq 0 ) outside of ( ([-20, 20]^2)^3 ). So any point that achieves the minimum in ( R ) will be a local minima of ( f ) on ( (mathbb{R}^2)^3 ). (blacksquare) 5. **Claim 3**: If ( f ) achieves a local minima at ( (x, y, z) ), then the unit circle intersects each side of ( T ) twice in such a way that it splits each side of ( T ) into three equal pieces. - **Proof**: Suppose the interior of ( C ) doesn't intersect the side ( xy ) of ( T ). Then consider perturbing ( x ) a distance ( varepsilon ) directly towards ( z ). The area of ( T ) will decrease by ( O(varepsilon) ) and the area of ( A ) will increase by at most ( O(varepsilon^{3/2}) ). So overall ( f ) will decrease by ( O(varepsilon) ), so this can't be a local minimum. Now suppose ( xy ) passes through the interior of ( C ), and suppose that ( [a, b] subset [0, 1] ) is the largest range such that ( x + lambda (y - x) ) is contained in ( C ) for all ( lambda in [a, b] ). Suppose we perturb ( x ) a distance ( varepsilon ) towards ( z ) (we consider negative values of ( varepsilon ) too). Then the overall change in ( f ) is: [ O(varepsilon (1/3 - (b^2 - a^2))) + O(varepsilon^2) ] Therefore in order to have a local minimum we must have ( b^2 = a^2 + 1/3 ). Similarly by considering perturbing ( y ), we get the overall change in ( g ) being: [ O(varepsilon (1/3 - ((1 - a)^2 - (1 - b)^2))) + O(varepsilon^2) ] and hence we must have ( (1 - a)^2 = (1 - b)^2 + 1/3 ). Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get ( a = frac{1}{3} ) and ( b = frac{2}{3} ), which proves the claim. (blacksquare) 6. **Conclusion**: Now suppose we have a triangle ( T ) such that ( C ) intersects it in the way described above. Suppose ( C ) intersects side ( xy ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). Note that the perpendicular bisectors of ( AB ) and ( xy ) are the same, and the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) passes through the center of ( C ), so the perpendicular bisectors of each side of ( T ) pass through the center of ( C ). So ( C ) is centered on the circumcenter of ( T ). Let ( O ) be the center of ( C ). Let ( d ) be the distance between ( O ) and ( xy ). Let ( l ) be half the length of ( AB ). Then by Pythagoras, the radius of ( C ) is ( sqrt{l^2 + d^2} ), and the circumradius of ( T ) is ( sqrt{9l^2 + d^2} ). Note that the ratio of these two values is a monotonic function of ( l / d ). We can repeat the calculation for each side, and since the ratio is a fixed quantity in terms of known radii, we must get the same value each time. So the value of ( l / d ) is the same for each side. Plugging this into the fact that ( sqrt{l^2 + d^2} ) must be the same for each side, we get that the value of ( l ) is the same for each side, so ( T ) is equilateral. At this point we know exactly what the diagram must look like for there to be a local minimum: the triangle must be equilateral, the circle must be centered at the center of the triangle, and the radius of the circle must be such that it intersects the sides of the triangle in a way that splits the sides into 3 equal pieces. It is a simple exercise to check that the value of ( f ) is exactly 0 in this case. Now using this and using the claims, we deduce that ( f ) is non-negative everywhere, and is 0 precisely when the situation described above happens."},{"prompt":"The negation of the proposition For x in mathbb{R}, x leq 1 or x^2 > 4 is.","completion":"The negation of an \\"existential proposition\\" must be a \\"universal proposition\\".

We are to show that for any three such lines a, b, and c, the circumcircle of the triangle formed by their intersection points passes through the midpoint M of the segment left[O_{1} O_{2}right].

For any point P on the plane, denote P_{A}, P_{B}, P_{C} the orthogonal projections of P onto the lines (BC), (CA), and (AB) respectively. Then P_{A}, P_{B}, P_{C} are collinear if and only if P in Gamma.

It's suggested from intuition that Delta does not depend on the specific choice of a, b, or c. Therefore, it’s sufficient to prove the existence of such a line Delta for any equitable line d, with the orthogonal projection of M onto d lying on Delta. 3. **Radical Axis of Circles Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2}**: Our aim is to show that the radical axis of Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2} functions as Delta. 4. **Orthogonal Projections**: Consider an equitable line d and let M' be the orthogonal projection of M onto d.

Thus, there is a radical axis Delta such that the orthogonal projection of M on any equitable line d lies on this Delta.

Divide the triangle into the minimum number of acuteangled triangles.","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem**: We have to divide an isosceles triangle with an angle of 108^circ between its equal sides into the minimum number of acute-angled triangles. 2. **Relating the triangle to a regular pentagon**: A triangle with an internal angle of 108^circ between its equal sides can be related to a regular pentagon because each internal angle of a regular pentagon is exactly 108^circ. 3. **Formulate the regular pentagon**: Consider a regular pentagon and extend one of its sides to form a triangle that has the desired internal angle of 108^circ. This triangle will be similar to the triangle mentioned in the problem. 4. **Join vertices of the pentagon to the center**: By joining each vertex of the pentagon to its center, we divide the pentagon into 5 smaller isosceles triangles. Each of these internal triangles has their base angles of frac{180^circ - 108^circ}{2} = 36^circ and the remaining angle of 108^circ. 5. **Dividing into acute-angled triangles**: When any internal angles are greater than 90^circ, we need to ensure that all smaller triangles formed are acute-angled. Note that degrees higher than 90^circ need additional sub-divisions to convert them into acute angles. 6. **Counting the acute-angled triangles**: If we connect the center of the pentagon to one of the sides to form triangles within the structure of the pentagon, we actually create 7 acute-angled triangles in total. 7. **Proving the minimum number**: Let's assume for contradiction that we can divide the triangle into fewer than 7 acute-angled triangles. We choose such a sub-division with the least number of triangles. In any such division, if a line segment starts from the acute or obtuse angle vertices, it will either not reach the opposite side or subdivide into a non-acute angle, contradicting our assumptions. 8. **Verifying our construction**: For any attempt to use fewer triangles, it would mean some segments intersect in inner points forming additional vertices inevitably making their internal angles acute. This ensures our assumption about a lesser number of acute-angled triangles was incorrect. 9. **Using properties of angles**: This regular pattern within a pentagon thus guarantees that the configuration made has the least number of internal divisions necessary, as each adjoining interior angle to an internal division would otherwise create unwanted obtuse angles. # Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of acute-angled triangles needed to subdivide the given isosceles triangle, considering the properties of geometric shapes and angles, is 7.

To demonstrate this, consider any triangle with a base ( a ) and an angle ( alpha ) at the opposite vertex. The set of such triangles' vertices forms an arc segment centered at the base endpoints. 3. **Maximizing Quadrilateral Area:** The area of the quadrilateral ( K M N P ) is the sum or difference of the areas of the triangles ( K M P ) and ( M N P ). If point ( N ) is moved so that the vertices ( M ) and ( P ) slide along the sides of the angle, the area of ( triangle M N P ) remains constant. The quadrilateral ( K M N P ) will have maximum area when ( triangle K M P ) has maximum area, which occurs when ( triangle K M P ) is isosceles, i.e., ( K M = K P ).

Subtracting 42 from 28 gives us: -14 Now we have the simplified expression: Some number - (-14) = 59 Subtracting a negative is the same as adding, so this becomes: Some number + 14 = 59 To find the number, we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation: Some number = 59 - 14 Some number = 45 Therefore, the number is boxed{45} ."},{"prompt":"During summer break, 907611 kids from Lawrence county stay home and the other kids go to camp.

The eccentricity e is given by e= frac{c}{a}= sqrt{1- frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}}= frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Solving this equation gives a=2.
