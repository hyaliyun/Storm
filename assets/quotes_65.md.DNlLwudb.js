We need to analyze whether the following claims by the professor are true or false based on the given axioms: (C1) The operation \`*\` is commutative: x * y = y * x for all x, y in mathbb{Z}. (C2) The operation \`*\` is associative: (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) for all x, y, z in mathbb{Z}. Let's go through each claim step-by-step. Analyzing (C1) Commutativity: We need to determine whether x * y = y * x holds. To do so, we start by formulating the given axioms using a new notation, as follows: 1. If (x * y) = z, then replace x * y with z in the axioms: (a) x * z = y, i.e., x * (x * y) = y becomes x * (x * y) = y (already in this form). (b) z * y = x, i.e., (x * y) * y = x becomes (x * y) * y = x (already in this form). Given: (x * y) = z implies x * (x * y) = y. To prove: x * y = y * x. Let's follow the sequence of transformations based on the given axioms: 1. Suppose (x * y) = z, so we have both x * (x * y) = y and (x * y) * y = x. 2. Therefore, (x * y) * y = x, and reassign each to (z * y = x). 3. Next, apply (x * (x * y) = y) and reassign each to (x * z = y). Using both transformations: - (x * y) = z rightarrow z = (x * y), - (z * x) = y rightarrow (y * x) = z. Given (x * y) rightarrow (x * y = z) rightarrow (z * x) = y rightarrow (y * x) = z. Now conclude: x * y = (z equiv y * x). Thus by (x * y = y * x), the operation \`*\` is confirmed to be commutative. Analyzing (C2) Associativity: We need to check whether (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) holds. # Counterexample for (C2): Let's take a specific example: Define x * y = -(x + y). Validate the claims: - (x * y) = -(x + y). Now evaluate using specific integers scenarios: - (x = 1, y = 2, z = 3): - (1 * 2) * 3 = (-(1 + 2)) * 3 = -3 * 3, - 1 * (2 * 3) = 1 * (-(2 + 3)) = 1 * -5 = -(1 - 5). In this proof, observe: - (x * y) = (-3 * 3) = -6 - 1 * (-5) = -6 proves not generally (x * y) * z = x * ( y * z) meaning **not** associative.

To isolate the desired sum ( C_{n}^{1} + C_{n}^{4} + C_{n}^{7} + cdots + C_{n}^{3m+1} ), we perform the following operations.

However, we have an overcount; when we were counting the arrangements for non-adjacent A and B, we included the cases where A and B could have been adjacent. To correct for this, we need to subtract the overcounted arrangements from the first case. The overcount is exactly the number of adjacent arrangements, which is 24. So the correct number of arrangements for non-adjacent A and B is 48 - 24 = 24. Adding the number of arrangements for non-adjacent and adjacent cases, we get 24 + 24 = 48 different arrangements.

If the food is enough to feed 1000 cows for 50 days, then the total amount of food can be represented as: Total food = Number of cows * Number of days Total food = 1000 cows * 50 days Total food = 50,000 cow-days This means the farmer has enough food to feed 1000 cows for 50 days, or equivalently, 50,000 cow-days of food. After 10 days of feeding 1000 cows, the amount of food consumed would be: Food consumed in 10 days = Number of cows * Number of days Food consumed in 10 days = 1000 cows * 10 days Food consumed in 10 days = 10,000 cow-days So, the remaining food after 10 days is: Remaining food = Total food - Food consumed in 10 days Remaining food = 50,000 cow-days - 10,000 cow-days Remaining food = 40,000 cow-days Now, this remaining food is supposed to last for the original period of 50 days, but with fewer cows since some ran away. Let's call the number of cows that ran away \\"x.\\" Therefore, the number of cows remaining is 1000 - x. Since the remaining food is enough to feed the remaining cows for 50 days, we can set up the following equation: Remaining food = (Number of remaining cows) * (Number of days) 40,000 cow-days = (1000 - x) cows * 50 days Now, we can solve for x: 40,000 = (1000 - x) * 50 40,000 = 50,000 - 50x 50x = 50,000 - 40,000 50x = 10,000 x = 10,000 / 50 x = 200 So, boxed{200} cows ran away."},{"prompt":"To determine the vitamin content of two varieties of strawberries, researchers selected 7 plants from each of the two varieties, measured the vitamin content per 100 grams of strawberries (unit: milligrams) in each plant.

Show that there exists a (2 times 2) square containing an odd number of white cells. 1. **Notation and Setup**: - Let's represent each cell in the (200 times 200) grid by a coordinate ((r, s)), where (1 leq r leq 200) represents the row number and (1 leq s leq 200) represents the column number. - Suppose the top-left cell of a (2 times 2) square is at ((i, j)), and the square contains some arrangement of black and white cells. 2. **Contradiction Hypothesis**: - Assume, for contradiction, that every (2 times 2) square in the grid contains an even number of white cells. - Consequently, each (2 times 2) square must contain either 0, 2, or 4 white cells (since these are the only even counts possible from four cells). 3. **First Row Analysis**: - Let (b_1) be the number of black cells and (w_1) be the number of white cells in the first row. Since there are 200 cells in each row, we have: [ b_1 + w_1 = 200 ] - Given that the difference between the number of black and white cells overall is 404, let (b_1 - w_1 = d_1), where (d_1) is some integer. This means the absolute value (d_1 = 2m) must be even and no greater than 200. 4. **Subsequent Rows Analysis**: - Consider the (i)-th row where the leftmost cell at ((i, k)) might be of same color as the cell directly above it at ((i-1, k)) or different. - Continue this argument across the entire grid to deduce the pattern of white and black cells across all rows. Let's define (x) as the number of rows that have the same color pattern as the first row, and (y) be the number of rows with opposite color pattern. We must have: [ x + y = 200 ] - Let (d_2 = |x-y|), which must be an even number and at most 200. Hence, we have (d_2 = 2n). 5. **Absolute Difference and Conclusion**: - We know the absolute difference in the number of black and white cells for the entire grid is given by: [ |b - w| = |b_1 - w_1| cdot |x - y| = 404 ] - Substituting in (2m) and (2n) gives: [ 4mn = 404 implies mn = 101 ] 6. **Impossibility**: - (m) and (n) are integers that must satisfy (2m leq 200) and (2n leq 200), implying (m leq 100) and (n leq 100). - However, (mn = 101) must hold, but since 101 is a prime number, the only integer solution is (m = 1) and (n = 101) or (m = 101) and (n = 1), making one of them must exceed 100, which is a contradiction. Thus, our original hypothesis that every (2 times 2) square contains an even number of white cells must be false.

These are the perpendicular distances from (O) to the sides of the triangle. 3. **Known Formula for the Area of a Triangle:** The area (S) of triangle (ABC) can be expressed in terms of its sides and distances from an internal point to the sides: [ S = frac{1}{2} a d_a + frac{1}{2} b d_b + frac{1}{2} c d_c ] Combining these: [ a d_a + b d_b + c d_c = 2S ] 4. **Relationship Between Heights and Area:** The heights (h_a, h_b, h_c) from vertices (A, B, C) to their opposite sides (BC, CA, AB) are given by: [ a h_a = b h_b = c h_c = 2S ] 5. **Difference of Heights and Distances:** Given (AA_1 = BB_1 = CC_1), let's introduce (x) such that: [ h_a - d_a = h_b - d_b = h_c - d_c = x ] 6. **Formulating Equations with (x):** The expression involving (x) can be written as: [ (a+b+c) x = a(h_a - d_a) + b(h_b - d_b) + c(h_c - d_c) ] Substituting the equal heights: [ (a+b+c)x = a(h_a - d_a) + b(h_b - d_b) + c(h_c - d_c) = a h_a + b h_b + c h_c - (a d_a + b d_b + c d_c) ] 7. **Substitutions and Simplifications:** Since (a h_a = b h_b = c h_c = 2S): [ a h_a + b h_b + c h_c = 6S ] And we know: [ a d_a + b d_b + c d_c = 2S ] Substituting these into the equation: [ (a+b+c)x = 6S - 2S = 4S ] 8. **Solving for (x):** Recall the semi-perimeter (p) of the triangle: [ p = frac{a+b+c}{2} ] Therefore: [ (a+b+c)x = 4S ] Dividing both sides by (a + b + c): [ x = frac{4S}{a+b+c} = frac{4S}{2p} = frac{2S}{p} = 2r ] 9. **Conclusion:** Hence, the equal distances (AA_1 = BB_1 = CC_1) are indeed equal to (2r).

The Rational Root Theorem suggests that rational roots have the form frac{p}{q}, where p is a factor of the constant term (48 in this case), and q is a factor of the leading coefficient (8). The factors for 48 are pm 1, pm 2, pm 3, pm 4, pm 6, pm 8, pm 12, pm 16, pm 24, pm 48, and the factors of 8 are pm 1, pm 2, pm 4, pm 8.

To understand the behavior of f(x), we differentiate it to get its first derivative: f'(x) = e^x - x - 1. **Step 2: Defining p(x) = e^x - x - 1 and Analyzing Its Derivative** We then consider p(x) = e^x - x - 1 to further analyze the behavior of f(x). The derivative of p(x) is: p'(x) = e^x - 1. By examining p'(x), we can determine the intervals where p(x) is increasing or decreasing: - For x < 0, p'(x) < 0, indicating that p(x) is decreasing. - For x > 0, p'(x) > 0, indicating that p(x) is increasing. Since p(0) = 0 and p(x) increases for x > 0, we conclude that p(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, with equality only when x = 0.

Now, consider the expression ( (a circ b) circ c ): [ (a circ b) circ c = phi(phi(a) cdot phi(b)) circ phi(c) = phi(phi(a) cdot phi(b) cdot phi(c)) ] Since ( phi(phi(a)) = a ), we have: [ (a circ b) circ c = phi(phi(a) cdot phi(b) cdot phi(c)) = 1 - (1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) ] 5. Simplify the expression: [ (a circ b) circ c = 1 - (1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c) = 1 - (1 - a - b + ab)(1 - c) = 1 - (1 - a - b + ab - c + ac + bc - abc) ] [ = a + b + c - ab - ac - bc + abc ] 6. Given the problem's condition: [ (x circ y) circ z + (y circ z) circ x + (z circ x) circ y = 0 ] Using the simplified form: [ (x circ y) circ z = (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) + 1 ] Similarly: [ (y circ z) circ x = (y-1)(z-1)(x-1) + 1 ] [ (z circ x) circ y = (z-1)(x-1)(y-1) + 1 ] 7. Summing these expressions: [ (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) + 1 + (y-1)(z-1)(x-1) + 1 + (z-1)(x-1)(y-1) + 1 = 0 ] [ 3((x-1)(y-1)(z-1)) + 3 = 0 ] [ 3((x-1)(y-1)(z-1) + 1) = 0 ] [ (x-1)(y-1)(z-1) = -1 ] 8. We need three integers whose product is (-1). The integers must be either (1) or (-1), and the number of (-1)'s must be odd. The possible combinations are: - One (-1) and two (1)'s: ((x-1, y-1, z-1) = (-1, 1, 1)) or permutations. - Three (-1)'s: ((x-1, y-1, z-1) = (-1, -1, -1)). 9. Solving for (x, y, z): - For ((x-1, y-1, z-1) = (-1, 1, 1)), we get ((x, y, z) = (0, 2, 2)) and permutations. - For ((x-1, y-1, z-1) = (-1, -1, -1)), we get ((x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0)). Conclusion: The only possible triples ((x, y, z)) are: [ (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0), (0, 2, 2), (2, 0, 2), (2, 2, 0) ] The final answer is ( boxed{ (0, 0, 0), (0, 2, 2), (2, 0, 2), (2, 2, 0) } )."},{"prompt":"batsman in his 12 th innings makes a score of 65 and thereby increases his average by 3 runs . what is his average after the 12 th innings if he had never been ‘ not out ’ ?","completion":"Let's assume the batsman's average after 11 innings was A. This means the total runs scored by the batsman in 11 innings would be 11A. After the 12th innings, where he scored 65 runs, his average increased by 3 runs. So his new average after the 12th innings is A + 3. The total runs after 12 innings would be the previous total plus the 65 runs scored in the 12th innings, which is 11A + 65. Since the new average after the 12th innings is A + 3, the total runs can also be calculated by multiplying the new average by the number of innings, which gives us 12(A + 3). Now we can set up the equation: 11A + 65 = 12(A + 3) Expanding both sides of the equation: 11A + 65 = 12A + 36 Now, let's isolate A: 65 - 36 = 12A - 11A 29 = A So the batsman's average after 11 innings was 29 runs.

The key to solving this problem lies in mastering the concepts of necessary conditions, sufficient conditions, and necessary and sufficient conditions. Let's break it down step by step: 1.

Paul had £20 for his shopping. How much money did Paul have left after buying all these items?","completion":"First, let's calculate the discounted prices for the butter and the cookies. The butter has a 10% discount on its original price of £3: 10% of £3 = 0.10 * £3 = £0.30 Discounted price of butter = £3 - £0.30 = £2.70 The cookies have a 20% discount on their original price of £4: 20% of £4 = 0.20 * £4 = £0.80 Discounted price of cookies = £4 - £0.80 = £3.20 Now, let's calculate the price of the juice, which is two times the price of the bread: Price of juice = 2 * £2 = £4 Now we can calculate the total cost of the items before VAT: Total cost before VAT = Price of bread + Discounted price of butter + Price of juice + Discounted price of cookies Total cost before VAT = £2 + £2.70 + £4 + £3.20 Total cost before VAT = £11.90 Now we need to calculate the VAT on the total cost: 5% VAT of £11.90 = 0.05 * £11.90 = £0.595 Since we can't have a fraction of a penny, we'll round the VAT to the nearest penny: VAT = £0.60 Now let's calculate the total cost including VAT: Total cost including VAT = Total cost before VAT + VAT Total cost including VAT = £11.90 + £0.60 Total cost including VAT = £12.50 Finally, let's calculate how much money Paul has left after his shopping: Money left = Initial amount - Total cost including VAT Money left = £20 - £12.50 Money left = £7.50 Paul has boxed{£7.50} left after buying all the items."},{"prompt":"a tennis tournament, (2^n + 4) schoolchildren are participating, where (n) is a natural number greater than 4.

Let ( 2^n + 4 ) be the number of participants in the tennis tournament, where ( n ) is a natural number greater than 4. 2. To determine how many participants score 3 points each, we need to define two major claims and prove them. 3. **Claim 1:** In a tournament with ( 2^n ) participants, no player is left without a pair. At the end of the tournament, there will be ( C_{n}^{k} ) participants with ( k ) points for each ( k in {0, 1, ldots, n-1, n} ). - **Proof by induction on ( n ):** - **Base case ( n=1 ):** With ( n=1 ), we have ( 2^1 = 2 ) participants. The outcomes are straightforward: one player wins (1 point), one loses (0 points). Hence, ( C_1^0 = 1 ) and ( C_1^1 = 1 ). - **Inductive step:** Assume the claim is true for some ( n ). Consider a tournament with ( 2^{n+1} ) participants. - Group them into ( 2^n ) participants each with 0 points and 1 point after the first round. - Apply the inductive hypothesis: in each group, participants will have ( C_{n}^{k} ) with ( k ) points. - By the binomial theorem and Pascal's triangle, for the ( 2^{n+1} ) participants, we get ( C_{n+1}^{k} = C_{n}^{k} + C_{n}^{k-1} ). Thus, every score distribution follows Pascal's triangle. Therefore, the first claim holds. 4. **Claim 2:** The tournament can be divided into two independent tournaments within groups of ( 2^n ) and 4 participants respectively. - **Proof:** We conduct the tournament as follows: - In each round, pair up players only within their group. - For the group of ( 2^n ), ensure no participant is left unpaired. - In the final stage, if there are any participants without a pair, they must belong to the group of 4 participants. Hence, at the end, the results from two groups combine, creating a single leaderboard. 5. **Conclusion:** - In the group of ( 2^n ), from Claim 1, there are ( C_{n}^{3} ) participants with 3 points. - In the group of 4 participants, by direct enumeration (tracking with dynamic pairs and outcomes), eventually exactly one participant will end with 3 points. 6.

Since a_n=b_n+b_{n+1}, it follows that a_{n-1}=b_{n-1}+b_n, and consequently, a_n-a_{n-1}=b_{n+1}-b_{n-1}. This implies that 2d=6, and hence, d=3.

The smallest possible values that satisfy (a > b > c > d > 0) and (ad = bc) are (a = 4, b = 3, c = 2, d = 1). 10. For these values, we have: [ (4 - 1)^2 = 3^2 = 9 ] and [ 4d + 8 = 4(1) + 8 = 12 ] 11. Clearly, (9 ge 12) is false, so we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the general case again. 12. Since (a > b > c > d > 0), we can assume (a = kd) for some integer (k > 1). Then: [ kd cdot d = bc implies k = frac{bc}{d^2} ] 13. We need to show that: [ (kd - d)^2 ge 4d + 8 ] Simplify: [ (d(k - 1))^2 ge 4d + 8 ] [ d^2(k - 1)^2 ge 4d + 8 ] 14. Divide both sides by (d): [ d(k - 1)^2 ge 4 + frac{8}{d} ] 15. Since (d > 0), (frac{8}{d}) is positive and decreases as (d) increases. For (d ge 1), (frac{8}{d} le 8). 16. Therefore, we need: [ d(k - 1)^2 ge 4 + 8 = 12 ] 17. For (d ge 1), (k - 1) must be sufficiently large to satisfy the inequality. Since (k > 1), (k - 1 ge 1). 18. Thus, the inequality holds for sufficiently large (a, b, c,) and (d) such that (a > b > c > d > 0) and (ad = bc).

We will use mathematical induction to demonstrate this. 1. **Base Case (( m = 2 )):** For ( m = 2 ) (i.e., the array has 2 rows), since the two rows are different, they must differ in at least one column. Let ( C ) be the column where the rows differ. Therefore, removing any column other than ( C ) ensures that the two rows are still different in the remaining columns. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that the statement is true for ( m lt n ); that is, for any ( k times n ) array where ( k leq m ), there exists a set ( C ) of fewer than ( m ) columns such that all ( k ) rows are still distinguishable in the subset of columns in ( C ). 3. **Induction Step:** Now, consider the case where ( m = k + 1 ). We need to show that there exists a set ( C ) of fewer than ( k + 1 ) columns that can distinguish all ( k + 1 ) rows. Since the hypothesis holds for ( m leq k ), we have a set ( C ) of fewer than ( k ) columns which distinguish the first ( k ) rows. If set ( C ) also distinguishes row ( k+1 ) from all previous ( k ) rows, then we are done. Otherwise, row ( k+1 ) must match one of the previous ( k ) rows on all columns in ( C ). 4. **Adding a Distinguishing Column:** As row ( k+1 ) cannot be identical to any of the previous rows across all ( n ) columns, there must be some column where row ( k+1 ) differs from the row it matches within set ( C ). Let this column be ( c' ). Add column ( c' ) to ( C ). This ensures that the new set ( C' ) (which is ( C cup {c'} )) now contains fewer than ( k + 1 ) columns and distinguishes row ( k+1 ) from all previous rows. 5. **Conclusion:** By induction, the result holds for all ( m leq n ). This means for our ( n times n ) array, we can always find a set ( C ) of fewer than ( n ) columns that can distinguish all ( n ) rows. Since this set is fewer than ( n ) columns, it leaves at least one column that can be removed without making any two rows identical. Therefore, it is possible to remove one column from the ( n times n ) array to obtain an ( n times (n-1) ) array with no two identical rows.

The formula for combinations is nCk = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, k is the number of items to choose, and ! denotes factorial. So, the number of ways to select 2 boys out of B is: BC2 = B! / (2!(B-2)!) = B(B-1) / 2 The total number of ways to select 1 girl and 2 boys is the product of the two combinations: 10C1 * BC2 = 10 * (B(B-1) / 2) We are given that there are 780 ways to select 1 girl and 2 boys: 10 * (B(B-1) / 2) = 780 Simplify the equation: B(B-1) / 2 = 78 B(B-1) = 156 Now we have a quadratic equation in terms of B: B^2 - B - 156 = 0 We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first: (B - 13)(B + 12) = 0 This gives us two possible solutions for B: B = 13 or B = -12. Since the number of boys cannot be negative, we discard B = -12.

Therefore, f(x) must be monotonically increasing in its domain. This means f(x) is an increasing function on both intervals defined by its piecewise components. 1. When x geq 0, f(x) = ax^2 + 1. For the function to be increasing, the coefficient of x^2 must be positive, hence a > 0. 2. When x < 0, f(x) = (a^2-1)e^{ax}. For the function to be increasing, we have two cases: - If a > 0, then a^2 - 1 > 0. - If a < 0, then a^2 - 1 < 0 — however, this case can be discarded as it contradicts the earlier observation from interval x geq 0 where we determined a > 0. Combining these two conditions, we find that a > 1. Furthermore, we need the right-hand limit as x approaches 0 to be greater than or equal to the left-hand limit as x approaches 0, i.e., lim_{x to 0^+} f(x) geq lim_{x to 0^-} f(x), this translates to the inequality 1 geq a^2 - 1, which gives us a leq sqrt{2}.

Find the smallest interesting number.","completion":"1. Let's factorize the natural number ( n ) into its prime factors. To ensure that ( 2n ) is a perfect square, all prime numbers in the factorization of ( 2n ) must appear to an even exponent. 2. Similarly, for ( 15n ) to be a perfect cube, all prime numbers in the factorization of ( 15n ) must appear to a multiple of three exponent. 3. Examine the factor of 2: - Since ( 2n ) is a perfect square, the power of 2 in ( n ) must be odd, because ( 2 times text{(odd power of 2)} = 2^{text{even}} ). - Since ( 15n ) is a perfect cube, the power of 2 in ( n ) must be a multiple of 3. - Hence, the smallest odd multiple of 3 is 3. 4. Next, examine the factor of 3: - Since ( 2n ) is a perfect square, the power of 3 in ( n ) must be even, because any number times 2 must still result in an even exponent for it to form a perfect square. - Since ( 15n ) is a perfect cube, the power of 3 must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, as ( 15 = 3 times 5 ) and multiplying a power of 3 by 3^1 will result in a power divisible by 3 only leaving when such power adding up to 5n has already been catered to. - Therefore, the smallest value fitting both criteria is ( 3^2 = 9 ). 5. Finally, examine the factor of 5: - Since ( 2n ) is a perfect square, the power of 5 in ( n ) must be even. - Since ( 15n ) is a perfect cube, the power of 5 must also be multiple of 3. - Thus, the smallest even value of the power of 5 that is also a multiple of 3 is ( 2 ). 6. Combining these observations: - ( n ) must be of the form ( 2^3 times 3^2 times 5^2 = 1800 ). 7. Thus, we find that this condition satisfies both being a perfect square for ( 2n ) (as ( 2^4 times 3^2 times 5^2)) and perfect cube for ( 15n ) (as ( 2^3 times 3^3 times 5^3)).

The term (a_i b_j) involves both (a_i) and (b_j) being odd, hence (a_i b_j) is odd. 6. **Sum of Terms:** Since all terms except (a_i b_j) are even, the sum: [ sum_{substack{h+k=i+j}} a_h b_k ] will be odd because the even terms sum to an even number, and adding an odd number (a_i b_j) results in an odd number. This contradicts the given condition that all coefficients of the product polynomial are even. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our initial assumption that both polynomials have at least one odd coefficient cannot be true. Thus, one of the polynomials, say (P(x)), must have all coefficients even to ensure all terms in the product are at least even (since even multiplied by anything is even), avoiding any odd term in the final product. 8. **Remaining Polynomial:** If all coefficients of both (P(x)) and (Q(x)) were even, then each term in the product would be a multiple of 4 but this contradicts the problem condition.

We will then break the red squares into horizontal dominoes and the blue squares into vertical dominoes.

The variance measures how spread out the sales numbers are, which could be affected but not in a direct manner like the mode.

Since the number of Icelandic ponies with horseshoes must be a whole number, (15/80)P must be an integer. The fraction 15/80 can be simplified to 3/16. So, (3/16)P must be an integer.

Therefore, we have: [ sum_{1 leq i, j leq n} S_{i,j} = (2n-1)S ] 5. Since ( S_{i,j} geq a ) for all ( i, j ), we have: [ sum_{1 leq i, j leq n} S_{i,j} geq n^2 a ] 6. Combining the two equations, we get: [ (2n-1)S geq n^2 a ] 7. Solving for ( S ), we find: [ S geq frac{n^2 a}{2n-1} ] To check if this bound is achievable, consider filling the board with the value ( frac{a}{2n-1} ) in each cell. 8. If each cell contains ( frac{a}{2n-1} ), then the sum of any row or column is: [ n cdot frac{a}{2n-1} ] 9. The sum of the union of any row and column (a \\"cross\\") is: [ n cdot frac{a}{2n-1} + n cdot frac{a}{2n-1} - frac{a}{2n-1} = frac{2na - a}{2n-1} = a ] which satisfies the condition ( S_{i,j} geq a ). 10. Therefore, the sum ( S ) of all numbers on the board is: [ n^2 cdot frac{a}{2n-1} = frac{n^2 a}{2n-1} ] Thus, the smallest possible sum of all numbers on the board is ( frac{n^2 a}{2n-1} ).

So the selling price (SP) is: SP = CP + 35% of CP SP = 100 + 35% of 100 SP = 100 + 35 SP = 135 The discount given on the labeled price is the difference between the labeled price and the selling price: Discount = LP - SP Discount = 150 - 135 Discount = 15 The discount percentage on the labeled price is calculated as: Discount Percentage = (Discount / LP) * 100% Discount Percentage = (15 / 150) * 100% Discount Percentage = 0.1 * 100% Discount Percentage = 10% So, the discount percentage offered on the labeled price is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"Determine the positional relationship between the circles x^{2}+y^{2}2x2y+1=0 and x^{2}+y^{2}8x10y+25=0.

The reason is as follows: Assume -2 leq x_1 < x_2 leq 2, then x_1 - x_2 < 0, from the given information we have f(x_1 - x_2) < 0 Since f(x_1) - f(x_2) = f(x_1) + f(-x_2) = f(x_1 - x_2) < 0, Therefore, f(x_1) < f(x_2), Thus, f(x) is an increasing function in the interval [-2, 2].

In an arithmetic sequence, the sum of equidistant terms from the beginning and end of a set of terms (with a constant difference) is constant.

Since varphi(n) involves the terms (p_i - 1), for all i, the only way this can be satisfied is if each prime factor p_i of n appears exactly once in its prime factorization. Therefore, we require each a_i = 1, which implies: [ n = p_1 p_2 ldots p_k ] Additionally, since (n, varphi(n)) = 1, none of the prime factors p_i of n can divide varphi(n).

We construct a solution for m by solving the following simultaneous congruences: [ begin{cases} m equiv 0 pmod{p_i}, & forall p_i in A m equiv a pmod{p_i}, & forall p_i in B m equiv 1 pmod{varphi(n)} end{cases} ] By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), this system has a solution for m. Given p_i - 1 divides varphi(n), Fermat's Little Theorem ensures: [ m^{m} equiv m equiv a pmod{p_i}, quad forall p_i in B ] This indicates that such m satisfies the given condition m^m equiv a pmod{n}. 4. **Insufficiency of the condition if n does not meet the requirements**: **Case 1: n has a square factor p^2**: If there exists p^2 mid n, then there is no m such that m^m equiv p pmod{n}. This immediately violates the condition. **Case 2: (prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i, prod_{i=1}^{k}(p_i - 1)) neq 1**: Assume n does not contain square factors, but (prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i, prod_{i=1}^{k}(p_i - 1)) neq 1.

Since p_i divides m, it implies by considering Fermat's theorem and residue properties, contradictions arise.

Therefore, this statement is correct. **D: If angle alpha +angle beta +angle y=180^{circ}, then these three angles are complementary** - The definition of complementary angles is two angles whose sum is 90^{circ}. Since angle alpha +angle beta +angle y=180^{circ}, this implies that they sum up to 180^{circ}, which is the definition of supplementary angles, not complementary.

We are given the problem of 1994 students seated around a circular table playing a card-passing game. The rules are outlined such that each turn, one student with at least two cards passes one card to the left and one card to the right.

Therefore, the game could theoretically continue indefinitely, as there will always be at least one student who can pass cards. Conclusion for ( n > 1994 ): [ boxed{text{The game can continue indefinitely.}} ] - When ( n = 1994 ): - Assign students sequentially as ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_{1994} ). Initially, ( G_1 ) holds all the cards. - Define the \\"circulation value\\" of a card: when a card is held by ( G_i ), its value is ( i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq 1994 )). - Let ( S ) represent the sum of the circulation values of all cards. Initially, ( S = 1994 ). If a student ( G_i ) (with ( i in {1, 1994} )) passes cards, ( S ) can either increase or decrease by 1994 since 1994 students are passing and each has a unique identifier corresponding to their position. - When cards are passed from ( G_1 ) or ( G_{1994} ), ( S ) will be adjusted by ( pm1994 ). By modular arithmetic, we see: [ S equiv 0 pmod{1994} ] If each student eventually holds exactly one card apiece, then: [ S = 1 + 2 + cdots + 1994 = frac{1994 times 1995}{2} = 997 times 1995 ] Calculating the modulus, we have: [ 997 times 1995 equiv 997 pmod{1994} ] Since ( S equiv 0 pmod{1994} ) must hold, ( 997 notequiv 0 pmod{1994} ).

Since the pattern for higher values of ( p ) follows exponential growth quickly, another way to determine primality is by simplifying the expression modulo 5 and checking if the residue indicates a prime possibility. 5. Examine prime number creation and residue patterns: - For ( p = 3 ): [ 2^{2^{2^2}} mod 5 = 2^{16} mod 5 = (2^4)^4 mod 5 = 1^4 mod 5 = 1 ] Thus: [ 2^{2^{2^2}} + 9 equiv 1 + 9 equiv 10 equiv 0 mod 5 ] Hence, the number is not prime as it is divisible by 5. 6.

Let ( n ) be the total number of players in the tournament. We are given that the ten lowest scoring players earn half of their points against each other. 2.

Let ( x ) be the number of players excluding the ten lowest scoring players. Therefore, the total number of players is ( n = x + 10 ). 4. The ten lowest scoring players earn half of their points against the other ( x ) players. Since they earned 45 points among themselves, they must also earn 45 points against the other ( x ) players.

To approach this problem, we start by examining the form of cubes modulo ( 9 ). Let's consider the cube of ( 9k + m ) for different values of ( m ) and observe the results: 1. Calculate ((9k)^3): [ (9k)^3 = 9 cdot 9^2 k^3 ] Here, ( (9k)^3 ) is clearly divisible by ( 9 ), and thus, it is congruent to ( 0 mod 9 ). 2. Calculate ((9k pm 1)^3): [ (9k pm 1)^3 = (9k)^3 pm 3 cdot (9k)^2 + 3 cdot (9k) cdot 1 mp 1 = 9^3 k^3 pm 3 cdot 9^2 k^2 + 3 cdot 9k mp 1 ] Thus, [ (9k pm 1)^3 = 9(9^2 k^3 pm 3 cdot 9 k^2 + 3 k) mp 1 ] Modulo ( 9 ) we get: [ (9k pm 1)^3 equiv mp 1 mod 9 ] 3. Calculate ((9k pm 2)^3): [ (9k pm 2)^3 = (9k)^3 pm 3 cdot (9k)^2 cdot 2 + 3 cdot (9k) cdot 4 mp 8 = 9^3 k^3 pm 6 cdot 9^2 k^2 + 12 cdot 9k mp 8 ] Thus, [ (9k pm 2)^3 = 9(9^2 k^3 pm 6 cdot 9 k^2 + 12 k) mp 8 ] Modulo ( 9 ), we have: [ (9k pm 2)^3 equiv mp 8 equiv mp (-1) equiv pm 1 mod 9 ] 4. Calculate ((9k pm 3)^3): [ (9k pm 3)^3 = 3^3 (3k pm 1)^3 = 27(3k pm 1)^3 ] Thus, [ (9k pm 3)^3 equiv 27 cdot (text{something}) = 0 mod 9 ] 5. Calculate ((9k pm 4)^3): [ (9k pm 4)^3 = 9^3 k^3 pm 3 cdot (9k)^2 cdot 4 + 3 cdot 9k cdot 16 mp 64 = 9^3 k^3 pm 12 cdot 9^2 k^2 + 48 cdot 9k mp 64 ] Thus, [ (9k pm 4)^3 = 9(9^2 k^3 pm 12 cdot 9 k^2 + 48 k) pm 1 ] Modulo ( 9 ), we get: [ (9k pm 4)^3 equiv mp 1 mod 9 ] From the above calculations, we gather that cubes modulo ( 9 ) can result in ( 0, pm 1 ) only. Let's further evaluate if a number of the form ( 9t + 4 ) or ( 9t + 5 ) can be expressed as the sum of three such cubes: Suppose ( n = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ). Representing ( a, b, c ) modulo ( 9 ), we get: [ a^3, b^3, c^3 equiv 0, pm 1 mod 9 ] To sum up, our findings indicate that any combination of three such terms will be unable to cover all residues modulo ( 9 ). Specifically, numbers of the form ( 9t + 4 ) or ( 9t + 5 ) cannot be expressed as the sum of three cubes because neither ( 4 ) nor ( 5 ) appear in the sums possible from combinations of ( 0, pm 1 ). **Conclusion:** There exist infinitely many numbers that cannot be written as the sum of three perfect cubes, specifically those of the form ( 9t + 4 ) or ( 9t + 5 ).

The perimeter of a full circle (circumference) is given by the formula: Circumference of a circle = 2 * π * radius Since we only have a semicircle, we will take half of the circumference and add the diameter (which is twice the radius) to get the perimeter of the semicircle: Perimeter of semicircle = π * radius + 2 * radius Perimeter of semicircle = π * 12 + 2 * 12 Now, we can approximate π as 3.14159: Perimeter of semicircle ≈ 3.14159 * 12 + 2 * 12 Perimeter of semicircle ≈ 37.69908 + 24 Perimeter of semicircle ≈ 61.69908 units Finally, we combine the perimeters of the hexagon and the semicircle to get the total perimeter: Total perimeter ≈ Perimeter of hexagon + Perimeter of semicircle Total perimeter ≈ 72 + 61.69908 Total perimeter ≈ 133.69908 units Rounded to the nearest whole number, the approximate combined perimeter of the two shapes is boxed{134} units."},{"prompt":"Alex writes the sixteen digits 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9 side by side in any order and then places a colon somewhere between two digits, so that a division task arises.

So, we can set up the equation: Leftover milk (2 cups) = 50% of (Remaining milk after kids) Now, let's express the kids' consumption in terms of the total milk: Kids' consumption = x% of 16 cups To find the remaining milk after the kids have had their share, we subtract the kids' consumption from the total milk: Remaining milk after kids = 16 cups - (x% of 16 cups) Now, we know that 2 cups is equal to 50% of the remaining milk after the kids have had their share: 2 cups = 50% of (16 cups - (x% of 16 cups)) Let's solve for x: 2 cups = 0.5 * (16 cups - (x/100 * 16 cups)) 2 cups = 0.5 * (16 cups - 0.16x cups) 2 cups = 8 cups - 0.08x cups Now, we'll isolate x: 0.08x cups = 8 cups - 2 cups 0.08x cups = 6 cups Divide both sides by 0.08 to solve for x: x = 6 cups / 0.08 x = 75 Therefore, the percentage of the milk consumed by Daisy's kids is boxed{75%} ."},{"prompt":"All lines with equation ax+by=c such that a, b, c form a geometric progression pass through a common point.

Let ( R ) be the intersection point of the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ) and the perpendicular bisector of ( [MN] ). At this juncture, ( R ) becomes the excenter opposite vertex ( A ) (i.e., the excenter of triangle ( AMN )). 5. Consequently, quadrilateral ( RMAN ) is cyclic because point ( R ) is equidistant from vertices ( M ), ( A ), and ( N ). 6. Let ( X ) be the point where the circumcircle of triangle ( CNR ) intersects segment ( [BC] ). 7. Using cyclic properties and angle chasing: - In cyclic quadrilateral ( RMAN ), the opposite angles sum to ( 180^circ ). - Therefore, [ angle RNC = angle RNA ] - Similarly, the angle subtended by ( RM ) and ( RA ) in cyclic quadrilateral gives: [ angle RMB = angle RMA ] 8. Now, consider the angles: [ 180^circ - angle RXB = angle RXC = 180^circ - angle RNC = angle RNA = 180^circ - angle RMA = angle RMB ] 9.

Let the center of the moving circle be (a, b), where it satisfies the parabola's equation, which gives us b^2 = 4a. The tangent condition to the line x = -1 implies that the radius of the circle is a + 1 because the horizontal distance from the center to the line x = -1 is the radius of the circle. The equation of the moving circle can thus be written as: (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = (a + 1)^2. Expanding this equation yields: x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1. Since the circle passes through a fixed point, this point must satisfy the circle's equation for all values of a and b.

We know that student A scored 90 points and ranked 720th out of 800 students. This implies that 720 students scored 90 points or more. In terms of probability, this can be expressed as P(X geq 90). 2. Since the total number of students is 800, the probability that a student scored 90 points or more is frac{720}{800} = 0.9. This means that P(X geq 90) = 0.9. 3. By the symmetry property of the normal distribution, the probability that a score is less than or equal to a certain point above the mean is the same as the probability that a score is greater than or equal to a certain point below the mean. Therefore, P(X leq 120) = P(X geq 90) = 0.9. 4. To find the ranking of a student who scored 120 points, we need to calculate P(X geq 120).

These triangles are denoted as (T_1, T_2, ldots, T_{100}), where (T_i) has height (h_i) and area (A_i). 2. **Properties of triangles:** Let's denote the significant properties of these triangles. - For (i = 1), the height (h_1) and area (A_1) are initial values. - For (i > 1), the height of (T_i) is (200) times the height of (T_{i-1}): [ h_i = 200 cdot h_{i-1} ] - Similarly, the area of (T_i) is (frac{1}{20000}) times the area of (T_{i-1}): [ A_i = frac{A_{i-1}}{20000} ] 3. **Dividing a triangle:** For any triangle (T_i), we can divide it into (200) smaller regions by drawing (199) lines parallel to the base. These lines will divide the height into equal segments, each part corresponding to an equal fractional area. - Each segment divides the height into (200) equal parts. - The total area distribution, thus, is spread uniformly. 4. **Overlap and intersection:** Any triangle (T_j) with (j < i) can overlap with the parts of (T_i) in a limited manner: - Due to the size constraints and the uniform segment division, (T_j) can intersect with at most (2) segments of (T_i). - Consequently, at least (2) segments of (T_i) will be entirely free of any intersection with triangles numbered less than (i). Each of these segments has an area that corresponds to at least (frac{1}{200} times A_i). 5. **Conclusion about the area:** - Since the total area covered by any set of (99) triangles (except (T_i)) is insufficient to completely cover (T_i) due to the chosen property of areas (each getting exponentially smaller while heights grow larger), there will always be parts of (T_i) that remain uncovered.

This effectively creates two symmetric 1 times 94 rectangular regions on either side of the colored square. Therefore, if an 18 times 18 square is colored adjacent to the longer side of the 19 times 94 grid, it ensures the gameboard has a mirrored configuration relative to the vertical axis passing through the middle of the initial square.

This mirroring allows the first player to ensure that no square can be fully colored by the second player without a corresponding and symmetrical counter by the first player. 4. **Ensure Winning Conditions**: - Since the second player cannot complete a square crossing the axis of symmetry, the first player always has a move if they follow this strategy. Eventually, when all the squares bar one are filled, it will be the turn of the first player to color the last remaining square and thus win the game. # Conclusion By following the strategy of constructing an initial 18 times 18 square aligned with the axis of symmetry and responding symmetrically to the second player's moves, the first player ensures winning by coloring the last square on the grid.

If no discount applies, the actual price is 560 yuan. 2. If a discount applies, then the actual price is calculated as 560 times frac{10}{8} = 700 yuan, because the discount reverses the 20% reduction. Similarly, for Xiao Wang's mother's payment of 640 yuan, since it falls into the discount range, the actual price is calculated as 640 times frac{10}{8} = 800 yuan. Now, let's consider the total payment if they pay together: 1. **Scenario 1 (No discount on 560 item):** The total actual price is 560 + 800 = 1360 yuan. The payment for this total amount is calculated as follows: - For the first 900 yuan, a 20% discount applies, so 900 times 0.8 = 720 yuan. - For the remaining 460 yuan (1360 - 900), a 40% discount applies, so 460 times 0.6 = 276 yuan. - Therefore, the total payment is 720 + 276 = 996 yuan. 2. **Scenario 2 (Discount on both items):** The total actual price is 700 + 800 = 1500 yuan. The payment for this total amount is calculated as follows: - For the first 900 yuan, a 20% discount applies, so 900 times 0.8 = 720 yuan. - For the remaining 600 yuan (1500 - 900), a 40% discount applies, so 600 times 0.6 = 360 yuan. - Therefore, the total payment is 720 + 360 = 1080 yuan.

Now, we need to make sure that the ratios of flour to water and flour to sugar in the new recipe are consistent with each other.

The value of P= log_{2}3 is the exponent to which the number 2 must be raised to get 3. Since 2^1 = 2 and 2^2 = 4, it's clear that 1 < P < 2 because 2 < 3 < 4. 2. Similarly, Q= log_{3}2 is the exponent to which the number 3 must be raised to obtain the number 2. As 3^0 = 1 and 3^1 = 3, it's clear that 0 < Q < 1 as 1 < 2 < 3. Now we will use the Change of Base Formula for logarithms to compare P and Q: Q = log_{3}2 = frac{1}{log_{2}3} = frac{1}{P}. Since P > 1, we have Q < 1 (because Q is the reciprocal of P). 3. To understand R= log_{2}(log_{3}2), let's break it down: R = log_{2}(log_{3}2) = log_{2}Q. Since we already established Q<1, then R must be negative because we are looking for the exponent that gives a result less than 1 when using base 2 (recall that 2^0 = 1 and any positive exponent would yield a result greater than 1).

Let the original number be ( N ), with the first digit ( a ) (most significant digit) and the last digit ( b ), i.e., ( N = overline{a ldots b} ). 2. We assume, contrary to the statement, that twice the number ( N ) is equal to the number obtained by writing the digits of ( N ) in reverse order. That is, ( 2N = overline{b ldots a} ). 3. Since ( 2N ) is an even number, its last digit must also be even, i.e., ( a ) must be an even digit. 4. Furthermore, ( 2N ) has the same number of digits as ( N ), implying that ( a ) must be less than 5. Hence, ( a ) can only be 2 or 4. 5. **Case 1:** ( a = 2 ) - If ( a = 2 ), the first digit of ( 2N ) is 4 or 5, depending on any possible carry-over during multiplication by 2. - However, doubling the digits of ( N ) and considering possible carry-overs, the last digit of ( 2N ) (which would be the last digit after reversing and doubling) would be either 8 or 0, not 2. 6. **Case 2:** ( a = 4 ) - If ( a = 4 ), then ( b ) (the first digit of the reversed number, which would be the last digit of ( 2N ) after doubling) could only be 8 or 9, depending again on the carry-over. - Doubling the value will make ( 2N ) end in 6 or 8, which contradicts the requirement for ( 2N ) to end in 4. 7.

( b = 2a + 2 ) is impossible, because such numbers when divided by 2 would start with the digit ( a+1 ), not ( a ). 3. First, analyze whether ( 2b ) reaches or exceeds 10. Since ( 2b < 20 ), there are two cases: - If ( 2b = a ) - If ( 2b = a + 10 ) 4. Substituting the possible values for ( b ) from the cases ( b = 2a + 1 ) or ( b = 2a ): - ( 4a + 2 = a ) - ( 4a + 2 = a + 10 ) - ( 4a = a ) - ( 4a = a + 10 ) 5.

Prove that the quadrilateral is either a trapezoid or a cyclic quadrilateral.","completion":"1. Let's consider a convex quadrilateral, where the angles at its vertices are denoted by (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). According to the problem, the sum of the cosines of these angles is zero, i.e., [ cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma + cos delta = 0 ] 2. We can use the trigonometric identity for the sum of cosines, specifically, [ cos A + cos B = 2 cos left( frac{A+B}{2} right) cos left( frac{A-B}{2} right) ] Applying this identity to pairs of angles, we get: [ cos alpha + cos beta = 2 cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) ] [ cos gamma + cos delta = 2 cos left( frac{gamma + delta}{2} right) cos left( frac{gamma - delta}{2} right) ] 3. Substituting these into the initial equation, we obtain: [ 2 cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) + 2 cos left( frac{gamma + delta}{2} right) cos left( frac{gamma - delta}{2} right) = 0 ] 4. Recognizing that (gamma + delta = 360^circ - (alpha + beta)) for a quadrilateral, we substitute this relationship into our equation: [ 2 cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) - 2 cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) cos left( frac{gamma - delta}{2} right) = 0 ] This simplifies to: [ cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) left( cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) - cos left( frac{gamma - delta}{2} right) right) = 0 ] 5. This equation holds if either: - (cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = 0), or - (cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) = cos left( frac{gamma - delta}{2} right)) 6. Considering the first possibility, (cos left( frac{alpha + beta}{2} right) = 0): - This implies (frac{alpha + beta}{2} = frac{pi}{2}), or (alpha + beta = 180^circ). - Therefore, the quadrilateral would be a trapezoid since the sum of the interior angles between the parallel sides is (180^circ). 7. For the second possibility, (cos left( frac{alpha - beta}{2} right) = cos left( frac{gamma - delta}{2} right)): - This can be true if either (frac{alpha - beta}{2} = frac{gamma - delta}{2}) or (frac{alpha - beta}{2} = -frac{gamma - delta}{2}). - Resulting in either (alpha - beta = gamma - delta) or (alpha - beta = delta - gamma). - These imply (alpha + delta = beta + gamma) or (alpha + gamma = beta + delta). 8. In the case where (alpha + delta = beta + gamma), the shape of the quadrilateral remains trapezoidal. If (alpha + gamma = beta + delta), then it forms a cyclic quadrilateral (i.e., a quadrilateral that can be inscribed in a circle). # Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that the quadrilateral is either a trapezoid or a cyclic quadrilateral: [ boxed{text{The quadrilateral is either a trapezoid or cyclic quadrilateral.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a positive integer ( n geq 2 ), let the positive integers ( a_i ) (for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n )) satisfy ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_n ) and ( sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_i} leq 1 ).

If grasshopper A jumps over grasshopper B, it lands at the same distance from B but on the opposite side along the same line. Can one of the grasshoppers end up at the fourth vertex of the square after several jumps?","completion":"We have three grasshoppers located at three vertices of a square, playing leapfrog. When grasshopper (A) jumps over grasshopper (B), it lands on the same straight line, at the same distance from (B) but on the opposite side. To determine whether it is possible for one of the grasshoppers to jump into the fourth vertex of the square, we will examine their positions using a grid. Step-by-Step: 1. **Grid Coloring**: - Color the grid as shown in the referenced figure, with white and black nodes. - The square's vertices are considered as nodes of the grid where three grasshoppers initially sit at white nodes. 2. **Symmetry and Node Movement**: - Consider the symmetry with respect to a white node—a white node transforms into another white node. By symmetry, if a grasshopper jumps over from one white node, it can only land on another white node. - To prove this, we need to verify that a black node would transform into another black node and a white node into another white node under reflection about a white node. 3. **Mathematical Justification**: - Let (A) be a black node, (B) a white node, and (A_1) the image of point (A) after reflection relative to (B). The point (A_1) will be a black node if and only if the vector ( overrightarrow{A A_1} = 2m mathbf{e}_1 + 2n mathbf{e}_2), where (m) and (n) are integers. - Since ( overrightarrow{A A_1} = 2 overrightarrow{A B} = 2(m mathbf{e}_1 + n mathbf{e}_2)), (A_1) must be a black node as the transformation involved multiples of 2. 4. **Conclusion from Symmetric Moves**: - Each jump, being a reflection across another vertex, ensures that grasshoppers can only move between nodes of the same color (i.e., white to white or black to black). - Therefore, a grasshopper initially on a white node cannot move to a black node, confirming that they can never jump into the fourth vertex of the square if it is not aligned in the same color as the starting vertices. Given the setup and analysis, grasshoppers can never change their positional coloration group and hence are restricted to their initial group’s color nodes. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{A grasshopper cannot land on the fourth vertex of the square.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, how many even threedigit numbers less than 500 can be formed if each digit can be used more than once?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the restrictions on each digit place (hundreds, tens, and units) for forming even three-digit numbers less than 500 using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, with repetition allowed. 1. **Hundreds Digit**: For a number to be less than 500, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4.

From equation 1, we can express ( y ) in terms of ( x ): [ y = 50 - x ] Substitute ( y ) in equation 2: [ 0.40x + 0.80(50 - x) = 25 ] Now, solve for ( x ): [ 0.40x + 40 - 0.80x = 25 ] [ -0.40x = 25 - 40 ] [ -0.40x = -15 ] [ x = frac{-15}{-0.40} ] [ x = 37.5 ] Now, find ( y ) using the value of ( x ): [ y = 50 - 37.5 ] [ y = 12.5 ] So, we have 37.5 ounces of Solution A and 12.5 ounces of Solution B. The ratio of Solution A to Solution B is ( x:y ) which is ( 37.5:12.5 ). To simplify this ratio, we can divide both numbers by 12.5: [ frac{37.5}{12.5}:frac{12.5}{12.5} ] [ 3:1 ] Therefore, the ratio in which you could mix Solution A with Solution B to produce 50 ounces of a 50% salt solution is boxed{3:1} ."},{"prompt":"A triangleshaped grid of points is labeled as follows: vertices of the large triangle are A, B, C, and inside, there is one additional point placed at the centroid, labeled D.

This is a multiple of 10. 4. **Subsequent Moves:** - Suppose that Vasya takes ( k ) stones where ( 1 leq k leq 9 ): - After Vasya's turn, there are ( 110 - k ) stones left. - Petya's next move will be to take ( 10 - k ) stones: - The new total number of stones becomes ( 110 - k - (10 - k) = 100 ), which maintains the multiple of 10 condition. 5. **General Rule:** - After any of Vasya's moves, the number of stones will be ( 10m + k ) (for some integer ( m ) and ( 1 leq k leq 9 )). - Petya will always take ( 10 - k ) stones to ensure the remaining stones are a multiple of 10. 6. **Endgame Scenario:** - Petya will reduce the number of stones periodically such that when the pile is reduced to precisely 10 stones, Petya can force the game towards his victory. - No matter what Vasya does in this setup, Petya will always be in a favorable position to take the last stone. 7. **Conclusion:** - By always leaving Vasya a multiple of 10 stones, Petya can eventually force Vasya into taking from a remaining pile of 10 stones. - After Vasya takes any number of stones from this final set of 10, Petya can take the remaining stones (since they will be between 1 and 9).

We are given that r_m = 2. We are also given that when m - n is divided by 6, the remainder is 5. This can be expressed as: m - n ≡ 5 (mod 6) Since m ≡ 2 (mod 6), we can substitute m in the above equation: 2 - n ≡ 5 (mod 6) To find the value of n that satisfies this equation, we can add 6 to the left side until we get a number that is congruent to 5 modulo 6. Starting with 2 and adding 6 gives us 8, which is not congruent to 5 modulo 6. However, if we add 6 again, we get 14, which is congruent to 5 modulo 6 because 14 - 5 = 9, which is a multiple of 6. So, we have: 2 - n ≡ 14 (mod 6) Now, we can solve for n: -n ≡ 12 (mod 6) n ≡ -12 (mod 6) Since we are looking for a positive remainder, we can add multiples of 6 to -12 until we get a positive number that is less than 6. Adding 6 twice gives us 0, and adding 6 once more gives us 6, which is equivalent to 0 modulo 6. However, since we are looking for a remainder when n is divided by 6, and we know that m > n, the remainder cannot be 0 because that would imply n is a multiple of 6 and m would be at least 6 more than n, which would not leave a remainder of 2 when m is divided by 6. Therefore, we need to find a positive remainder for n that is less than 6 and when subtracted from 2 leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 6.

Let's first add the two 3-digit numbers: 4a3 +984 ____ 13b7 Now, let's find the values of 'a' and 'b' that make 13b7 divisible by 11.

Amber can choose any two non-empty piles, and Barbara can move one stone from one pile to the other. Amber wins if she can eventually make an empty pile. 2. **Objective**: Determine the smallest ( k ) such that Amber can always win. 3. **Strategy**: Amber's strategy is to always choose two piles with the same number of stones. After Barbara's move, one pile will have one stone less and the other will have one stone more. This ensures that the total number of stones remains constant, but the distribution changes. 4. **Sum of Squares Argument**: Consider the sum of the squares of the number of stones in each pile. Initially, each pile has 2020 stones, so the sum of squares is: [ k times 2020^2 ] When Amber chooses two piles with ( m ) stones each, and Barbara moves one stone, the new configuration will have piles with ( m-1 ) and ( m+1 ) stones. The sum of squares changes as follows: [ m^2 + m^2 rightarrow (m-1)^2 + (m+1)^2 ] Calculating the new sum of squares: [ (m-1)^2 + (m+1)^2 = m^2 - 2m + 1 + m^2 + 2m + 1 = 2m^2 + 2 ] This shows that the sum of squares increases by 2 with each move: [ 2m^2 < 2m^2 + 2 ] 5. **Bounded Sum of Squares**: The sum of squares is bounded by ( k times 2020^2 ). Since the sum of squares strictly increases with each move, the process must eventually terminate. 6. **Distinct Number of Stones**: When the process terminates, each pile must have a distinct number of stones. If no pile has 0 stones, the minimum sum of stones is: [ 1 + 2 + cdots + k = frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] For ( k ) piles, the total number of stones is ( k times 2020 ).

Simplifying the above, we get: 4b^2 + 8b + 4 + b^2 - 8b + 16 = 4b^2 + 8b + 4 + b^2 - 12b + 36. Cancelling out the identical terms on both sides and simplifying further gives: 24 = 4b.

Firstly, express 50688 in its prime factorization: [ 50688 = 2^9 times 99. ] 3. Given (frac{50688}{m+n}) is an odd positive power of 2, let (frac{50688}{m+n} = 2^k) where ( k ) is odd. This implies: [ m+n = frac{50688}{2^k} = 2^{9-k} times 99. ] To ensure (frac{50688}{m+n}) is a power of 2, (2^k) must directly divide 50688 and the remaining factor must be an odd integer (99). 4. Since (k) must be odd, let's list the possible values of (k) that are less than or equal to 9 (as (2^{9-k}) must remain an integer): [ k = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. ] 5. Therefore, the possible values of ( m+n ) are: [ begin{aligned} k = 1 & implies m+n = 2^{8} times 99, k = 3 & implies m+n = 2^{6} times 99, k = 5 & implies m+n = 2^{4} times 99, k = 7 & implies m+n = 2^{2} times 99, k = 9 & implies m+n = 2^{0} times 99 = 99. end{aligned} ] 6. For each ( k ), the number ( m+n ) values has valid pair distributions: - For ( k = 1 ): ( m+n = 99 times 256 = 25344 ). [ text{Pairs } (m, n): text{ from } (0, 25344) text{ to } (25344, 0), text{ total } 25344+1 = 25345. ] - For ( k = 3 ): ( m+n = 99 times 64 = 6336 ).

[ text{Pairs } (m, n): text{ from } (0, 99) text{ to } (99, 0), text{ total } 99+1 = 100. ] 7. Adding the total number of pairs: [ 25345 + 6337 + 1585 + 397 + 100 = 33764. ] 8. Since we need ( m neq n ), subtract 5 cases where ( m = n ): - ( k = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ). 9.

Let's denote this natural number by c_n, i.e., we have: [ a^{n} + b^{n} = c_n^{n+1} ] 2. **Bounding c_n:** First, we observe that c_n leq a + b, because if c_n were greater: [ c_n^{n+1} > (a + b)^{n+1} > a^{n} + b^{n} ] This situation would contradict our initial equation a^{n} + b^{n} = c_n^{n+1}. 3. **Infinite Repetitions of Bound:** Since c_n exists for all natural n, there must be at least one value of c leq a + b that repeats infinitely many times. Thus, we can deduce an equation for certain fixed value c: [ a^{n} + b^{n} = c^{n+1} ] This equation must hold for infinitely many natural numbers n. 4. **Assumption ( a geq b ):** Without loss of generality, we assume a geq b.

This determinant can be interpreted geometrically as twice the area of the triangle formed by the points (0,0), (a_i, b_i), and (a_j, b_j).

We replace (a) and (b) with (a^2 - 2011b^2) and (ab). Since (a) is divisible by (k), (ab) is also divisible by (k). Additionally, if both (a) and (b) are divisible by (k), then (a^2 - 2011 b^2) is also divisible by (k).

Suppose this remains true throughout any sequence of operations. 5. **Specific Case Analysis:** - Among the initial 10 consecutive natural numbers, consider the number (a) that ends in 5 (specifically, (a) is of the form (10m + 5) where (m) is an integer). - Let (b) be the other number paired with (a) in an operation. 6. **Odd (b) Case:** - Assume (b) is odd. Then (a^2 - 2011b^2) results in an even number again due to the parity of 2011 and (b^2). This increases the count of even numbers, leading to a contradiction since we should maintain the number of even numbers. 7. **Even but not Multiple of 10 (b) Case:** - If (b) is an even number but not a multiple of 10, then (ab) results in a multiple of 10 due to (a) ending in 5. This increases the count of multiples of 10. 8. **Divisibility by 10:** - If (b) is a multiple of 10, both (a) and (b) are multiples of 5. So, (ab) (multiples of 25) does not match any of the consecutive numbers afterward. 9. **Final State Contradiction:** - The terminal condition of 10 consecutive natural numbers will not hold because either the count of even numbers or multiples of 10 will contradict the initial parity and equivalence. 10. **Conclusion:** Through all cases and containment analysis, we find that retaining the property of 10 consecutive natural numbers is impossible after these operations.

This is because in a pair of intersecting circles, the line connecting the centers is the perpendicular bisector of the common chord. 3. **Properties of Intersecting Chords**: - Since the circles have the same radius, let ( R ) be the radius of both circles. Also, because ( B ) lies on both circles, any point ( X ) on one circle and point ( Y ) on the other circle, such that ( B ) lies on ( XY ), would make ( XY ) pass through ( B ). 4. **Midpoint Calculation**: - By the property of intersecting chords in a circle, the midpoint ( M ) of segment ( XY ) will always lie on the line that serves as the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ). 5. **Circle with Diameter ( AB )**: - Given that ( A ) and ( B ) are fixed points, the collection of all midpoints ( M ) of the line segments ( XY ) that pass through ( B ) and intersect the circles will lie on a circle with ( AB ) as the diameter. - This is because the midpoints of chords drawn from any point on the circumference of a circle subtend a right angle at the center of the circle (the midpoint lies equidistant from the endpoints of the diameter). 6. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the loci of points ( M ) must form a circle with ( AB ) as its diameter, as all such points are equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ) and respect the symmetrical property necessitated by the equal radius condition of the intersecting circles.

These are the foot of the perpendiculars from (X) to each side of the quadrilateral. 3. **Homothety argument**: - Consider a homothety (scaling transformation) centered at (X) with a scaling factor of 2. This essentially means doubling the distances of all the points relative to (X). - Under this transformation, the projections (E, F, G, H) are transformed into the points where the lines perpendicular to sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA) intersect those sides again. 4. **Define cocyclicity condition**: - Points are cocyclic if they lie on the same circle. This condition can be verified using various properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, such as the fact that opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to (180^circ). 5. **Verification through angle conditions**: - Consider the cyclic nature of the quadrilateral formed by the feet of the perpendiculars. Using basic geometric properties: - The angles formed between the perpendiculars from (X) and the diagonal intersections (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) can be seen as right angles. This is due to (X) being the intersection of diagonals. - Check that ( angle EXF = angle BXH). This is due to similar argument quarters. 6. **Conclude cocyclicity**: - By recognizing symmetry and the properties induced by right angles at (X), it can be shown that these projections must form a cyclic quadrilateral. 7. **Final Conclusion**: - Therefore, the four points that are the reflections of (X) over the sides of the quadrilateral (ABCD) lie on a common circle. boxed{text{The reflected points are cocyclic.}}"},{"prompt":"a certain exam, there are 50 questions.

The score pattern for each team is as follows: - In the first match, a team scores 1 goal, - In the second match, the team scores 2 goals, - ..., and in the tenth match, the team scores 10 goals. 2. **Pairs and Matches**: - The total number of matches played is determined by the combination formula for selecting 2 teams out of 11. This is given by: [ text{Total matches} = binom{11}{2} = frac{11 times 10}{2} = 55 ] 3. **Pairing of Matches**: - Each team plays 10 matches. For any match to end in a draw (tie), the goals scored by each team in that match must be the same. - If a match ends in a draw between two teams, the goals they scored must be the same for both, which corresponds to the same match number for both teams. 4. **Goal Analysis**: - In any given match, say match k, each team scores exactly k goals. So for a match to tie, both teams must play the same number of matches and score k goals each. 5. **Counting Drawn Matches**: - As there are 11 teams and each team has to play unique matches with every other team, the total unique goal sets for each match-theoretically must be distinct due to the unique nature of k for each match, assuming all matches follow the rule set. 6. **Detailed Counting of Draws**: - Since the number of teams (11) is odd, it’s impossible to arrange all the teams in perfect pairs for all matches because every team needs an opponent, and one team would end up not having a pair. This unpaired scenario prevents perfect draws for each round. - Each team playing in an odd number scenario inherently unbalances the pairs. This inherently enforces at least one non-draw per match set round. - We reframe to consider reasons beyond pairings: 55 game limits, but round-robin pair stability equilibrium ensures some non-draw scenarios. 7. **Calculation of Max Draws Possible**: - If there are 55 matches in total, ensuring there’s a minimum of 5 non-draws due to mispair unavoidability: [ text{Maximum Draws} = 55 - 5 = 50 ] 8. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the maximum number of matches that could end in a draw is: [ boxed{50} ]"},{"prompt":"On a particular day at work, Michael produces p products per hour and works for h hours.

Therefore, we have: [ angle AKC = angle AKB = 180^{circ} - angle BAC ] Given that angle ABK = angle KAC, it follows that triangles triangle AKB and triangle CKA are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

First, we can factor ( p^2 - q^2 ) as a difference of squares: ( p^2 - q^2 = (p + q)(p - q) ) Since ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct prime numbers greater than 5, both ( p ) and ( q ) are odd (since 2 is the only even prime number, and both are greater than 5). Therefore, ( p + q ) and ( p - q ) are both even numbers. Now, let's consider the possible remainders when an even number is divided by 24. An even number can have a remainder of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, or 22 when divided by 24. Since ( p ) and ( q ) are both odd, ( p - q ) is an even number, and since they are distinct primes, ( p - q ) is at least 2. Also, ( p + q ) is even and greater than ( p - q ), so ( (p + q)(p - q) ) is a product of two even numbers, which means it is divisible by 4. Now, we need to check divisibility by 3 to ensure divisibility by 24 (since 24 = 3 * 8, and we already have the factor of 4). Since ( p^2 - q^2 = 6k ), it is already divisible by 6, which means it is divisible by 3. Therefore, ( p^2 - q^2 ) is divisible by both 4 and 3, which means it is divisible by 12. However, we need to ensure that it is divisible by 24, not just 12. To be divisible by 24, ( p^2 - q^2 ) must also be divisible by 8. Since ( p ) and ( q ) are odd, ( p^2 ) and ( q^2 ) are both 1 modulo 8 (because any odd number squared is 1 modulo 8). Therefore, ( p^2 - q^2 ) is 0 modulo 8. Combining the divisibility by 3 and by 8, we conclude that ( p^2 - q^2 ) is divisible by 24. Thus, the remainder when ( p^2 - q^2 ) is divided by 24 is boxed{0} ."},{"prompt":"Given two triangles on a plane with no common interior or boundary points, show that there is a side line of one of the triangles such that the interiors of the two triangles lie on opposite sides of this line.","completion":"The problem requires us to demonstrate that for any two triangles in the plane, they must lie on opposite sides of some suitably chosen line. 1. **Consideration of Triangles**: Let ABC be an arbitrary triangle and Q be an arbitrary interior point on the segment AB.

Points in S_{AB} have their closest point on ABC as some point on AB. - Similarly, let S_{BC} and S_{CA} be the regions generated similarly around sides BC and CA respectively, where the closest points are on the corresponding sides. 4. **Mutual Exclusivity**: - Because these regions are mutually exclusive and non-overlapping, deduced from the perpendiculars creating the regions covering angles less than 90^circ inside, with 90^circ total to the perpendiculars between these segments only adding up to more than 90^circ, their respective complements T_A, T_B, and T_C are defined. - For example, T_B includes all points in the sector formed by the perpendiculars at B along AB and BC. 5. **Point Proximity Verification**: - For any point U in T_B, labeled U and any point V within or on ABC, the segments BU and BV form an angle of at least 90^circ, ensuring BU < UV. Similarly, the argument extends to other such sectors. 6. **Generalization**: - With the six regions covering the part of the plane excluding ABC, for any triangle DEF with no common points with ABC, the closest points on ABC can be marked as D_0, E_0, and F_0. Conversely, the closest points on triangle DEF to A, B, and C are A_0, B_0, and C_0. 7. **Selection of Minimal Distance Pair**: - Identify the minimal pair among AA_0, BB_0, CC_0, DD_0, EE_0, and FF_0, let it be DD_0. If D_0 lies within a segment such as AB, then AB is the required line. - This is due to D_0’s closest point condition and a perpendicular property forming acute to right angles on either segment beyond the triangle. 8. **Intersection Condition**: - If D_0 is a vertex, such as B, defining half-planes perpendicular to BD at B and D clearly separate ABC and DEF. - By rotating BD around B and D, any first intersection within two rotations validates a line through one triangle's vertex angle to the opposite segment separating DEF from ABC. Thus, aligning a suitably chosen line separates the interiors of the two triangles. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"On Monday at work, David produces w widgets per hour, and works for t hours.

We are given a tetrahedron in which a section has been drawn. We need to determine whether the depiction of the section in the form of a quadrilateral (specifically a four-sided polygon) is correct. 2. The central idea is understanding the basic properties of planes and lines in 3-dimensional space. Specifically, we need to verify whether the section, which results in a four-sided polygon, can be a valid flat (planar) section through the tetrahedron. 3. Importantly, for a section of a tetrahedron to be planar, any lines extended from opposite sides of the section (if they are extended beyond the tetrahedron edges) must only intersect at a single point. This is because a plane in three-dimensional space can intersect a given line at most at one unique point. 4. Analyzing the provided solution: if we extend the opposite sides of the depicted polygon, they appear to intersect the extension of the front edge of the tetrahedron at two distinct points. By logic, this scenario cannot happen in flat (planar) geometry. This is because a single line in a plane intersecting the plane cannot meet the plane at more than one point. 5. Therefore, the existence of two intersection points with the front edge indicates that this four-sided figure cannot lie entirely in one plane.

Since x_{1} < x_{2}, we have x_{1}=a-sqrt{a^{2}+1} and x_{2}=a+sqrt{a^{2}+1}. 2. From part 1, we know x_{1}+x_{2}=2a and x_{1}cdot x_{2}=-1. The slope of line AB is k= frac{y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}= frac{x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}=x_{1}+x_{2}.

The total number of visitors for the month can be calculated by multiplying the average number of visitors per day by the number of days in the month: Total visitors for the month = Average visitors per day * Number of days Total visitors for the month = 125 * 30 Now, we can express the total number of visitors for the month as the sum of the visitors on Sundays and the visitors on other days: Total visitors for the month = (Number of Sundays * Average visitors on Sunday) + (Number of other days * Average visitors on other days) Total visitors for the month = (5 * 150) + (25 * V) Now we can set up the equation: 125 * 30 = (5 * 150) + (25 * V) Solving for V: 3750 = 750 + 25V 3750 - 750 = 25V 3000 = 25V V = 3000 / 25 V = 120 So, the library has an average of boxed{120} visitors on other days (Monday to Saturday)."},{"prompt":"Determine the locus of the intersection point of lines e and f, where line e passes through the point (1, 1), line f passes through the point (1, 1), and the difference in their slopes is 2.","completion":"Given two lines ( e ) and ( f ) passing through points ((1, 1)) and ((-1, 1)) respectively, and the difference in their slopes is 2.

The midpoint of each edge can be connected to the midpoints of other edges, but not all combinations are geometrically possible through a single line. Step 2: Lines intersecting midpoints - Each line can intersect either four midpoints, forming two intersecting segments across T which are not coplanar but form a straight line through T (crossing the tetrahedron's body). - Analyzing symmetries and configurations, a minimum configuration requires using separate lines for each pair of opposite edges (which do not belong to the same face), hence 3 lines (since T has 6 edges, and one line handles two opposite edges). - Maximum configuration, on the other hand, can be envisioned by using one line per edge pair on each face (if it seemed geometrically feasible and each pair was countable distinctly), but sticking to standard combinatorics, the same 3 lines are sufficient since each line, due to symmetry, is capable of intersecting edges in such a minimal arrangement. Step 3: Calculate the maximum and minimum values of m - Both maximum and minimum number of lines m is 3 due to optimal symmetry handling of all required midpoints.

The larger angle is then x + 20^circ. Their relationship can be expressed as: [ x + (x + 20^circ) = 105^circ ] Simplifying: [ 2x + 20^circ = 105^circ implies 2x = 105^circ - 20^circ = 85^circ implies x = frac{85^circ}{2} = 42.5^circ ] Therefore, the smaller angle is 42.5^circ. 3. **Calculate the measure of the second angle**: The second angle, being 20^circ larger than the first, is: [ x + 20^circ = 42.5^circ + 20^circ = 62.5^circ ] The second angle is 62.5^circ. 4. **Utilize the Triangle Sum Theorem for the third angle**: The sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ.

However, this is the initial setup, and we need to correct it to reflect the actual conditions given in the problem.

For a prism with a polygonal base: - The number of edges (E_p) is three times the number of sides of the base polygon (since each side of the base has a corresponding parallel side and there are edges connecting corresponding vertices). - The number of faces (F_p) is two plus the number of sides of the base polygon (since there are two bases and the lateral faces equal to the number of sides of the base). For a pyramid with a polygonal base: - The number of edges (E_py) is twice the number of sides of the base polygon (since each side of the base has one edge going up to the apex). - The number of faces (F_py) is one plus the number of sides of the base polygon (since there is one base and the lateral faces equal to the number of sides of the base). Given that the sum of the edges of the prism and pyramid is 30, we can write the following equation: E_p + E_py = 30 Let's denote the number of sides of the base polygon as n.

Let's denote the end point of this measurement as ( A ). 4. **Utilizing Point \`A\` to Find Projections:** - From point ( A ), draw a secant line passing through the center of the circle.

According to problem 333(a), the sum of the squares of the distances from a point on the circumcircle of a regular n-gon to all its vertices is equal to 2nR^2. 2. Let ( M ) coincide with one of the vertices, say ( A_1 ). Then the sum of the squares of all the sides and diagonals emanating from ( A_1 ) in the n-gon is ( 2nR^2 ). 3. Since each side and diagonal is counted twice when considering all vertices, to find the total sum of the squares of all sides and diagonals in the n-gon, we need to multiply by n (the number of vertices) and then divide by 2: [ text{Sum} = frac{n cdot 2nR^2}{2} = n^2 R^2. ] Therefore, the sum of the squares of all the sides and diagonals is: [ boxed{n^2 R^2} ] Part (b) **To prove:** The sum of all the sides and all the diagonals of an n-gon is n cot left( frac{pi}{2n} right) R. **Solution:** 1.

The distance between two vertices ( A_i ) and ( A_{i+k} ) (including sides and diagonals) is ( 2R sinleft( frac{kpi}{n} right) ). Thus, the sum of all such distances from ( A_1 ) is: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2R sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right). ] 3. Using the result from problem 334(b), we have: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right) = frac{sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) cdot sinleft(frac{(n-1)pi}{2n}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2n}right)} = frac{sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right)}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2n}right)}. ] 4. Since ( sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 1 ), the above reduces to: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right) = frac{1}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2n}right)}. ] 5. Therefore: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 2R sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right) = 2R cdot frac{1}{sinleft(frac{pi}{2n}right)} = 2R cotleft(frac{pi}{2n}right). ] 6.

Consider the product of the lengths of all sides and diagonals emanating from one vertex ( A_1 ). Given that the length from one vertex ( A_1 ) to another ( A_i ) is ( 2R sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right) ). 2. The product of all these lengths is: [ prod_{k=1}^{n-1} left(2R sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right)right). ] 3. This can be simplified to: [ (2R)^{n-1} prod_{k=1}^{n-1} sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right). ] 4. Using the identity for the product of sine terms: [ prod_{k=1}^{n-1} sinleft(frac{kpi}{n}right) = frac{n}{2^{n-1}}. ] 5. Therefore: [ (2R)^{n-1} cdot frac{n}{2^{n-1}} = 2^{n-1}R^{n-1} cdot frac{n}{2^{n-1}} = nR^{n-1}. ] 6. To include all vertices, we raise this product to the power ( n ) and then take the ( frac{1}{2} )-th power because each side and diagonal is counted twice: [ left(nR^{n-1}right)^n = n^n R^{(n-1)n} = n^n R^{n^2-n}. ] 7.

Substituting (11, 95) into y = kx + b, we get 95 = 11k + b. Solving these two equations simultaneously: - Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 10 = -2k, which simplifies to k = -5. - Substituting k = -5 into 105 = 9k + b gives 105 = -45 + b, which simplifies to b = 150.

To be consistent with parallelism to the x-axis, this means that C(x, 2) must be parallel. This situation shows that both points share the same y-coordinate. 3.

Part (2): Odd Function For the function f(x)=frac{x}{4-{x}^{2}}, to prove it's an odd function, we check the condition for odd functions f(-x) = -f(x): begin{align*} f(-x) &= frac{-x}{4-(-x)^2} &= -frac{x}{4-x^2} &= -f(x) end{align*} Thus, the function f(x) is an odd function.

Therefore, the sequence {a_{n}} is an arithmetic sequence with: - First term (a_{1}) = 10 tons - Common difference (d) = 2 tons - Hence, a_{n} = 2n + 8. 2. **Calculating Total Discharged Wastewater**: The total discharged wastewater by the nth month can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence, S_{n} = frac{n}{2}[2a_{1} + (n-1)d]. Substituting a_{1} = 10 and d = 2, we get: S_{n} = frac{n}{2}[20 + 2(n-1)] = frac{n}{2}[2n + 8] 3. **Setting Up the Inequality**: The factory starts with 800 tons of wastewater and adds 2 tons each month.

Each sum inside parentheses is the summation of an arithmetic progression. Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) terms of an arithmetic series (frac{n(n+1)}{2}), we solve: [ frac{2018 + 1}{2} cdot 2018 + frac{2017 + 1}{2} cdot 2017 + frac{2016 + 1}{2} cdot 2016 + ldots + frac{(2019 - k) + 1}{2} cdot (2019 - k) + ldots + frac{2 + 1}{2} cdot 2 + 1 ] 6.

Together, they can complete (1/20 + 1/10) of the task in one day. Simplifying this, we get: 1/20 + 1/10 = 1/20 + 2/20 = 3/20 of the task per day.

Assuming that an employee either always lies or always tells the truth, find how many employees are there in the enterprise.","completion":"1. Let there be ( n ) people in the enterprise. Each employee makes two claims: - (i) Less than 12 employees have a more difficult job. - (ii) At least 30 employees take a higher salary. 2. We need to determine the number of employees ( n ) such that the conditions hold true for either all truth-tellers or all liars. 3. **Claim:** In the top 30 people for salary, they are all liars. - **Proof:** Assume that there is a truth-teller in that group. Then they say \\"at least 30 people have a higher salary than me,\\" which implies that there are 30 people above them in salary. This is a contradiction because we assumed that this is at most 29. Therefore, the claim is proven. 4. Consequently, the bottom ( n-30 ) people for salary are all truth-tellers because they truthfully say that at least 30 people have a higher salary. 5. Since the top 30 people in salary all lie about (i), we must have that there are at least 12 people above the employee that works the most difficult job in the top 30 salary. This means that there are at least 12 people outside of the top 30 salary, so there are at least ( 30 + 12 = 42 ) people in total. 6. Since the bottom ( n-30 ) people all tell the truth about (i), the lowest difficulty worker in that group must have at most 11 people above them, so there are at most 12 people in this group. Thus, there are at most ( 30 + 12 = 42 ) people in total. 7. Therefore, ( 42 ge n ge 42 ), which implies ( n = 42 ). 8. **Construction:** - Consider the following leaderboard for salary and difficulty: - Salary (highest to lowest): ( E_{42}, E_{41}, E_{40}, dots, E_1 ). - Difficulty (highest to lowest): ( E_1, E_2, E_3, dots, E_{41}, E_{42} ). - ( E_i ) is a truth-teller for ( i = 1, 2, dots, 12 ), and a liar for ( i = 13, 14, 15, dots, 42 ). 9. Verification: - For ( i = 1, 2, dots, 12 ): - ( E_i ) tells the truth about (i) because only ( i-1 < 12 ) people work a more difficult job. - They tell the truth about (ii) because ( 42-i ge 30 ) people have a higher salary. - For ( i = 13, 14, dots, 42 ): - ( E_i ) lies about (i) because there are ( i-1 ge 12 ) people that work a more difficult job. - They lie about (ii) because there are ( 42-i < 30 ) people that have a higher salary.

Find the largest interesting number.","completion":"1. **Problem Understanding:** We need to identify the largest natural number whose digits, except for the first and last ones, are less than the average of their two neighboring digits. 2. **Mathematical Formulation:** Let ( a_i ) represent the (i)-th digit of the number. According to the problem, for every digit (a_i) (except for the first and last digits), the following condition must be satisfied: [ a_i < frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2} ] Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction, we get: [ 2a_i < a_{i-1} + a_{i+1} ] Rearranging the inequality, we obtain: [ a_i - a_{i+1} < a_{i-1} - a_i ] This implies that the differences ( b_i = a_i - a_{i+1} ) are decreasing. 3. **Constraints on (a_i) and Number of Digits:** To maximize the number while respecting the condition for ( b_i ), we recognize that having many positive differences would lead to an infeasible number sum, i.e., the sum of differences must be less than 10 for (b_i) values. 4. **Sum of Positive Differences:** Consider consecutive positive values for ( b_i ): [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 > 9 ] This would overshoot our digit constraints. Hence, examining this sum condition, we find that we can have at most 7 valid decreasing steps along with 8 total digits. 5. **Constructing the Number:** By aiming to construct the largest possible number under these constraints, the first digit should ideally be 9. The differences ( b_i ) should be as small as possible initially and increase later. 6. **Difference Sequence and Resulting Number:** Following an orderly and feasible increasing sequence of differences: [ 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3 ] Constructing the number from these differences: [ begin{align*} a_1 &= 9 a_2 &= 9 - 3 = 6 a_3 &= 6 - 2 = 4 a_4 &= 4 - 1 = 3 a_5 &= 3 - 0 = 3 a_6 &= 3 - (-1) = 4 a_7 &= 4 - (-2) = 6 a_8 &= 6 - (-3) = 9 end{align*} ] Thus, we obtain the number 96433469.

Determine all initial pile sizes for which Bianca has a winning strategy.","completion":"To determine all initial pile sizes for which Bianca has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the losing positions for Alice. A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position. 1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:** - Alice and Bianca start with 100 marbles split into two piles, say (a) and (b) such that (a + b = 100). - A move consists of choosing a pile and removing a positive integer number of marbles not larger than half the number of marbles in that pile. 2. **Characterizing Losing Positions:** - A position ((a, b)) is losing if any move from this position leaves the opponent in a winning position. - The key insight is that ((a, b)) is a losing position if (frac{a+1}{b+1}) is a power of 2 (including fractions less than 1). 3. **Proof of Characterization:** - From a losing position ((a, b)), any move will change (a+1) or (b+1) by a factor of less than 2. This means that the ratio (frac{a+1}{b+1}) will no longer be a power of 2, thus moving to a winning position. - Conversely, from a winning position, one can always make a move to round off to the nearest power of 2, thus forcing the opponent into a losing position. 4. **Identifying Losing Positions for (a + b = 100):** - We need to find pairs ((a, b)) such that (frac{a+1}{b+1}) is a power of 2. - Let's check the possible pairs: - For ((50, 50)): (frac{50+1}{50+1} = 1), which is (2^0). - For ((67, 33)): (frac{67+1}{33+1} = frac{68}{34} = 2), which is (2^1). - For ((33, 67)): (frac{33+1}{67+1} = frac{34}{68} = frac{1}{2}), which is (2^{-1}). - For ((95, 5)): (frac{95+1}{5+1} = frac{96}{6} = 16), which is (2^4). - For ((5, 95)): (frac{5+1}{95+1} = frac{6}{96} = frac{1}{16}), which is (2^{-4}).

Simplify the equation by subtracting 198x_n from both sides: [ 2x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n+1} ] 4. Rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving x_n: [ x_n - x_{n-1} = x_{n+1} - x_n ] 5.

Is it possible to identify the heaviest and lightest coin in 13 weighings? Given that we need to determine both the heaviest and lightest coin among ten coins, we will detail the steps necessary to achieve this using a balance scale within 13 weighings. 1. **Initial Strategy:** - Observe that a balance scale comparison results in three possible outcomes: the left side being heavier, the right side being heavier, or both sides being equal. Each weighing thus gives us log_2 3 approx 1.58496 bits of information. 2. **Total Information Needed:** - To unambiguously identify the heaviest and lightest coins among 10 coins, we need to sort them partially to identify the lightest and heaviest. - The information required to fully sort 10 coins is log_2(10!) bits. Calculating: [ log_2(10!) = log_2(3628800) approx 12.29 text{ bits} ] - Since each weighing provides approximately 1.58496 bits of information, we need approximately: [ frac{12.29}{1.58496} approx 7.75 ] weighings to fully sort. However, partial sorting is sufficient if our goal is only to identify the heaviest and lightest coins, which usually requires fewer weighings. 3. **Splitting the Coins:** - We can use a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the number of coins. Let's split the coins into two groups of 5 coins each. 4. **Pairwise Comparisons:** - Weighing the five coins against each other will allow us to rank them partially. - First, weighings required to find some bounds: 1. Compare (1,2), (3,4), and then the remaining coin with the lighter coin from (1,2) to form initial pairs and bounds. 2. Continue pairwise comparisons to narrow down the candidates for the heaviest and lightest coins. 5. **Sequential Comparisons:** - After the initial partition, further sequential comparisons can determine the exact heaviest and lightest. 6. **Illustrative Follow-up Weighings:** - Compare (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), (5 vs 6), (1 vs 3), (5 vs 7) and so forth until every coin has been weighed accordingly. - Generally, each comparison helps discard non-heaviest and non-lightest coins progressively. 7. **Counting the Weighings:** - By setting up pairwise comparisons and evaluating outcomes sequentially, the total number of weighings required typically follows a pattern where: - ( n - 1 ) weighings can provide a relatively stronger ranking order. 8. **Conclusion:** - Using this method with careful pairwise comparison and binary division, we can ensure that both the heaviest and lightest coins are identified within the provided 13 weighings.

This simplifies the problem as we can now consider the students' heights as consecutive integers starting from 1 to n. 2. **Claim about the Final Arrangement**: We claim that the arrangement where no further switches are possible is when the students are in descending order of their heights, i.e., n, n-1, n-2, dots, 1. This is because, in this arrangement, no student k has another student k-2 or less standing directly in front of them. 3. **Proof of the Claim**: To prove this, consider any arrangement other than the descending order. There will always exist at least one student k such that the student directly in front of k has height k-2 or less, allowing a switch. This process can continue until the descending order is achieved. 4. **Counting the Maximum Number of Switches**: - **Switching Strategy**: Start with the student of height n and switch them to the front until no more switches are possible. This can be done n-2 times (since n can switch places with n-2, n-3, dots, 1). - **Generalizing for Any Student k**: A student of height k can be switched k-2 times until they reach the position immediately behind the student with height k-1. - **Total Switches for All Students**: Each student k can initiate switches for all taller students k+1, k+2, dots, n. Each of these taller students can be switched k-2 times. 5. **Mathematical Formulation**: - Define x = n-k+2. The total number of switches is given by the sum: [ sum_{x=2}^{n-1} (n-x)(x-1) = sum_{x=1}^{n} (n-x)(x-1) ] - Simplifying the sum: [ sum_{x=1}^{n} x(n+1) - sum_{x=1}^{n} n - sum_{x=1}^{n} x^2 = frac{n(n+1)^2}{2} - n^2 - frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} ] - Further simplification leads to: [ frac{3n(n^2+1)}{6} - frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = frac{n(n^2-3n+2)}{6} = frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = binom{n}{3} ] 6. **Conclusion**: The maximum number of switches that can be made before reaching a position where no further switches are possible is binom{n}{3}.

Substitute the factored expressions back into the equation: [ 2y^2 = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1) ] 6. Since ( 2y^2 ) is an even number, ( (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1) ) must also be even. This implies that ( x ) must be an odd integer (because the product of an even number of even factors, but not all factors even, would be odd, contradicting the evenness on both sides). Consequently, if ( x ) is odd, let: [ x = 2x' + 1 ] for some integer ( x' ). 7.

Now, let's calculate the amount of watermelon juice.

We need to prove that the triangle cannot be divided into two equal parts. For simplicity, assume that the triangle is divided by a line segment (AD), intersecting side (BC) at point (D), resulting in two smaller triangles, (ABD) and (ADC). 2. **Case Analysis (Angle Equality)**: Suppose the triangles (ABD) and (ADC) are equal in area and share a common vertex (A). - **Case 1**: ( angle B = angle C ) - For ( angle B ) to be equal to ( angle C ), triangle (ABC) must be isosceles with (AB = AC). However, since (ABC) is a scalene triangle by hypothesis, this assumption leads to a contradiction. Hence, ( angle B neq angle C). 3. **Isosceles Triangle Condition**: Suppose an isosceles triangle (ADC) is formed with (AD = DC). - **Case 2**: ( angle CAD = angle ADB ) - If (AD) divides ( angle BAC ) such that ( angle CAD = angle ADB ), it implies that (AD = DC) because ( C widehat{A} = D widehat{A}). This means triangle (ADC) would be isosceles. Since (ADC) is given to be part of a scalene triangle (ABC), this again leads to a contradiction. - **Case 3**: ( angle ABD = angle ADC ) - If ( angle ABD = angle ADC ), then (AB = AC), implying that (ABC) is not scalene, which again contradicts the given condition. 4. **Conclusion**: In all possible cases where triangles (ABD) and (ADC) are assumed to be of equal area, we end up contradicting the initial condition that triangle (ABC) is scalene. Therefore, it is impossible for a scalene triangle to be divided into two equal triangles by a single line segment.

Let f′(x)=0, then by the problem statement, we have ln x=2ax-1 with two solutions x_{1}, x_{2}. This is equivalent to saying that the function g(x)=ln x+1-2ax has exactly two zeros, which implies that the unique extremum of g'(x) in (0,+infty) is not equal to 0. Next, we compute the derivative of g(x), which is g'(x)= dfrac {1}{x}-2a= dfrac {1-2ax}{x}. 1. When aleqslant 0, we have g′(x) > 0, so f′(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, g(x)=f′(x) has at most one zero, which does not align with the problem statement, so this case should be discarded. 2. When a > 0, let g′(x)=0, and we find x= dfrac {1}{2a}. - For xin(0, dfrac {1}{2a}), g′(x) > 0, so the function g(x) is monotonically increasing. - For xin( dfrac {1}{2a},+infty), g′(x) < 0, so the function g(x) is monotonically decreasing. Thus, x= dfrac {1}{2a} is the maximum point of the function g(x), and g( dfrac {1}{2a}) > 0, which implies ln dfrac {1}{2a}+1-1=-ln (2a) > 0. Consequently, ln (2a) < 0, and so 0 < 2a < 1, or equivalently, 0 < a < dfrac {1}{2}. Hence, when 0 < a < dfrac {1}{2}, g(x)=0 has two roots, x_{1}, x_{2}, and x_{1} < dfrac {1}{2a} < x_{2}. Also, g(1)=1-2a > 0, which means x_{1} < 1 < dfrac {1}{2a} < x_{2}. Thus, the function f(x) is decreasing on the interval (0,x_{1}), increasing on (x_{1},x_{2}), and decreasing on (x_{2},+infty).

This problem tests the ability to use derivatives to study function extremes and requires both reasoning and computational skills, making it a challenging question."},{"prompt":"Wendy bought some new chairs and 4 new tables for her house.

The new expenditure will be: New Expenditure = New Price per kg * New Quantity New Expenditure = Rs. 7.50 * Y Since the person wants no increase in his expenditure on sugar, we can equate the initial expenditure to the new expenditure: Rs. 6 * X = Rs. 7.50 * Y Now, we need to find the value of Y in terms of X: Y = (Rs. 6 * X) / Rs. 7.50 Y = (6/7.5) * X Y = (4/5) * X Y = 0.8 * X This means the person will have to reduce his consumption to 80% of the initial consumption to maintain the same expenditure.

This implies that f(-x - 1) = -f(x - 1). Also, since f(x) is even, we have f(-x) = f(x), which leads to f(-x - 1) = f(x + 1). From these equalities, we can deduce that f(x + 1) = -f(x - 1). Now let's consider the periodicity derived from this property. We can write: f((x - 1) + 4) = -f((x - 1) + 2) = f(x - 1). From this, we find that f(x + 4) = f(x), showing that the function f(x) has a period of 4. Given that f(x) is even before the shift and f(x - 1) is odd after the shift, for all x in mathbb{R}, we can assert that f(-1) = f(1) = f(3) = 0. Furthermore, because the function is even, f(0) = -f(-2) = -f(2) = 1. Now, consider the sum f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ldots + f(2006). Since f(x) is periodic with a period of 4, we can pair up terms in the sequence that would result in zeros when summed; for instance, f(1) + f(3) = 0. Splitting the entire sum into groups of four, we have: sum_{n=1}^{2006} f(n) = 501 cdot (f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4)) + f(1) + f(2), where we have used 501 groups because there are 2004 terms, which is 501 times 4, and the remaining f(2005) and f(2006) terms are not added since they would be equal to f(1) and f(2) respectively due to the periodicity, thus summing to zero. Now that we have f(2) = -1 and f(1) = f(3) = 0, the sum reduces to: 501 cdot (0 - 1 + 0 + 1) + 0 - 1 = -1.

To understand the change in the surface area of the pyramid with base ( L_{1} ) and apex moving along ( L_{2} ), we utilize symmetry about the perpendicular bisector planes of the edges ( A_{2} B_{2} ) and ( A_{2} D_{2} ). 3. Focus on the section where the apex ( M ) traverses between points ( E ) and ( F ), where ( E ) is the midpoint of ( A_{2} D_{2} ) and ( F ) is the midpoint of ( A_{2} B_{2} ). It's sufficient to restrict our analysis to the segment ( A_{2} F ); by swapping ( a ) and ( b ), the results for segment ( A_{2} E ) can be derived. 4. The base ( L_{1} ) remains constant, as do the lateral faces ( M A_{1} B_{1} ) and ( M C_{1} D_{1} ). Their areas remain constant since ( M ) moves parallel to ( A_{1} B_{1} ) and ( C_{1} D_{1} ). 5.

Consider the polynomial ( P(x) = x^p + px^k + px^l + 1 ) where ( p ) is a prime number, ( p geq 5 ), and ( k > l ) with ( k, l in {1, 2, ldots, p-1} ). 2. To determine the irreducibility of ( P(x) ) in ( mathbb{Z}[x] ), we first apply the Rational Root Theorem. According to this theorem, if ( P(x) ) has a rational root, it must be an integer that divides the constant term, which is 1. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ( x = 1 ) and ( x = -1 ). 3. **Case 1: ( x = 1 )** [ P(1) = 1^p + p cdot 1^k + p cdot 1^l + 1 = 1 + p + p + 1 = 2 + 2p ] Since ( p geq 5 ), ( 2 + 2p ) is clearly not zero. Therefore, ( x = 1 ) is not a root of ( P(x) ). 4. **Case 2: ( x = -1 )** [ P(-1) = (-1)^p + p(-1)^k + p(-1)^l + 1 ] Since ( p ) is an odd prime, ( (-1)^p = -1 ). Thus, [ P(-1) = -1 + p(-1)^k + p(-1)^l + 1 = p(-1)^k + p(-1)^l ] For ( P(-1) ) to be zero, we need: [ p(-1)^k + p(-1)^l = 0 implies (-1)^k + (-1)^l = 0 ] This implies that ( (-1)^k ) and ( (-1)^l ) must be of opposite signs, i.e., ( k ) and ( l ) must have opposite parities (one is even and the other is odd). 5. We need to count the number of pairs ( (k, l) ) such that ( k ) and ( l ) have opposite parities. There are ( frac{p-1}{2} ) even numbers and ( frac{p-1}{2} ) odd numbers in the set ( {1, 2, ldots, p-1} ). 6. The number of ways to choose one even number and one odd number is: [ left( frac{p-1}{2} right) times left( frac{p-1}{2} right) = left( frac{p-1}{2} right)^2 ] 7. Since ( k > l ), we need to consider the order of selection. For each pair ( (k, l) ) where ( k ) and ( l ) have opposite parities, there are two possible orders: ( (k, l) ) and ( (l, k) ). Therefore, we divide by 2 to avoid double-counting: [ frac{1}{2} left( frac{p-1}{2} right)^2 = frac{(p-1)^2}{8} ] 8.

Since the fractional part of this sum must be an integer (specifically, 0 because the sum of fractional parts is 2, a whole number), we conclude that p mid r(a+b+c+d).

This implies that for each r, two of the numbers ra, rb, rc, rd are in one residue class modulo p and the other two are in another residue class modulo p. 4. **Pairwise sums**: Since two of the numbers ra, rb, rc, rd must fall into one residue class and the other two into another, this implies that there are at least two pairs among a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d that are congruent to 0 modulo p.

Therefore, we can express the probability of a score between 80 and 120 as: P(80 < ξ ≤ 120) = 2 times 0.35 = 0.70. To find the probability of scoring above 120, we utilize the fact that the normal distribution's total probability is equal to 1. The proportion of scores between 80 and 120 is 0.70; thus, the proportion of scores not in this range is 1 - 0.70 = 0.30.

The main condition given is that if any peasant has at least half of the total sheep (i.e., 64 sheep), the others will redistribute the sheep such that each of them gets as many sheep as they already have. The number of redistributions (rakulachivaniya) is 7. 2. **After the First Redistribution**: After the first redistribution, each peasant, except the one being stripped of half or more of their sheep, has a number of sheep that is an even number. To see why, note that the sheep are redistributed by taking equally from the peasant who is being \\"rakulached\\" and distributing them to others. - Let the total number of sheep be T = 128. - If peasant P is selected, and P has sheep S_P geq frac{T}{2}, then other peasants share equally from S_P. 3. **Observing Parity**: Observe that during any redistribution, the resulting number of sheep each peasant has will always be even. Initially, the total number of sheep is even, and as each redistribution affects the parity among the remaining peasants, they maintain an even count. 4. **Iterating Over Multiple Redistributions**: Since each redistribution results in even numbers, after the second redistribution, each of these even numbers is redistributed again. They form multiples of 4. 5. **Generalizing to Further Redistributions**: After the third redistribution, each count will be a multiple of 2^3 = 8. This process continues such that after the n-th redistribution: 2^n. 6. **After the Seventh Redistribution**: Therefore, after the seventh redistribution, each peasant’s sheep count becomes a multiple of 2^7 = 128. Given that only 128 sheep are in total and distributed in integer units, it logically follows the only possible count each peasant can have is 128 or 0. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, one peasant must have 128 sheep, and all others have 0 sheep since no other distribution respects the given condition after seven redistributions.

Let's go through the detailed steps on how this example works. 1. **Establish Initial Conditions:** Let (N = 2) and (M = 1008). We need to investigate whether adding (1008) multiple times to (2) will result in numbers maintaining the same digit sum properties. 2. **Understand the Modulo Operation:** Notice that (M) is a multiple of (16) because (1008 div 16 = 63), which is an integer. Therefore, all the numbers resulting from adding (M) to (N) multiple times will have a decimal representation such that the sum of digits is ( equiv N pmod{16}). 3. **Sum Conservation in Modulo Operation:** Since (N = 2), we must show if ((2 + k cdot 1008) ,text{mod}, 16) ever yields a digit sum adding the same as (N): [ (2 + k cdot 1008) mod 16 implies 2 mod 16 = 2. ] 4. **Possibilities for Sum of Digits:** The numbers that we will generate are congruent to (2 mod 16). These numbers need to be explored for their digit sums. We need the digit sums to add up (2 mod 9) since the digit sum property remains true under modulo (9) for checking these sums against the base (N). 5. **Arithmetic and Powers of 10 Modulo 16:** Consider digits' positions and place values in base 10: [ begin{align*} 10^0 &equiv 1 mod 16, 10^1 &equiv 10 mod 16, 10^2 &equiv 4 mod 16, 10^3 &equiv 8 mod 16, 10^4 &equiv 1 mod 16, quad text{(repeats every 4 digits cycle)}. end{align*} ] For resulting numbers in form (2 + k cdot 1008 ), potential sums are derived from combinations of place values. 6. **Determine if (2) Can Be Derived Differently:** - Single digit derived sum (2) happens for number (2). - (10 + 8 - 16 rightarrow 2) gives us another number (1010), which repeats every cycle due to modulo (16) behavior. Finally, since the viable digit sums retaining modulo condition are limited and do not fit broad ranges, hence recalculating while our scope remains within the digit modulus boundaries only yields repeating sequences of 2 and modular constraints concrete the conclusion not adding further variety besides (N) itself unaltered. **Conclusion:** Petya will not necessarily get other numbers with the same digit sum properties as (N = 2) beyond (N) or its exact computed cyclic repeat within digit sum invariance.

This implies: 5. **Contradiction**: This presents a contradiction because: [ -1 equiv 1 mod p quad text{(for } p not= 2 text{)} ] As a result, it is impossible, therefore confirming that the equation has no strictly positive integer solution. 6. **Finding Negative Solutions**: To find solutions in (mathbb{Z}) aside from the trivial solution (x = y = z = 0): - Setting (x = -1), [ 4(-1)y - (-1) - y = z^2 ] This simplifies to: [ -5y + 1 = z^2 ] By choosing (z = 5k + 1), we get: [ z^2 = (5k + 1)^2 = 25k^2 + 10k + 1 ] Substituting back to find (y): [ -5y + 1 = 25k^2 + 10k + 1 Rightarrow y = -5k - 2 ] Hence, any triple ((-1, -5k - 2, 5k + 1)) is a solution. **Conclusion**: The equation does not admit strictly positive integer solutions, but it admits an infinite number of solutions in (mathbb{Z}).

Then the circles ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) are related through inversion. Since ( A ) is an intersection point of these circles, ( A ) remains invariant under this inversion. Therefore, ( PA^2 = k ). 4. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Formation:** Notice that ( angle O_1 P_1 P_2 = 90^circ ) since it’s a right angle due to the tangency.

Since ( angle BAC = 60^circ ), the angle bisector also bisects the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles. 2. **Calculate the altitude of the equilateral triangle**: - The altitude from (A) to (BC) bisects (BC), creating two 30-60-90 triangles. - Using the properties of 30-60-90 triangles, the altitude (h) can be expressed as (h = AB cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}): [ h = 3 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} ] - Thus, the point (Q) is the foot of the altitude from (A) to (BC), with (AQ = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}). 3. **Determine the placement and parameters of the circle (omega) with respect to point (A)**: - (omega) has diameter 1, so its radius is ( frac{1}{2} ). - The circle is tangent to the sides (AB) and (AC).

Now, to find the percentage of his salary that he spends on entertainment, we calculate: E% of Rs. 5000 = Rs. 500 E% = (Rs. 500 / Rs. 5000) * 100% E% = (1/10) * 100% E% = 10% Therefore, Rohan spends boxed{10%} of his salary on entertainment."},{"prompt":"f ( x = 5 ), what is the value of ( 3x + 4 )?","completion":"1.

This can happen in two scenarios: - x > 2: This is when x is to the right of 2 on the number line. - x < -2: This is when x is to the left of -2 on the number line. 2. **Formulating the Conditions**: From the above explanation, we can write the conditions as: - x > 2 or x < -2 3. **Comparing with the Given Options**: - Option A: -2 < x < 2 does not satisfy the condition as it lies between -2 and 2, where the absolute value of x is not greater than 2. - Option B: -4 < x leqslant -2 partially satisfies the condition for x < -2, but it does not cover x > 2. - Option C: x > -2 includes values that do not satisfy |x| > 2 when x is between -2 and 2. - Option D: x > 2 perfectly matches one part of the condition, but we need to remember that the full condition is x > 2 or x < -2. However, among the given options, only Option D directly corresponds to a part of the full condition. 4. **Conclusion**: Since we are looking for a sufficient and necessary condition within the given options, and considering the options provided, Option D (x > 2) is the closest match to a part of the full condition. However, it's important to note that the complete condition is x > 2 or x < -2. But based on the options provided and the requirement to choose the best one, we conclude with: boxed{D}"},{"prompt":"( P_1 ) and ( P_3 ) are fixed points.

Show that the sequence converges to a point ( P ) (whose position depends on ( P_2 )). What is the locus of ( P ) as ( P_2 ) varies?","completion":"1. Let ( P_1 ) and ( P_3 ) be fixed points. ( P_2 ) lies on the line perpendicular to ( P_1 P_3 ) through ( P_3 ). 2. The sequence ( P_4, P_5, P_6, ldots ) is defined inductively such that ( P_{n+1} ) is the foot of the perpendicular from ( P_n ) to the line ( P_{n-1} P_{n-2} ). 3. We must show that the sequence ({P_n}) converges to a point ( P ), and we must determine the locus of ( P ) as ( P_2 ) varies. 4. Consider any three consecutive points ( P_n, P_{n+1}, P_{n+2} ). Note that the triangle ( P_{n} P_{n+1} P_{n+2} ) lies inside the triangle ( P_{n-1} P_{n} P_{n+1} ). 5. Each subsequent triangle is nested within the previous one, and the size of the triangles shrinks to zero. Because each triangle is a closed set, there must be exactly one point ( P ) that is in the intersection of all these triangles. Hence, the sequence ( {P_n} ) converges to this point ( P ). 6. Because all the triangles ( P_{n} P_{n+1} P_{n+2} ) are similar (even if their vertices may not correspond in the same order), it implies that ( P ) must lie in a position relative to these triangles such that we can obtain one triangle from another by rotation and expansion about ( P ). 7. Consider the triangle ( P_1 P_2 P_3 ). The triangle ( P_5 P_4 P_6 ) should be similar to ( P_1 P_2 P_3 ), with ( P_4 P_5 ) parallel to ( P_1 P_2 ). Thus, the transformation involving rotation to achieve this must be through (pi), and consequently, ( P ) must lie on the line ( P_1 P_5 ). 8. Similarly, ( P_3 P_4 P_5 ) must be obtained from ( P_1 P_2 P_3 ) by rotation about ( P ) through an angle of ( pi/2 ) and expansion. This transformation implies that we rotate ( P_1 P_5 ) into a perpendicular line through ( P_3 ). 9. Since ( P_1 P ) is perpendicular to ( P_3 P ), ( P ) must lie on the circle with diameter ( P_1 P_3 ). 10. However, not all points on this circle are necessarily points of the locus. To find the exact location of ( P ), consider the geometry of the triangle forms: [ P_3 P_5 = P_3 P_4 cos(alpha) = P_3 P_1 sin(alpha) cos(beta) = frac{1}{2} P_3 P_1 sin(2 alpha) ] Here, (alpha) and (beta) are specific angles determined by the configuration of points. 11. Therefore, the locus of point ( P ) is confined to an arc ( XP_3Y ) on the circle with diameter ( P_1 P_3 ). 12. Angle calculation shows: [ angle XP_1Y = 2 tan^{-1} left(frac{1}{2}right) ] Hence, the chord ( XOY ): [ angle XOY = 4 tan^{-1} left(frac{1}{2}right) approx 106^circ ] Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The locus of } P text{ as } P_2 text{ varies is an arc on the circle with diameter } P_1 P_3 text{ and central angle approximately } 106^circ text{.}} ]"},{"prompt":"f set P={x|3xx^2leq0}, and Q={x||x|leq2}, then Pcap Q= （ ） A: [2，2] B: [2，0] C: [2，3] D: [2，3]","completion":"Solving 3x-x^2leq0, we get xleq0 or xgeq3, thus P={x|xleq0 text{ or } xgeq3}, Solving |x|leq2, we get -2leq xleq2, thus Q={x|-2leq xleq2}, Therefore, Pcap Q={x|-2leq xleq0}.
