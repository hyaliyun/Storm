It\'s bloody, comedic, filled with action and other things. Our main character works between the real world and the underworld, where it\'s always night-time.","completion":"That sounds like a fascinating and engaging premise! A vampire bounty hunter navigating between the real world and the underworld offers a lot of room for dynamic storytelling and character development. The contrast between the two worlds, especially with the underworld being in perpetual night, really plays into the vampire theme nicely. The mix of bloodiness, comedy, and action can cater to various audiences, making your manga appealing on multiple levels. You have a great platform for exploring different facets of the underworld, including the variety of \\"bad guys\\" the protagonist must face, which can range from supernatural beings to morally ambiguous humans. Incorporating characters that sometimes assist the protagonist introduces potential for complex relationships and alliances, adding layers to the narrative. These characters can provide comedic relief, strategic support, or even challenges to the protagonist\'s goals, depending on their nature and motives. To further enrich your manga, you might consider the following: - **Character Backstories**: Delve into the history of your vampire bounty hunter and the key side characters. What led the protagonist to become a bounty hunter? How do they reconcile their vampire nature with their job? What are the backstories of the characters that assist the protagonist? Detailed backstories can make your characters more relatable and multidimensional. - **Moral Ambiguity**: Playing with moral ambiguity, especially in the underworld setting, can add depth to your manga. The protagonist and supporting characters might face ethical dilemmas that challenge their values and goals. - **Unique Abilities**: Given the protagonist is a vampire, exploring unique abilities or limitations that come with that, alongside any additional skills they\'ve acquired as a bounty hunter, can make for interesting plot points and conflicts. - **World-Building**: The differentiation between the real world and the underworld provides a rich canvas for world-building. Consider how these worlds interact, what the rules are in the underworld, and how the perpetual night affects the inhabitants and the protagonist. Your manga has a lot of potentials. Keep developing your ideas, and you may create a truly captivating story. Good luck with your manga! If you have any more details you\'d like to discuss or need advice on fleshing out certain aspects of your story, feel free to ask."},{"prompt":"My main inspiration for this story was Hotline Miami, Hellsing and some other things like the Hitman games and Wolfenstein TNO. The story is set somewhere in the mid 2010s.","completion":"Drawing inspiration from Hotline Miami, Hellsing, Hitman games, and Wolfenstein: The New Order (TNO) can significantly influence the tone, style, and pacing of your manga in exciting ways. Each of these sources brings a distinctive flavor to your narrative—mixing ultra-violence, gothic supernatural elements, strategic stealth, and dystopian resistance into a cohesive plot. Setting your story in the mid-2010s allows for a contemporary feel with relatable technology and society while still being recent enough to feel modern to readers. Here’s how you can incorporate elements from each inspiration: 1. **Hotline Miami**: This game is known for its neon-soaked aesthetic, fast-paced action, and visceral violence, underpinned by a mysterious and compelling narrative. Incorporating this into your manga could mean vivid, dynamic fight scenes, a lean and mean storytelling approach, and perhaps an undercurrent of mystery or psychological twisting regarding your protagonist\'s motivations and backstory. The idea of wearing masks—literal or metaphorical—could play into the identities your characters assume in their roles. 2. **Hellsing**: This brings gothic horror into your vampire theme, with the potential for exploring ancient evils, the supernatural\'s depth, and the blurry line between human and monster. Hellsing\'s influence could inspire the design and abilities of your vampire bounty hunter, especially in terms of power dynamics, moral conflicts, and the dark charisma characteristic of characters like Alucard. 3. **Hitman**: The strategic and stealth elements of the Hitman series can inform how your protagonist approaches targets or navigates both the real world and the underworld. It suggests a level of precision and possibly a code of ethics or a particular set of rules guiding the bounty hunter\'s actions. This influence might also affect the plot structure, where each \\"mission\\" or bounty could unfold like a puzzle with multiple potential outcomes based on the protagonist\'s choices. 4. **Wolfenstein TNO**: This game\'s influence could bring themes of resistance, tyranny, and rebellion into your story, perhaps reflected in the power structures of the underworld. It might also inspire a grittier, more determined and resourceful side to your protagonist, fighting against overwhelming odds not just for bounties but for deeper personal or ideological reasons. Considering these inspirations, your story could weave together the individual and the systemic—personal vendettas, hidden histories, and larger conflicts that define the world(s) your characters inhabit. The mix of ultraviolence, strategic action, gothic horror, and a fight against tyranny creates a rich tapestry for your manga. As you develop your characters and plot, think about how these elements inform the relationships, conflicts, and themes within your story. Each inspiration brings something unique to the table, and balancing them will be key to creating a compelling narrative that resonates with fans of the genres you\'re blending. Given the setting in the mid-2010s, consider how technology, societal issues, and cultural trends of that period could intersect with the more fantastical elements of your story, grounding the supernatural in the real and making your world more immersive and believable. Your manga sounds like it has the potential to be a thrilling, unique, and multi-layered work. Keep refining your ideas and experimenting with how best to blend your influences into something that feels new and exciting."},{"prompt":"привет у меня в unity есть начальный экран и я бы хотел в угол поместить текст с версией проекта","completion":"Привет! Для того чтобы добавить текст с версией проекта на начальный экран в Unity, можно использовать UI систему Unity. Предполагается, что у тебя уже есть сцена для начального экрана.

You stand before a vast crowd in Brasília, filled with a mix of hope, anticipation, and the weighty expectations of millions. You, the newly elected President of Brazil, are about to address the nation for the first time in office. The morning air is ripe with the promise of change and the responsibility of governance. **Morning - The Swearing-In Ceremony** As you prepare for the swearing-in ceremony at the National Congress of Brazil, your mind races through the critical issues facing your administration: the economy\'s steady recovery post-pandemic, the urgent need for environmental protection of the Amazon rainforest, addressing social inequalities, and repositioning Brazil on the global stage. Your speech emphasizes unity, sustainable development, and social justice. You pledge to tackle deforestation and climate change head-on, promise reforms to stimulate economic growth and reduce unemployment, and vow to fight corruption that has plagued Brazil\'s politics for too long. **Afternoon - First Actions in Office** Back at Palácio do Planalto, the Presidential office, you convene your first cabinet meeting. The diverse faces around the table represent Brazil\'s complex tapestry — economists, environmentalists, social activists, and experienced politicians. You strike a balance, aiming to leverage their expertise while pushing forward your ambitious agenda. 1. **Economic Policy**: Your first executive order aims to boost the economy by investing in infrastructure, targeting both job creation and addressing long-standing logistical bottlenecks that hamper Brazil\'s agricultural and mining exports. You discuss with your Minister of the Economy the feasibility of introducing tax incentives for renewable energy projects to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. 2. **Environmental Initiative**: Recognizing the urgency of protecting the Amazon, you launch an initiative to combat deforestation, proposing stricter penalties for illegal logging and a reforestation plan. This move requires navigating the complex relations with local businesses, indigenous communities, and international environmental groups. You direct your Minister of the Environment to prepare for a meeting with leaders of Amazonian states to align efforts. 3. **Foreign Policy Maneuver**: With an eye on global geopolitics, you plan your first state visits. Strengthening ties with neighboring Latin American countries is a priority, aiming for a unified stance on environmental protection and trade. You also note the importance of engaging with China, the European Union, and the United States, balancing Brazil\'s trade interests with diplomatic tact. **Evening - Addressing the Nation** Your day ends with a televised address to the nation. Brazilians from all walks of life listen intently as you outline your vision. You stress that the path ahead will require sacrifice and collaboration but remind everyone that Brazil is no stranger to overcoming challenges. You announce the introduction of a social welfare program designed to support the poorest and most vulnerable, ensuring no Brazilian is left behind in the nation\'s march toward prosperity. This, you explain, will be funded by tackling tax evasion and illicit finance, a nod to your campaign promise of fighting corruption. **The Personal Touch** As the day closes, you reflect on the immense tasks ahead. Your personal commitment to seeing Brazil thrive is clear—you plan regular visits across the country, from the bustling favelas of Rio to the remote communities in the Amazon, to ensure your policies are grounded in the realities of all Brazilians.

It is intended to serve as a foundational briefing to inform your policy-making decisions. --- **GDP Performance** - **2022 Estimates for GDP**: Brazil\'s Gross Domestic Product is estimated at approximately 1.6 trillion USD, positioning Brazil as the largest economy in South America and one of the top 15 globally. - **GDP Growth**: Preliminary estimates suggest an annual GDP growth rate of around 2.5%, a recovery buoyed by post-pandemic fiscal stimuli and commodity export increases. However, this rate is subject to revision based on global economic shifts and internal productivity advances. **Inflation and Monetary Policy** - **Current Inflation Rate**: The inflation rate stands at approximately 8.5%, which is above the Central Bank\'s target range. This has been driven by rising food and energy prices, alongside logistical bottlenecks. - **Interest Rate**: The benchmark interest rate (SELIC) is currently at 13.75% as an aggressive measure to curb inflation, though it poses challenges for domestic borrowing and consumption. **Unemployment Rate** - The current unemployment rate is approximately 9.6%, down from previous highs but still a significant concern. Youth and minority populations are disproportionately affected. **Trade Balance and Foreign Exchange Reserves** - **Trade Balance**: Brazil currently enjoys a trade surplus, attributed to strong export performance in soybeans, iron ore, and crude oil. However, import costs are rising, partially offsetting these gains. - **Foreign Exchange Reserves**: Positioned at around 356 billion USD, providing a robust buffer for currency stabilization efforts. **Public Debt** - **Gross Public Debt**: Estimated at 88.8% of GDP, this remains a critical concern for fiscal sustainability. Efforts to streamline public spending and improve tax collection efficiency are paramount. **Strategic Opportunities** - **Infrastructure Investments**: Targeted investments can address both the unemployment issue and improve overall economic productivity, particularly in transportation and logistics sectors. - **Renewable Energy**: Brazil has the potential to become a global leader in renewable energy. Further development in this sector can attract international investments and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. - **Technology and Innovation**: Investing in technology infrastructure and education can propel Brazil towards a more diversified, knowledge-based economy. **Risks and Challenges** - **Global Economic Volatility**: External shocks, including fluctuating commodity prices and trade tensions, could hinder growth prospects. - **Domestic Social Inequalities**: Addressing the pervasive inequality is not only a social imperative but crucial for sustainable economic development. - **Environmental Degradation**: Sustainable development models are necessary to balance economic growth with preservation of natural resources, especially the Amazon. **Conclusion** Your administration inherits an economy with a solid foundation but facing both short-term challenges and long-term structural hurdles. Strategic policy interventions, particularly in sustainability, innovation, and social inclusion, are recommended to secure resilient and inclusive growth. --- This briefing, while comprehensive, will be supplemented with regular updates as more detailed data becomes available and as global and domestic situations evolve.

While her primary role within the Overwatch team is more aligned with assault and reconnaissance rather than investigative work, considering her character and skills, we can explore how she might fare as a detective. # Strengths that would make Tracer a good detective: 1. **Exceptional agility and speed:** Tracer\'s agility and ability to blink through space would be invaluable for tailing suspects without being spotted and for getting out of potentially dangerous situations quickly. 2. **Time manipulation:** Her ability to rewind time, even by a few seconds, could allow her to correct mistakes made during an investigation, gather evidence quickly before it\'s destroyed, or even prevent a crime from happening. 3. **Determination and courage:** Tracer\'s backstory shows her resilience and determination. These personality traits are essential for a detective, who must persevere through challenging and sometimes dangerous situations. 4. **Team player:** Tracer has proven herself to be an excellent team member, often showing concern for her allies\' well-being. Effective detectives need to work well in a team, especially when coordinating with law enforcement and other specialists. 5. **Observation skills:** Her combat skills indicate a high level of situational awareness, which could translate well to noticing subtle details during investigations. # Potential Weaknesses: 1. **Lack of formal training:** While Tracer is a skilled combatant and tactician, she lacks the formal investigative training that a detective would usually possess, such as forensics, interrogation skills, and knowledge of the law. 2. **Impulsiveness:** Tracer\'s impulsive nature and tendency to jump into action without a fully formed plan could potentially jeopardize investigations or lead to mistakes. 3. **Specialized skill set:** Her skill set is highly specialized for combat and may not directly translate to the more nuanced demands of detective work, such as evidence gathering, analysis, and interviewing techniques. In summary, while Tracer might not have the traditional background or skill set of a detective, her unique abilities, determination, and team spirit could certainly make her a valuable asset in certain investigative scenarios. With the right training and a focus on harnessing her strengths while mitigating her weaknesses, Tracer could potentially make for an unconventional yet effective detective, especially in cases requiring quick action, stealth, and temporal manipulation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Для добавления версии к названию билда в Unity, можно воспользоваться скриптом на C#, который будет собирать проект и автоматически добавлять к названию версию приложения, указанную в настройках проекта (PlayerSettings). Ниже приведен пример такого скрипта: ```csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEditor; using System.IO; public class BuildScript { [MenuItem(\\"Build/Build With Version\\")] public static void BuildGameWithVersion() { // Получаем текущую версию из PlayerSettings string version = PlayerSettings.bundleVersion; // Устанавливаем путь и название файла билда // Например, для Windows string path = EditorUtility.SaveFolderPanel(\\"Choose Location of the Built Game\\", \\"\\", \\"\\"); string name = \\"MyGame_\\" + version + \\".exe\\"; // Устанавливаем дополнительные опции билда BuildPlayerOptions buildPlayerOptions = new BuildPlayerOptions(); buildPlayerOptions.scenes = new[] {\\"Assets/Scene1.unity\\", \\"Assets/Scene2.unity\\"}; // Здесь укажите свои сцены buildPlayerOptions.locationPathName = Path.Combine(path, name); buildPlayerOptions.target = BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64; // Или другую платформу buildPlayerOptions.options = BuildOptions.None; // Запускаем процесс сборки BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer(buildPlayerOptions); } } ``` Этот скрипт нужно поместить в папку `Assets/Editor` вашего проекта Unity. Если такой папки нет, создайте её. Скрипт добавит новый пункт в меню \\"Build\\", называемый \\"Build With Version\\". При выборе этого пункта откроется окно для выбора расположения сборки, и сборка вашего проекта будет выполнена с именем файла, содержащим версию вашего приложения. Не забудьте изменить `buildPlayerOptions.scenes` на пути к сценам вашего проекта, а также `buildPlayerOptions.target` на целевую платформу, для которой вы хотите собрать проект."},{"prompt":"билд у меня собирает CI я бы хотел чтобы само собиралось с таким названием","completion":"Если ваш процесс сборки проекта Unity автоматизирован с помощью системы непрерывной интеграции (Continuous Integration, CI), вам всё равно пригодится подход, основанный на скриптах, чтобы добавить версию к названию билда. Часто CI системы (как Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions и т.д.) позволяют запускать скрипты или команды в процессе сборки. Вам нужно встроить логику определения версии и формирования имени билда в этот процесс. # Использование аргументов командной строки для Unity Unity поддерживает сборку проектов через командную строку, позволяя передавать различные аргументы, включая выполнение методов C# перед сборкой. Используя это, вы можете создать методы, которые Unity вызовет непосредственно из командной строки, для сборки проекта с нужными параметрами. Для примера, рассмотрим, что у вас есть метод сборки в Unity, подобный предыдущему примеру, но модифицированный для запуска из командной строки: ```csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEditor; class BuildCommand { static void PerformBuild() { var args = System.Environment.GetCommandLineArgs(); string path = \\"YourDefaultBuildPath\\"; // Установите путь по умолчанию string version = \\"0.1\\"; // Установите версию по умолчанию // Перебираем аргументы командной строки, чтобы найти наши кастомные for (int i = 0; i < args.Length; i++) { if (args[i] == \\"-buildPath\\") { path = args[i + 1]; } else if (args[i] == \\"-buildVersion\\") { version = args[i + 1]; } } string name = \\"MyGame_{version}.exe\\"; // Формируем имя файла с версией BuildPlayerOptions buildPlayerOptions = new BuildPlayerOptions(); buildPlayerOptions.scenes = new[] { \\"Assets/Scene1.unity\\", \\"Assets/Scene2.unity\\" }; // Настройте ваши сцены buildPlayerOptions.locationPathName = System.IO.Path.Combine(path, name); buildPlayerOptions.target = BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64; // Настройте целевую платформу buildPlayerOptions.options = BuildOptions.None; BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer(buildPlayerOptions); } } ``` Для запуска этого скрипта из вашего CI, вы можете использовать команду Unity в командной строке, добавляя кастомные параметры `-buildPath` и `-buildVersion`, например: ```bash Unity -quit -batchmode -projectPath \\"your_project_path\\" -executeMethod BuildCommand.PerformBuild -buildVersion \\"1.0.0\\" -buildPath \\"/path/to/build\\" ``` Убедитесь, что замените `\\"your_project_path\\"`, `\\"/path/to/build\\"`, и `\\"1.0.0\\"` на соответствующие значения для вашего проекта и желаемой версии. Этот подход позволяет вам динамически устанавливать параметры сборки прямо из вашей CI системы, включая версию приложения, что гарантирует, что каждый собранный билд будет иметь правильное наименование с версией."},{"prompt":"можно ли это сделать без командной строки чтобы при сборки вызвался скрипт и в конце названия папки где находится билд установилась версия","completion":"Да, это возможно сделать, создав скрипт на C#, который будет автоматически срабатывать при сборке проекта в Unity и добавлять к имени папки, где находится билд, версию проекта. Данный подход требует использования функционала Unity, связанного с событиями сборки, через интерфейс `IPreprocessBuildWithReport` или `IPostprocessBuildWithReport` из пространства имен `UnityEditor.Build`. Ниже приведен пример такого скрипта, который изменяет путь сборки, добавляя к нему версию проекта. Скрипт должен находиться в папке `Assets/Editor` вашего проекта Unity: ```csharp using UnityEditor; using UnityEditor.Build; using UnityEditor.Build.Reporting; using UnityEngine; public class AddVersionToBuildPath : IPreprocessBuildWithReport { public int callbackOrder { get { return 0; } } public void OnPreprocessBuild(BuildReport report) { // Получаем версию из настроек проекта string version = PlayerSettings.bundleVersion; // Определяем новый путь для сборки (в этом примере, добавляем версию к названию папки с билдом) string newPath = report.summary.outputPath + \\"_v\\" + version; // Здесь можно добавить логику для изменения пути сборки // Однако Unity не позволяет напрямую менять outputPath в этом хуке, // поэтому если вы хотите изменить имя директории сборки, // вам нужно будет вручную обрабатывать ваш путь и возможно использовать // другие методы для копирования собранного билда в новое место после сборки Debug.Log(\\"Новый путь сборки: \\" + newPath); // ВАЖНО: Unity не позволяет напрямую изменить outputPath в этом методе, // поэтому для реального изменения пути сборки вышеуказанные строки служат лишь примером. // Вам нужно будет организовать перемещение собранных данных после сборки в IPostprocessBuildWithReport. } } ``` Так как непосредственно изменить путь сборки в `OnPreprocessBuild` невозможно, вы можете использовать `IPostprocessBuildWithReport` для перемещения собранного проекта в нужную директорию уже после завершения сборки: ```csharp using System.IO; using UnityEditor.Build; using UnityEditor.Build.Reporting; using UnityEditor; class PostBuildStep : IPostprocessBuildWithReport { public int callbackOrder { get { return 1; } } public void OnPostprocessBuild(BuildReport report) { string version = PlayerSettings.bundleVersion; string newPath = report.summary.outputPath + \\"_v\\" + version; // Может понадобиться проверить, был ли билд собран в поддиректорию (например, для Windows) // и соответственно адаптировать путь // Проверяем, существует ли конечная директория, если нет, то создаем if (!Directory.Exists(newPath)) { Directory.CreateDirectory(newPath); } // Перемещаем собранные файлы // ВНИМАНИЕ: Необходимо детально указать, какие файлы и как перемещать, // данная строка лишь иллюстрирует задумку FileUtil.MoveFileOrDirectory(report.summary.outputPath, newPath); Debug.Log(\\"Билд был перемещен в: \\" + newPath); } } ``` Этот метод будет автоматически вызван после сборки проекта, и вы можете использовать его для изменения пути билда, реализовав логику перемещения собранных файлов в новую директорию, имя которой будет содержать версию проекта. Однако, применение подобных подходов требует аккуратности с обработкой путей, особенно если сборка проекта включает различные типы файлов и структуру директорий. Всегда проверяйте результат в различных условиях сборки вашего проекта."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[RequireComponent(typeof(SpriteRenderer))] public class AdjustSortingLayer : MonoBehaviour { private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer; void Awake() { // 获取SpriteRenderer组件 spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); } // 调用此方法来改变GameObject的Sorting Layer public void ChangeSortingLayer(string layerName, int orderInLayer) { spriteRenderer.sortingLayerName = layerName; spriteRenderer.sortingOrder = orderInLayer; } } ``` 在这个简单的脚本中，`ChangeSortingLayer()`方法允许你指定新的`Sorting Layer`名称和`Order in Layer`值来调整GameObject的渲染顺序。 # 使用示例 如果你想在特定事件或条件下调用这个方法，可以从其他脚本中引用并调用它，例如： ```csharp // 其他脚本中 public class GameController : MonoBehaviour { public AdjustSortingLayer adjustSortingLayerScript; void SomeEventOrCondition() { // 当某个事件或条件被满足时，改变Sorting Layer adjustSortingLayerScript.ChangeSortingLayer(\\"Foreground\\", 5); } } ``` 在这个例子中，`GameController`代表可能控制游戏流程的脚本。当达到某个条件或事件被触发时，它会调用`AdjustSortingLayer`脚本的`ChangeSortingLayer()`方法，动态地调整GameObject的`Sorting Layer`和`Order in Layer`。 确保在Unity编辑器中将带有`AdjustSortingLayer`脚本的GameObject拖拽到`GameController`脚本的`adjustSortingLayerScript`字段中，以便`GameController`脚本可以访问和控制它。 这种方式让你能够根据游戏的不同阶段或逻辑需要，灵活地调整游戏对象的渲染层次，帮助创建更丰富和动态的游戏世界。"},{"prompt":"屏蔽发言用英语怎么说","completion":"屏蔽发言可以用英语表达为 \\"mute speech\\" 或 \\"silence speech\\"。在在线社区或社交媒体的上下文中，更常见的表达可能是 \\"mute someone\\" 或 \\"block someone\'s comments/posts\\"，意指禁止某人发言或屏蔽某人的评论/帖子。"},{"prompt":"是否被屏蔽用英语怎么说","completion":"被屏蔽可以用英语表达为 \\"be muted\\" 或 \\"be blocked\\"。具体使用哪个表达方式取决于上下文，例如： - 在社交媒体上，如果某人无法再看到另一用户的帖子或消息，可以说 \\"I have been blocked by that user\\"（我被那个用户屏蔽了）。 - 在线上会议或聊天中，如果某人的话筒被关闭，使得他们无法发言，可以说 \\"I have been muted\\"（我被禁言了）。"},{"prompt":"using System.Collections;

public UnityEvent m_onRightPressDown; ``` 接着，你可以在`Update`方法中检测鼠标左右键的按下事件，并触发相应的`UnityEvent`。因为原先的类设计主要处理触摸事件，我们这里新增一个用于鼠标事件检测的方法： ```csharp protected void MouseUpdate() { // 检测鼠标左键按下 if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { m_onLeftPressDown.Invoke(); OnMouseLeftPressDown(); } // 检测鼠标右键按下 if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1)) { m_onRightPressDown.Invoke(); OnMouseRightPressDown(); } } // 对应于鼠标左键按下的虚拟方法 protected virtual void OnMouseLeftPressDown() { } // 对应于鼠标右键按下的虚拟方法 protected virtual void OnMouseRightPressDown() { } ``` 然后，在你的`VirutalUpdate`(如果这里本意是`VirtualUpdate`，则可能是笔误)方法或更适合的地方调用`MouseUpdate`方法： ```csharp protected override void VirutalUpdate() { base.VirutalUpdate(); MouseUpdate(); if (Interacting) { m_onPress.Invoke(); OnPress(); } } ``` 这样，你就能够同时处理触摸事件和区分鼠标左右键的事件了。这种方法允许你将鼠标特定的逻辑添加到你的`Clickable`类中，同时保留其原有的触摸交互功能。记得根据你的实际逻辑需求调整上述示例代码。"},{"prompt":"糖醋大蒜会变质吗","completion":"糖醋大蒜是一种特别的做法，通过糖醋浸泡能有效延长大蒜的保质期。糖和醋都有防腐性质，可以减缓微生物的生长，从而使大蒜更耐储存。但是，尽管糖醋有保护作用，糖醋大蒜在一定条件下还是可能会变质的。 影响糖醋大蒜变质的因素包括： 1. **保存温度**：高温会加速微生物生长，虽然酸性环境会限制大部分细菌的生长，但是如果温度过高，还是可能发生变质。 2. **密封情况**：如果密封不良，那么空气中的微生物容易侵入容器内，促使大蒜变质。 3. **污染**：在制作过程中，如果使用的器具或材料有污染，也可能引入微生物，加速变质。 4. **大蒜和醋的质量**：初始使用的大蒜如果不新鲜或者醋的酸度不足，也可能减弱防腐效果。 因此，虽然糖醋大蒜相对来说更耐储存，但正确的制作方法、储存条件（如冷藏）、避免直接用手取用、保持容器清洁密封，都是延长其保质期的关键。如果发现糖醋大蒜有异味、颜色变化或霉变，这些都是变质的迹象，应该避免食用。"},{"prompt":"变绿说明什么","completion":"如果糖醋大蒜发生变绿的现象，这可能是由于以下几个原因： 1. **化学反应**：大蒜中的硫化合物在特定条件下可以与醋中的酸反应，生成绿色物质。这种变化可能发生在某些特定的pH值或温度条件下。虽然变绿的大蒜在外观上可能不太吸引人，但这并不一定意味着它已经变质或不安全食用。 2. **照光作用**：长时间暴露在光线下，大蒜中的某些成分如硫化合物可能发生化学反应，产生绿色素。这与洋葱在光照下会变绿的原理类似。 3. **微生物活动**：虽然相对不常见，但在某些不理想的储存条件下，微生物（如某些细菌或真菌）的生长可能导致大蒜颜色变化。然而，由于糖醋液提供了相对抑制微生物生长的环境，这种情况较为罕见。 通常情况下，变绿的大蒜主要是因为无害的化学反应或光照影响，不一定表示大蒜已经变质或不安全。但如果伴随有其他变质迹象，如有异味、霉变或细菌生长的迹象，那么为了安全起见，应该避免食用。对于糖醋大蒜，维持适当的储存条件（如避光、冷藏）和良好的卫生条件是避免变质和保持品质的关键。"},{"prompt":"怎么断定糖醋打算不合适食用","completion":"判断糖醋大蒜不合适食用可以依据以下几个方面来进行： 1. **异味**：糖醋大蒜如果发生变质，可能会产生不正常的气味，如发酵、腐败或其他难闻的气味。这是最直观的变质迹象之一。 2. **颜色变化**：虽然大蒜变绿在某些情况下可能是正常的化学反应，但如果大蒜出现其他不正常的颜色变化，如变黑或出现白色、黄色、绿色的霉斑，这可能是因为霉菌或细菌生长造成的。 3. **质地变化**：如果大蒜或糖醋液出现异常粘稠、大蒜变得异常软烂，这可能是细菌活动的结果，说明糖醋大蒜可能已不适宜食用。 4. **霉变**：在糖醋大蒜表面或容器内壁看到霉点或霉丝是最明显的变质迹象，表示大蒜已经被微生物污染。 5. **气泡**：如果糖醋液中出现气泡，可能是发酵的迹象，表明微生物活动繁殖，导致产生气体。虽然一些自然发酵食品以此为特点，但对于糖醋大蒜来说，这通常不是预期的结果，应视为变质迹象。 6. **口感**：变质的糖醋大蒜可能会有明显的口感变化，如变得过于软烂或口味异常。如果有任何疑虑，最安全的做法是不要试尝。 如遇到上述任何一个或多个迹象，为了健康安全，建议不要食用这些大蒜。在制作和保存糖醋大蒜时，应确保采取适当的食品安全措施，包括使用清洁的器具，确保大蒜完全被糖醋液覆盖，并储存在适当的条件下，以减少变质的风险。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here\'s a speculative look at how such a change might affect her gameplay, keeping in mind that such changes are hypothetical and based on how weapons typically function in the game: 1. **Range and Damage Profile**: Tracer\'s pulse pistols are designed for short-range combat, encouraging a playstyle that involves getting close to enemies, using her blinks to dodge attacks, and recalling to safety when necessary. A pulse rifle, depending on its exact specifications, could allow Tracer to engage enemies from medium to long range, making her less reliant on closing distance. This could potentially increase her damage output over range but decrease her effectiveness in close-quarters combat unless the rifle is balanced to perform well at all distances. 2. **Playstyle Shift**: Tracer is known for her mobility and her role as a flanker who can dive the backline, disrupt the enemy, and secure kills on key targets before quickly getting out. With a pulse rifle, she might transition to a more traditional DPS role, providing consistent damage from the midfield rather than emphasizing her hit-and-run tactics. This would make positioning and sightlines more critical for Tracer players, as they\'d need to utilize her mobility to secure advantageous shooting positions rather than purely for evasion and engagement. 3. **Ability Synergy**: Tracer\'s abilities, including Blink and Recall, are currently synergized with close combat, allowing her to navigate through enemies, dodge damage, and correct mistakes quickly. With a pulse rifle, the utility of these abilities might shift towards facilitating positional advantages and escape routes rather than aggressive engagement and disengagement, although they would still serve as effective tools for avoiding damage and repositioning. 4. **Impact on Game Meta**: The introduction of a medium to long-range weapon like a pulse rifle to Tracer\'s arsenal could potentially alter team compositions and strategies, as her changed role might necessitate different tactics and support structures. Teams might rely on Tracer for consistent damage output rather than for picking off key targets, which could shift the balance of power among heroes and affect the overall game meta. 5. **Balancing**: Any significant change to a hero\'s weaponry requires careful balancing to ensure that the character remains viable without becoming overpowered or underpowered. Blizzard would need to consider the rifle\'s fire rate, damage per shot, reload speed, and how it interacts with Tracer\'s abilities to find a balance that fits within the overall game dynamics. 6. **Fan Reception**: Tracer\'s identity is closely tied to her current set of abilities and playstyle. A drastic change like replacing her pistols with a pulse rifle might not be well-received by all players, as it would alter one of the game\'s most iconic heroes in a fundamental way. Blizzard would have to weigh the benefits of such a change against the potential backlash or disappointment from the player base. In summary, while the idea of giving Tracer a pulse rifle is intriguing and could offer new gameplay opportunities, it would also represent a significant departure from her current role and capabilities, necessitating adjustments across the game to maintain balance and player satisfaction."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If society is understood as being British, Russian or Mexican society, this obviously gives weight to the view that the state can be the centre point of social transformation. Such an assumption, however, presupposes a prior abstraction of state and society from their spatial surroundings, a conceptual snipping of social relations at the frontiers of the state. The world, in this view, is made up of so many national societies, each with its own state, each one maintaining relations with all the others in a network of inter-national relations. Each state is then the centre of its own world and it becomes possible to conceive of a national revolution and to see the state as the motor of radical change in ‘its’ society. The problem with such a view is that social relations have never coincided with national frontiers. The current discussions of ‘globalisation’ merely highlight what has always been true: capitalist social relations, by their nature, have always gone beyond territorial limitations. Whereas the relation between feudal lord and serf was always a territorial relation, the distinctive feature of capitalism was that it freed exploitation from such territorial limitations, by virtue of the fact that the relation between capitalist and worker was now mediated through money. The mediation of social relations through money means a complete de-territorialisation of those relations: there is no reason why employer and employee, producer and consumer, or workers who combine in the same process of production, should be within the same territory. Capitalist social relations have never been limited by state frontiers, so that it has always been a mistake to think of the capitalist world as being the sum of different national societies (see von Braunmühl 1978 and Holloway 1995b). The web of social relations in which the particular national states are embedded is (and has been since the beginning of capitalism) a global web. The focusing of revolution on the winning of state power thus involves the abstraction of the state from the social relations of which it is part. Conceptually, the state is cut out from the clutter of social relations that surround it and made to stand up with all the appearance of being an autonomous actor. Autonomy is attributed to the state, if not in the absolute sense of reformist (or liberal) theory, then at least in the sense that the state is seen as being potentially autonomous from the capitalist social relations that surround it. But, it might be objected, this is a crude misrepresentation of revolutionary strategy. Revolutionary movements inspired by Marxism have generally seen the winning of state power as just one element in a broader process of social transformation. Moreover, Lenin spoke not just of conquering state power but of smashing the old state and replacing it with a workers’ state, and both he and Trotsky were more than aware that the revolution had to be international to be successful. All this is true, and it is important to avoid crude caricatures, but the fact remains that the capturing of the state has generally been seen as a particularly important element, a focal point in the process of social change,5 one which demands a focusing of the energies devoted to social transformation. The focusing inevitably privileges the state as a site of power. Whether the winning of state power is seen as being the exclusive path for changing society or just as a focus for action, there is inevitably a channelling of revolt. The fervour of those who fight for a different society is taken up and pointed in a particular direction: towards the winning of state power. ‘If we can only conquer the state (whether by electoral or by military means), then we shall be able to change society. First, therefore, we must concentrate on the central goal – conquering state power’: so the argument goes, and the young are inducted into what it means to conquer state power: they are trained either as soldiers or as bureaucrats, depending on how the conquest of state power is understood. ‘First build the army, first build the party, that is how to get rid of the power that oppresses us’: the party-building (or army-building) comes to eclipse all else. What was initially negative (the rejection of capitalism) is converted into something positive (institution-building, power-building). The induction into the conquest of power inevitably becomes an induction into power itself. The initiates learn the language, logic and calculations of power; they learn to wield the categories of a social science which has been entirely shaped by its obsession with power. Differences within the organisation become struggles for power. Manipulation and manoeuvring for power become a way of life. Nationalism is an inevitable complement of the logic of power. The idea that the state is the site of power involves the abstraction of the particular state from the global context of power relations. Inevitably, no matter how much the revolutionary inspiration is guided by the notion of world revolution, the focus on a particular state as the site for bringing about radical social change implies giving priority to the part of the world encompassed by that state over other parts of the world. Even the most internationalist of revolutions oriented towards state power have rarely succeeded in avoiding the nationalist privileging of ‘their’ state over others, or indeed the overt manipulation of national sentiment in order to defend the revolution. The notion of changing society through the state rests on the idea that the state is, or should be, sovereign. State sovereignty is a prerequisite for changing society through the state, so the struggle for social change becomes transformed into the struggle for the defence of state sovereignty. The struggle against capital then becomes an anti-imperialist struggle against domination by foreigners, in which nationalism and anti-capitalism are blended.6 Self-determination and state sovereignty become confused, when in fact the very existence of the state as a form of social relations is the very antithesis of self-determination. (This is an argument that will be developed in a later chapter.) No matter how much lip service is paid to the movement and its importance, the goal of the conquest of power inevitably involves an instrumentalisation of struggle. The struggle has an aim: to conquer political power. The struggle is a means to achieve that aim. Those elements of struggle which do not contribute to the achievement of that aim are either given a secondary importance or must be suppressed altogether: a hierarchy of struggles is established. The instrumentalisation/hierarchisation is at the same time an impoverishment of struggle. So many struggles, so many ways of expressing our rejection of capitalism, so many ways of fighting for our dream of a different society are simply filtered out, simply remain unseen when the world is seen through the prism of the conquest of power. We learn to suppress them, and thus to suppress ourselves. At the top of the hierarchy we learn to place that part of our activity that contributes to ‘building the revolution’, at the bottom come frivolous personal things like affective relations, sensuality, playing, laughing, loving. Class struggle becomes puritanical: frivolity must be suppressed because it does not contribute to the goal. The hier-archisation of struggle is a hierarchisation of our lives and thus a hierarchisation of ourselves. The party is the organisational form which most clearly expresses this hierarchisation. The form of the party, whether vanguardist or parliamentary, presupposes an orientation towards the state and makes little sense without it. The party is in fact a form of disciplining class struggle, of subordinating the myriad forms of class struggle to the overriding aim of gaining control of the state. The fixing of a hierarchy of struggles is usually expressed in the form of the party programme. This instrumentalist impoverishment of struggle is not characteristic just of particular parties or currents (Stalinism, Trotskyism, and so on): it is inherent in the idea that the goal of the movement is to conquer political power. The struggle is lost from the beginning, long before the victorious party or army conquers state power and ‘betrays’ its promises. It is lost once power itself seeps into the struggle, once the logic of power becomes the logic of the revolutionary process, once the negative of refusal is converted into the positive of power-building. And usually those involved do not see it: the initiates in power do not even see how far they have been drawn into the reasoning and habits of power. They do not see that if we revolt against capitalism, it is not because we want a different system of power, it is because we want a society in which power relations are dissolved. You cannot build a society of non-power relations by conquering power. Once the logic of power is adopted, the struggle against power is already lost. The idea of changing society through the conquest of power thus ends up achieving the opposite of what it sets out to achieve. Instead of the conquest of power being a step towards the abolition of power relations, the attempt to conquer power involves the extension of the field of power relations into the struggle against power. What starts as a scream of protest against power, against the dehumanisation of people, against the treatment of humans as means rather than ends, becomes converted into its opposite, into the assumption of the logic, habits and discourse of power into the very heart of the struggle against power.7 For what is at issue in the revolutionary transformation of the world is not whose power but the very existence of power. What is at issue is not who exercises power, but how to create a world based on the mutual recognition of human dignity, on the formation of social relations which are not power relations.”翻译为中文","completion":"这种误解的一个重要方面是，革命（特别是改艺）运动一直倾向于假定“社会”可以理解为一个民族（即国家界限内的）社会。如果社会被理解为英国、俄罗斯或墨西哥社会，这显然支持了国家可以成为社会转型的中心点的观点。然而，这种假设预先假定了从其空间环境中抽象出国家和社会，概念性地在国家边境处剪断社会关系。在这种观点中，世界由许多民族社会组成，每个社会都有自己的国家，每个国家都与所有其他国家在国与国之间的关系网络中维持联系。每个国家在它自己的世界中都是中心，这样就有可能构想一个民族革命，并将国家视为“其”社会中激进变革的推动力。 这种观点的问题在于，社会关系从未与国家边界一致。当前关于“全球化”的讨论只是突出了一个一直是真实的事实：资本主义社会关系的本质一直超越了领土限制。封建领主与农奴之间的关系总是一个领土关系，资本主义的独特之处在于它通过货币介导的形式，将剥削从这种领土限制中解放出来。通过货币介导的社会关系意味着那些关系的完全去领土化：雇主与雇员、生产者与消费者，或在同一生产过程中结合的工人无需处于同一领土内。资本主义的社会关系从未受到国家边界的限制，因此认为资本主义世界是由不同国家社会组成的总和一直是一个错误（参见von Braunmühl 1978和Holloway 1995b）。国家所嵌入的社会关系网络（自资本主义初始至今）是一个全球网络。 因此，聚焦于赢得国家权力的革命涉及到将国家从其所属的社会关系中抽象出来。从概念上讲，国家被从环绕它的社会关系混乱中割裂出来，似乎成为了一个自主行动者。自主性被归于国家，如果不是在改艺（或自由主义）理论的绝对意义上，至少在某种意义上，即国家被视为潜在地从其周围的资本主义社会关系中独立出来。 但是，可能会有人反对称，这是对革命策略的粗暴误解。受马克思主义启发的革命运动通常将赢得国家权力视为社会转型更广泛过程中的一个要素。此外，列宁不仅谈到了夺取国家权力，还谈到了粉碎旧国家并用工人国家取而代之，他和托洛茨基都深知，只有革命是国际性的才能成功。所有这些都是真实的，避免粗暴的简化是重要的，但事实仍然是，夺取国家权力通常被视为社会变革过程中一个特别重要的元素，一个对社会变革精力进行聚焦的焦点。这种聚焦不可避免地将国家视为权力的所在地。 无论赢得国家权力是被视为改变社会的唯一途径还是只是行动的焦点，不可避免地会引导叛乱的引流。那些为不同社会而战的人的热情被集中并指向一个特定的方向：赢得国家权力。“如果我们只能征服国家（无论是通过选举还是通过军事手段），那么我们将能够改变社会。因此，我们首先必须专注于中心目标 - 征服国家权力”：这是争论的走向，年轻人被引导了解什么是征服国家权力的含义：他们被训练成为士兵或官僚，这取决于对征服国家权力的理解。“首先建立军队，首先建立党，这就是摆脱压迫我们的力量的方式”：党的建设（或军建设）开始使所有其他事物相形见绌。最初的否定（对资本主义的拒绝）转变为某种积极性（机构建设，权力建设）。对权力征服的引导不可避免地成为对权力本身的引导。新手们学会了权力的语言、逻辑和计算，他们学会了运用一种完全被对权力的迷恋所塑造的社会科学的范畴。组织内部的分歧变成了权力斗争。操纵和争夺权力成为一种生活方式。 民族主义是权力逻辑不可避免的补充。认为国家是权力所在地涉及从全球权力关系的背景中抽象出特定国家。不可避免地，无论革命的灵感对世界革命的指导如何，聚焦于特定国家作为实现激进社会变革的场所都意味着将该国家所包括的世界部分优先于其他部分。即使是最国际主义的、面向国家权力的革命也很少能成功避免对“他们”的国家而非其他国家的民族主义特权，或者为了保卫革命而公然操纵民族情绪。通过国家改变社会的观念基于一种认为国家是或应该是主权国家的观点。国家主权是通过国家改变社会的前提，因此改变社会的斗争转变为保卫国家主权的斗争。反资本主义斗争因此成为反对外国人统治的反帝国主义斗争，其中民族主义和反资本主义融为一体。自决权和国家主权变得混淆，而事实上国家作为一种社会关系形式恰恰是自决权的对立面。（这是一个将在后面章节中发展的论点。） 不管对运动及其重要性的口头支持有多少，征服权力的目标不可避免地涉及对斗争的工具化。斗争有一个目标：征服政治权力。斗争是实现那个目标的手段。那些不促成实现那个目标的斗争元素要么被赋予次要重要性，要么必须完全被压制：建立了一种斗争的等级制度。工具化/等级化同时也是斗争的贫困化。当世界被通过征服权力的棱镜看待时，如此多的斗争、如此多的表达我们对资本主义的拒绝方式、如此多的为我们梦想中的不同社会而战的方式简单地被过滤掉，简单地变得看不见。我们学会压制它们，从而压制我们自己。在等级制度的顶部，我们学会放置那些有助于“建设革命”的我们的活动部分，在底部是像情感关系、感性、玩耍、笑、爱这样的琐碎的个人事物。阶级斗争变得清教徒式的：因为不助于目标的轻佻必须被压制。斗争的等级制度是我们生活的等级制度，因而是我们自己的等级制度。 党是最清楚地表达这种等级化的组织形式。无论是前卫派还是议会派，党的形式都预设了对国家的取向，没有它就失去意义。党实际上是对阶级斗争的纪律化，是将众多形式的阶级斗争从属于夺取国家控制权这一超越目标的形式。等级制度的固定通常以党纲的形式表达。 这种斗争的工具化贫困化不仅是特定党派或流派（斯大林主义、托洛茨基主义等等）的特征：它固有地存在于运动的目标是征服政治权力的观念中。斗争从一开始就输了，早在胜利的党派或军队征服国家权力并“背叛”其承诺之前就输了。一旦权力本身渗透到斗争中，一旦权力的逻辑成为了革命过程的逻辑，一旦拒绝的否定转变为权力建设的积极性，斗争就已经输了。而且通常那些参与其中的人并不看到这一点：权力的初学者甚至没有意识到他们已经被深深地吸引进权力的推理和习惯中。他们没有意识到，如果我们反抗资本主义，不是因为我们想要一个不同的权力体系，而是因为我们想要一个权力关系被消解的社会。你不能通过征服权力来建立一个非权力关系的社会。一旦采用了权力的逻辑，对权力的斗争就已经输了。 通过征服权力来改变社会的观念因而最终实现了与其设定目标相反的效果。征服权力作为消除权力关系的一步，尝试征服权力涉及将权力关系的领域扩展到对权力的斗争中。从反对权力的抗议尖叫开始，对人的非人化、将人当作手段而不是目的的对待，变成了其相反，将权力的逻辑、习惯和话语引入了对权力斗争的核心。因为，在世界的革命性转变中争论的不是谁的权力，而是权力的存在本身。争论的不是谁行使权力，而是如何创建一个基于人类尊严互认、基于非权力社会关系的世界。"},{"prompt":"请将“It would seem that the most realistic way to change society is to focus struggle on the winning of state power and to subordinate struggle to this end.

This is the powerfully realistic argument of Lenin, especially in What is to be Done?, but it is a logic shared by all the major revolutionary leaders of the twentieth century: Rosa Luxemburg, Trotsky, Gramsci, Mao, Che. Yet the experience of their struggles suggests8 that the accepted realism of the revolutionary tradition is profoundly unrealistic. That realism is the realism of power and can do no more than reproduce power. The realism of power is focused and directed towards an end. The realism of anti-power, or, better, the anti-realism of anti-power, must be quite different if we are to change the world. And change the world we must. 3 Beyond Power? I The world cannot be changed through the state. Both theoretical reflection and a whole century of bad experience tell us so. ‘We told you so’, say the satisfied ones, ‘We said so all along. We said it was absurd. We told you that you couldn’t go against human nature. Give up the dream, give up!’ And millions throughout the world have given up the dream of a radically different type of society. There is no doubt that the fall of the Soviet Union and the failure of national liberation movements throughout the world have brought disillusionment to millions of people. The notion of revolution was so strongly identified with gaining control of the state that the failure of those attempts to change the world through gaining control of the state has led very many people to the conclusion that revolution is impossible. There is a toning down of expectations. For many, hope has evaporated from their lives, giving way to a bitter, cynical reconciliation with reality. It will not be possible to create the free and just society we hoped for, but we can always vote for a centre or left-of-centre party, knowing quite well that it will not make any difference, but at least that way we will have some sort of outlet for our frustration. ‘We know now that we will not be able to change the world’, says one of the characters in a novel by Marcela Serrano. ‘That has been the greatest blow of all for our generation. We lost our objective in the middle of the way, when we still had the age and the energy to make the changes … The only thing that is left is to ask with humility: where is dignity?’1 Is the character in the book not right? If we cannot change the world through the state, then how? The state is just a node in a web of power relations. But will we not be always caught up in the web of power, no matter where we start? Is rupture really conceivable? Are we not trapped in an endless circularity of power? Is the whole world not a spider-web, which can be made a little better here and there? Or perhaps: is the whole world not a multiplicity of spiderwebs, so that just when we have broken through one, we find ourselves entangled in another? Is the idea of a radical otherness not best left to those who comfort themselves with religion, to those who live with a dream of heaven as the reward for living through this vale of tears? The great problem with trying to retreat into a life of private dignity and saying ‘let’s make the best of what we’ve got’ is that the world does not stand still. The existence of capitalism implies a dynamic of development which attacks us constantly, subjecting our lives more directly to money, creating more and more poverty, more and more inequality, more and more violence. Dignity is not a private matter, for our lives are so entwined with those of others that private dignity is impossible. It is precisely the pursuit of personal dignity that, far from taking us in the opposite direction, confronts us fully with the urgency of revolution.2 The only way in which the idea of revolution can be maintained is by raising the stakes. The problem of the traditional concept of revolution is perhaps not that it aimed too high, but that it aimed too low. The notion of capturing positions of power, whether it be governmental power or more dispersed positions of power in society, misses the point that the aim of the revolution is to dissolve relations of power, to create a society based on the mutual recognition of people’s dignity. What has failed is the notion that revolution means capturing power in order to abolish power.3 What is now on the agenda is the much more demanding notion of a direct overcoming of power relations. The only way in which revolution can now be imagined is not as the conquest of power but as the dissolution of power. The fall of the Soviet Union not only meant disillusionment for millions; it also brought the liberation of revolutionary thought, the liberation from the identification of revolution with the conquest of power. This, then, is the revolutionary challenge at the beginning of the twenty-first century: to change the world without taking power. This is the challenge that has been formulated most clearly by the Zapatista uprising in the south-east of Mexico. The Zapatistas have said that they want to make the world anew, to create a world of dignity, a world of humanity, but without taking power.4 The Zapatista call to make the world anew without taking power has found a remarkable resonance. This resonance has to do with the growth in recent years of what might be called an area of anti-power. This corresponds to a weakening of the process by which discontent is focused on the state. This weakening is clear in the case of the would-be revolutionary parties, which no longer have the capacity they once had to channel discontent towards the struggle to seize state power. It is also true of social-democratic parties: whether or not people vote for them, they no longer have the same importance as focuses of political militancy. Social discontent today tends to be expressed far more diffusely, through participation in ‘non-governmental organisations’, through campaigning around particular issues, through the individual or collective concerns of teachers, doctors or other workers who seek to do things in a way that does not objectify people, in the development of autonomous community projects of all sorts, even in prolonged and massive rebellions such as the one taking place in Chiapas. There is a vast area of activity directed towards changing the world in a way that does not have the state as its focus, and that does not aim at gaining positions of power. This area of activity is obviously highly contradictory, and certainly includes many activities that might be described as ‘petty bourgeois’ or ‘romantic’ by revolutionary groups. It is rarely revolutionary in the sense of having revolution as an explicit aim, yet the projection of a radical otherness is often an important component of the activity involved. It includes what is sometimes called the area of ‘autonomy’, but it is far, far wider than that which is usually indicated by the term. It is sometimes, but not always, in open hostility to capitalism, but it does not find and does not seek the sort of clear focus for such activity that was formerly provided by both revolutionary and reformist parties. This is the confused area in which the Zapatista call resonates, the area in which anti-power grows.5 It is an area in which the old distinctions between reform, revolution and anarchism no longer seem relevant, simply because the question of who controls the state is not the focus of attention. There is a loss of revolutionary focus, not because people do not long for a different type of society, but because the old focus proved to be a mirage. The challenge posed by the Zapatistas is the challenge of salvaging revolution from the collapse of the state illusion and from the collapse of the power illusion. But how can we change the world without taking power? Merely to pose the question is to invite a snort of ridicule, a raised eyebrow, a shrug of condescension. ‘How can you be so naïve?’ say some, ‘Do you not know that there can be no radical change in society? Have you learnt nothing in the last thirty years? Do you not know that talk of revolution is silly, or are you still trapped in your adolescent dreams of 1968? We must live with the world we have and make the best of it.’”翻译为中文","completion":"似乎最现实的改变社会的方式是将斗争焦点放在赢得国家权力上，并将斗争服从于这个目标。首先我们获得权力，然后我们将创造一个配得上人类的社会。这是列宁尤其在《怎么办？》中的有力现实主义论点，但20世纪所有主要革命领袖都共享这一逻辑：罗莎·卢森堡、托洛茨基、葛兰西、毛泽东、切·格瓦拉。然而，他们斗争的经验表明，革命传统接受的现实主义深刻地不现实。那现实主义是权力的现实主义，不会做更多事情，只能重现权力。权力的现实主义是聚焦并指向一个目标的。反权力的现实主义，或者更好地说，反权力的反现实主义，如果我们要改变世界，必须截然不同。我们必须改变世界。 超越权力？ I 世界不能通过国家来改变。理论反思和整整一个世纪的糟糕经验都告诉我们这一点。满意的人说，“我们早就告诉你了，我们一直这么说。我们说这是荒谬的。我们告诉你，你不能违背人性。放弃梦想吧，放弃！” 全世界数以百万计的人放弃了梦想，放弃了一个根本不同类型社会的梦想。毫无疑问，苏联的解体和世界各地的民族解放运动的失败给数百万人带来了幻灭。革命的概念与获得国家控制权如此紧密地联系在一起，以至于通过获得国家控制权来改变世界的尝试失败，使许多人得出革命是不可能的结论。 期望降低了。对许多人来说，希望已经从他们的生活中消失，让位于对现实的苦涩、愤世嫉俗的和解。我们不可能创造我们所希望的自由和公正的社会，但我们总是可以投票给中间或中左翼政党，明知这不会有任何区别，但至少这样我们会有某种发泄我们挫败感的出口。“我们现在知道我们将无法改变世界”，马塞拉·塞拉诺的一部小说中的一个角色说。“这对我们这一代来说是最大的打击。我们在半路上失去了目标，当我们还有年龄和精力去做出改变……剩下的唯一事情就是谦卑地询问：尊严在哪里？” 书中的角色不是对的吗？如果我们不能通过国家来改变世界，那怎么办？国家只是权力关系网络中的一个节点。但无论我们从哪里开始，我们不是总会被权力的网络缠住吗？真正的断裂真的可以想象吗？我们不是被困在权力的无尽循环中吗？整个世界不就是一个可以在这里或那里稍微改善的蜘蛛网吗？或者，整个世界不就是蜘蛛网的多样性，以至于当我们刚突破一个时，我们就发现自己被缠住在另一个里面？将根本的异质性的想法留给那些用宗教安慰自己的人，对那些将天堂作为对生活在这泪河中的奖赏梦想的人，不是更好吗？ 试图退缩到私人尊严的生活中，说“让我们尽可能利用我们所拥有的”遇到的大问题是，世界不会停滞不动。资本主义的存在意味着发展的动态，这个动态不断地攻击我们，使我们的生活更直接受到金钱的支配，创造出越来越多的贫困、不平等、暴力。尊严不是私人问题，因为我们的生活与他人如此交织，私人尊严是不可能的。正是追求个人尊严，远非使我们走向相反方向，反而使我们完全面对革命的紧迫性。 保持革命想法的唯一方式是提高赌注。传统革命概念的问题也许不在于它目标过高，而在于它目标过低。捕获权力位置的概念，无论是政府权力还是社会中更分散的权力位置，都错过了革命的目标是解散权力关系，创造一个基于人们尊严相互认可的社会的点。失败的是革命意味着夺取权力以废除权力的概念。现在议程上的是直接克服权力关系这一更具挑战性的概念。革命现在唯一可以想象的方式不是征服权力，而是解散权力。苏联的解体不仅仅意味着数百万人的幻灭；它也带来了革命思想的解放，从革命等同于征服权力的认同中解放出来。 因此，这就是21世纪初革命的挑战：在不夺取权力的情况下改变世界。这个挑战最清晰地由墨西哥东南部的萨帕塔起义提出。萨帕塔人说，他们想要重新创造世界，创造一个有尊严、有人性的世界，但不夺取权力。 萨帕塔人呼吁在不夺取权力的情况下重新创造世界，得到了显著的共鸣。这种共鸣与近年来所谓的反权力领域的增长有关。这相当于减弱了将不满焦点对准国家的过程。这种弱化在希望革命的政党中很明显，它们不再有过去将不满引向夺取国家权力斗争的能力。社会民主党也是如此：无论人们是否为他们投票，他们不再像以前那样作为政治激进主义的焦点那么重要。如今的社会不满更多地是通过参与“非政府组织”、围绕特定问题开展活动、教师、医生或其他寻求以不将人物化的方式做事的工人的个人或集体关注，通过开发各种自治社区项目，甚至通过像在恰帕斯发生的长期和大规模叛乱这样的活动来表达。有一个广泛的活动领域，旨在以不将国家作为焦点的方式改变世界，并且不旨在获得权力位置。这个活动领域显然充满矛盾，当然包括许多可能被革命团体描述为“小资产阶级”或“浪漫”的活动。它很少以革命作为明确目标而具有革命性，然而活动中经常包含投射根本异质性的重要组成部分。它包括有时被称为“自主”的领域，但它远远超出通常所指的那个术语范围。有时候它与资本主义明显敌对，但它没有找到也没有寻求以前由革命和改艺党派提供的那种清晰焦点。这是萨帕塔呼声共鸣的混乱领域，反权力在其中增长。它是一个旧的改革、革命和无政府主义之间的区别看起来不再相关的领域，简单因为谁控制国家不是关注焦点。失去了革命焦点，不是因为人们不再渴望一种不同类型的社会，而是因为旧的焦点被证明是幻觉。萨帕塔人提出的挑战是从国家幻觉和权力幻觉的崩溃中拯救革命的挑战。 但我们如何在不夺取权力的情况下改变世界？仅仅提出这个问题就会招来讥讽的哼声、挑高的眉毛、居高临下的耸肩。 “你怎么这么天真？”有些人说，“你不知道社会不可能发生根本性变化吗？过去三十年你学到了什么？你不知道谈论革命是愚蠢的，还是你仍然陷在1968年的青少年梦想中？我们必须接受我们拥有的世界并尽力而为。”"},{"prompt":"请将“‘How can you be so naïve?’ say others, ‘Of course the world needs a revolution, but do you seriously think that change can be brought about without taking power, by election or otherwise? Do you not see the forces we are up against, the armies, the police, the paramilitary thugs? Do you not know that the only language they understand is power? Do you think capitalism will collapse if we all hold hands and sing “All we need is love”? Get real.’ Reality and power are so mutually encrusted that even to raise the question of dissolving power is to step off the edge of reality. All our categories of thought, all our assumptions about what is reality, or what is politics or economics or even where we live, are so permeated by power that just to say ‘no!’ to power precipitates us into a vertiginous world in which there are no fixed reference points to hold on to other than the force of our own ‘no!’. Power and social theory exist in such symbiosis that power is the lens through which theory sees the world, the headphone through which it hears the world: to ask for a theory of anti-power is to try to see the invisible, to hear the inaudible. To try to theorise anti-power is to wander in a largely unexplored world. How can the world be changed without taking power? The answer is obvious: we do not know. That is why it is so important to work at the answer, practically and theoretically. Hic Rhodus, hic saltus, but the saltus becomes more and more perilous, the pressures not to jump become ever greater, the danger of falling into a sea of absurdity ever more difficult to avoid. Let us forget our ‘fear of ridicule’6 and ask then: how can we even begin to think of changing the world without taking power? II To think of changing the world without taking power, we need to see that the concept of power is intensely contradictory. But to make this argument we need to go back to the beginning. In the beginning, we said, is the scream. It is a two-dimensional scream: a scream not just of rage, but of hope. And the hope is not a hope for salvation in the form of divine intervention. It is an active hope, a hope that we can change things, a scream of active refusal, a scream that points to doing. The scream that does not point to doing, the scream that turns in upon itself, that remains an eternal scream of despair or, much more common, an endless cynical grumble, is a scream which betrays itself: it loses its negative force and goes into an endless loop of self-affirmation as scream. Cynicism – I hate the world, but there is nothing that can be done – is the scream gone sour, the scream that suppresses its own self-negation. The scream implies doing. ‘In the beginning was the deed’, says Goethe’s Faust.7 But before the deed comes the doing. In the beginning was the doing. But in an oppressive society, doing is not an innocent, positive doing: it is impregnated with negativity, both because it is negated, frustrated doing, and because it negates the negation of itself. Before the doing comes the scream. It is not materialism that comes first, but negativity.8 Doing is practical negation. Doing changes, negates an existing state of affairs. Doing goes beyond, transcends. The scream, which is our starting point in a world which negates us – the only world we know – pushes us towards doing. Our materialism, if that word is relevant at all, is a materialism rooted in doing, doing-to-negate, negative practice, projection beyond. Our foundation, if that word is relevant at all, is not an abstract preference for matter over mind, but the scream, the negation of what exists. Doing, in other words, is central to our concern not simply because doing is a material precondition for living9 but because our central concern is changing the world, negating that which exists. To think the world from the perspective of the scream is to think it from the perspective of doing. Saint John is doubly wrong, then, when he says that ‘in the beginning was the Word’. Doubly wrong because, to put it in traditional terms, his statement is both positive and idealist. The word does not negate, as the scream does. And the word does not imply doing, as the scream does. The world of the word is a stable world, a sitting-back-in-an-armchair-and-having-a-chat world, a sitting-at-a-desk-and-writing world, a contented world, far from the scream which would change everything, far from the doing which negates.10 In the world of the word, doing is separated from talking and doing, practice is separated from theory. Theory in the world of the word is the thought of the Thinker, of someone in restful reflection, chin in hand, elbow on knee. ‘The philosophers’, as Marx says in his famous eleventh thesis on Feuerbach, ‘have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.’ Marx’s thesis does not mean that we should abandon theory for practice. It means rather that we should understand theory as part of practice, as part of the struggle to change the world. Both theory and doing are part of the practical movement of negation. This implies, then, that doing must be understood in a broad sense, certainly not just as work, and also not just as physical action, but as the whole movement of practical negativity. To emphasise the centrality of doing is not to deny the importance of thought or language but simply to see them as part of the total movement of practical negativity, of the practical projection beyond the world that exists towards a radically different world. To focus on doing is quite simply to see the world as struggle. It might be argued, with some force, that changing society should be thought of not in terms of doing but in terms of not-doing, laziness, refusal to work, enjoyment. ‘Let us be lazy in everything, except in loving and drinking, except in being lazy’: Lafargue begins his classic The Right to be Lazy with this quotation (1999, p. 3), implying that there is nothing more incompatible with capitalist exploitation than the laziness advocated by Lessing. Laziness in capitalist society, however, implies refusal to do, an active assertion of an alternative practice. Doing, in the sense in which we understand it here, includes laziness and the pursuit of pleasure, both of which are very much negative practices in a society based on their negation. Refusal to do, in a world based on the conversion of doing into work, can be seen as an effective form of resistance. Human doing implies projection-beyond, and hence the unity of theory and practice. Projection-beyond is seen by Marx as a distinctive characteristic of human doing: A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architecture from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. [Marx 1965, p. 178] The imagination of the labourer is ecstatic: at the commencement of the labour process it projects beyond what is to an otherness that might be. This otherness exists not only when it is created: it exists already, really, subjunctively, in the projection of the worker, in that which makes her human. The doing of the architect is negative, not only in its result, but in its whole process: it begins and ends with the negation of what exists. Even if she is the worst of architects, the doing is a creative doing. Bees, to the best of our knowledge, do not scream. They do not say ‘No! Enough of queens, enough of drones, we shall create a society which will be shaped by us workers, we shall emancipate ourselves!’ Their doing is not a doing that negates: it simply reproduces. We, however, do scream. Our scream is a projection-beyond, the articulation of an otherness that might be. If our scream is to be more than a smug look-how-rebellious-I-am scream (which is no scream at all), then it must involve a projected doing, the project of doing something to change that which we scream against.11 The scream and the doing-which-is-a-going-beyond distinguish humans from animals. Humans, but not animals, are ecstatic: they exist not only in, but also against-and-beyond themselves. Why? Not because going-beyond is part of our human nature, but simply because we scream. Negation comes not from our human essence, but from the situation in which we find ourselves. We scream and push-beyond not because that is human nature, but, on the contrary, because we are torn from what we consider to be humanity. Our negativity arises not from our humanity, but from the negation of our humanity, from the feeling that humanity is not-yet, that it is something to be fought for. It is not human nature, but the scream of our starting point that compels us to focus on doing.12 To take doing, rather than being or talking or thinking, as the focus of our thought, has many implications. Doing implies movement. To start from doing-as-going-beyond (and not just the busy-bee doing-as-reproduction) means that everything (or at least everything human) is in movement, everything is becoming, that there is no ‘being’, or rather that being can only be a frustrated becoming. The perspective of the scream-doing is inevitably historical, because the human experience can only be understood as a constant moving-beyond (or possibly a frustrated moving-beyond). This is important, because if the starting point is not screaming-doing (doing-as-negation) but rather the word or discourse or a positive understanding of doing (as reproduction), then there is no possibility of understanding society historically: the movement of history becomes broken down into a series of snapshots, a diachronic series, a chronology. Becoming is broken down into a series of states of being.13”翻译为中文","completion":"“‘你怎么能这么天真？’别人说，‘当然，世界需要一场革命，但你真的认为改变可以在不夺取权力的情况下实现吗，无论是通过选举还是其他方式？你没有看到我们所面对的势力吗，军队、警察、准军事暴徒？你不知道他们唯一懂的语言就是权力吗？如果我们都手拉手唱《我们需要的只是爱》，你认为资本主义会崩溃吗？现实一点吧。’ 现实和权力如此相互嵌入，以至于提出解散权力的问题就像是走出了现实的边缘。我们所有的思维范畴，我们关于什么是现实、政治或经济，甚至我们居住的地方的所有假设，都是如此充斥着权力，以至于仅仅说‘不！’给权力就会让我们陷入一个没有固定参照点可依靠的眩晕世界，除了我们自己的‘不！’的力量。权力和社会理论如此共生，以至于权力是理论观察世界、听见世界的镜头和耳机：寻求一种反权力的理论就像是试图看见不可见、听见不可闻。试图理论化反权力就像是在一个大部分未被探索的世界中漫游。 我们怎样在不夺取权力的情况下改变世界？答案显而易见：我们不知道。这就是为什么实践和理论地努力寻找答案如此重要。‘这里是罗德岛，是时候跳跃了’，但跳跃变得越来越危险，不跳的压力变得越来越大，避免掉入荒谬的海洋的难度越来越大。 让我们忘记我们的‘害怕被嘲笑’，然后问：我们如何开始考虑在不夺取权力的情况下改变世界？ II 要考虑在不夺取权力的情况下改变世界，我们需要明白权力概念是极其矛盾的。但要进行这个论证，我们需要回到起点。 起点，我们说，是尖叫。这是一个两维的尖叫：不仅仅是愤怒的尖叫，也是希望的尖叫。这个希望不是对以神的干预形式的救赎的希望。这是一个积极的希望，一个我们能改变事物的希望，一个积极拒绝的尖叫，一个指向行动的尖叫。不指向行动的尖叫，一个转向自身的尖叫，永远是绝望的尖叫，或者更常见的，无尽的愤世嫉俗的嘀咕，是一个背叛自身的尖叫：它失去了它的否定力量，进入一个无尽的自我肯定的尖叫循环。愤世嫉俗—— 我讨厌这个世界，但没有办法改变——是酸化了的尖叫，抑制了自己的自我否定。 尖叫暗示了行动。歌德的浮士德说，“起初是行动”。但在行动之前是行动中。起初是行动中。但在压迫性社会中，行动不是一个纯洁的、积极的行动：因为它是被否定的、挫败的行动，它充满了否定性，因为它否定了对它自身的否定。在行动中之前是尖叫。首先不是唯物主义，而是否定性。 行动是实践上的否定。行动改变了，否定了现有的事物状态。行动超越了，穿越了。这个尖叫，作为我们在一个否定我们的世界——我们所知的唯一世界——的出发点，推动我们去行动。如果这个词还有相关性的话，我们的唯物主义是根植于行动、行动以否定、否定性的实践、超越性的投射的唯物主义。如果这个词还有相关性的话，我们的基础不是一种对物质超过心灵的抽象偏好，而是尖叫，对现存事物的否定。 换句话说，行动对我们的关注是核心，不仅仅是因为行动是生存的物质前提，而是因为我们的核心关注是改变世界，否定现存的东西。从尖叫的视角思考世界是从行动的视角思考它。 圣约翰犯了双重错误，当他说“起初是道”时。双重错误，因为用传统的术语说，他的陈述既是积极的也是唯心的。道不像尖叫那样否定。而且道并不像尖叫那样暗示行动。道的世界是一个稳定的世界，一个坐在扶手椅里闲聊的世界，一个坐在书桌前写作的世界，一个满意的世界，远离会改变一切的尖叫，远离否定的行动。在道的世界里，行动与谈话和行动分离，实践与理论分离。道的世界里的理论是思考者的思想，是某个人沉思时安静反思的，下巴抵在手上，手肘放在膝盖上。“哲学家们”，正如马克思在他著名的关于费尔巴哈的第十一论题中所说，“只是以各种方式解释世界；然而，问题在于改变它。” 马克思的论题并不意味着我们应该放弃理论去从事实践。它更意味着我们应该将理论理解为实践的一部分，作为改变世界斗争的一部分。理论和行动都是否定性实践活动的一部分。这意味着，行动必须被广义地理解，当然不仅仅是作为工作，也不仅仅是作为身体行为，而是作为全面否定性实践活动的一部分。强调行动的中心性不是否认思想或语言的重要性，而是简单地将它们视为全面否定性实践活动的一部分，将它们视为朝着一个与现存世界截然不同的世界的实践性投射的一部分。关注行动很简单，就是将世界看作斗争。 有人可能会有力地争辩，改变社会不应该被视为行动，而应该被视为不行动、懒惰、拒绝工作、享乐。拉法格以这句话开头他的经典著作《懒惰权利》（1999年，第3页），意味着没有什么比莱辛格提倡的懒惰更不相容于资本主义的剥削了。然而，在资本主义社会中，懒惰意味着拒绝行动，主动主张一种替代性实践。在我们这里理解的行动中，懒惰和追求快乐都包含在内，这两者在一个建立在否定它们的基础上的社会中都是非常负面的实践。在一个基于将行动转化为工作的世界中，拒绝行动可以被视为一种有效的抵抗形式。 人类的行动暗示着超越性投射，因此包含了理论与实践的统一。马克思将超越性投射视为人类行动的独特特征： 一只蜘蛛进行的操作类似于一个织布工的操作，而一只蜜蜂在建造她的蜂房时让许多建筑师相形见绌。但最糟糕的建筑与最好的蜜蜂之间的区别在于，建筑师在现实中建造他的结构之前，在想象中先建造了它。在每一个劳动过程的结束，我们都得到了一个在劳动者开始时已经在他的想象中存在的结果。[马克思1965年，第178页] 劳动者的想象是狂喜的：在劳动过程开始时，它超越了现有的事物，投射到了一个可能存在的异质性上。这个异质性不仅在它被创造时存在：它已经存在，真实地、虚拟地，在工人的投射中，在使她成为人的那个东西中。建筑师的行动是负面的，不仅在其结果中，而且在整个过程中：它开始和结束于对现有事物的否定。即使她是最糟糕的建筑师，行动也是一种创造性的行动。 据我们所知，蜜蜂不会尖叫。它们不会说‘不！够了，够了有女王的，够了有雄蜂的，我们将创造一个由我们工蜂塑造的社会，我们将解放我们自己！’它们的行动不是一种否定性的行动：它仅仅是再生产。然而，我们确实尖叫。我们的尖叫是一种超越性投射，是一个可能存在的异质性的表达。如果我们的尖叫不仅仅是一种自鸣得意的“看我多么反叛”的尖叫（这根本不是尖叫），那么它必须涉及一个投射性行动，一个为了改变我们所尖叫反对的事物的项目。尖叫和行动-即超越性行动区分人类与动物。人类，但不是动物，是狂喜的：他们的存在不仅在于自身，而且在于超越自身。 为什么？不是因为超越是我们人类天性的一部分，而仅仅是因为我们尖叫。否定不来源于我们的人类本质，而是来源于我们所处的情境。我们尖叫并超越不是因为那是人类天性，而恰恰相反，是因为我们被撕裂离开了我们认为的人性。我们的否定性不是来源于我们的人性，而是来源于我们人性的否定，来源于我们感到人性尚未到来，人性是需要争取的事物的感觉。不是人类天性，而是我们出发点的尖叫促使我们关注行动。 以行动而不是存在、谈话或思考作为我们思考的焦点，有许多含义。行动暗示了运动。从行动-即超越性行动（而不仅仅是忙碌的蜜蜂行动-即再生产）作为起点意味着一切（或至少一切人类的事物）都在运动中，一切都在成为，不存在“存在”，或者更确切地说，存在只能是受挫的成为。尖叫-行动的视角不可避免地是历史性的，因为人类经验只能被理解为不断的超越性运动（或可能是受挫的超越性运动）。这很重要，因为如果出发点不是尖叫-行动（行动作为否定）而是道、话语或对行动的积极理解（作为再生产），那么就不可能历史性地理解社会：历史的运动被分解成一系列的快照，一个历时性系列，一个年表。成为被分解成一系列的存在状态。”"},{"prompt":"请将“To put the point in other words, humans are subjects while animals are not. Subjectivity refers to the conscious projection beyond that which exists, the ability to negate that which exists and to create something that does not yet exist. Subjectivity, the movement of the scream-doing, involves a movement against limits, against containment, against closure. The doer is not. Not only that, but doing is the movement against is-ness, against that-which-is. Any definition of the subject is therefore contradictory or indeed violent: the attempt to pin down that which is a movement against being pinned down. The idea that we can start from the assertion that people are subjects has been much criticised in recent years, especially by theorists associated with postmodernism. The idea of the person as subject, we are told, is a historical construct. That may be so, but our starting point, the scream of complete refusal to accept the misery of capitalist society, takes us inevitably to the notion of subjectivity. To deny human subjectivity is to deny the scream or, which comes to the same thing, to turn the scream into a scream of despair. ‘Ha! Ha!’ they mock, ‘you scream as though it were possible to change society radically. But there is no possibility of radical change, there is no way out.’ Our starting point makes such an approach impossible. The sharpness of our No! is a sword that cuts through many a theoretical knot. Doing is inherently social. What I do is always part of a social flow of doing, in which the precondition of my doing is the doing (or having-done) of others, in which the doing of others provides the means of my doing. Doing is inherently plural, collective, choral, communal. This does not mean that all doing is (or indeed should be) undertaken collectively. It means rather that it is difficult to conceive of a doing that does not have the doing of others as a precondition. I sit at the computer and write this, apparently a lonely individual act, but my writing is part of a social process, a plaiting of my writing with the writing of others (those mentioned in the footnotes and a million others), and also with the doing of those who designed the computer, assembled it, packed it, transported it, those who installed the electricity in the house, those who generated the electricity, those who produced the food that gives me the energy to write, and so on, and so on. There is a community of doing, a collective of doers, a flow of doing through time and space. Past doing (of ourselves and others) becomes the means of doing in the present. Any act, however individual it seems, is part of a chorus of doing in which all humanity is the choir (albeit an anarchic and discordant choir). Our doings are so intertwined that it is impossible to say where one ends and another begins. Clearly there are many doings that do not in turn create the conditions for the doing of others, that do not feed back into the social flow of doing as a whole: it is quite possible, for example, that no one will ever read what I am now doing. However, the doings that do not lead back into the social flow of doing do not for that reason cease to be social. My activity is social whether or not anybody reads this: it is important not to confuse sociality and functionality. To speak of the social flow of doing is not to deny the materiality of the done. When I make a chair, the chair exists materially. When I write a book, the book exists as an object. It has an existence independent of mine, and may still exist when I no longer exist. In that sense it might be said that there is an objectification of my subjective doing, that the done acquires an existence separate from the doing, that the done abstracts itself from the flow of doing. This is true, however, only if my doing is seen as an individual act. Seen from the social flow of doing, the objectification of my subjective doing is at most a fleeting objectification. The existence of the chair as chair depends upon someone sitting upon it, reincorporating it into the flow of doing. The existence of the book as book depends upon your reading it, the braiding of your doing (reading) with my doing (writing) to reintegrate the done (the book) into the social flow of doing.14 It is when we understand ‘we scream’ as a material ‘we scream’, as a screaming-doing, that ‘we-ness’ (that question that rumbles through our book) gains force. Doing, in other words, is the material constitution of the ‘we’, the conscious and unconscious, planned and unplanned, braiding of our lives through time. This braiding of our lives, this collective doing, involves, if the collective flow of doing is recognised, a mutual recognition of one another as doers, as active subjects. Our individual doing receives its social validation from its recognition as part of the social flow. III To begin to think about power and changing the world without taking power (or indeed anything else), we need to start from doing. Doing implies being able-to-do. The scream is of no significance without doing, and doing is inconceivable unless we are able-to-do. If we are deprived of our capacity-to-do, or rather, if we are deprived of our capacity to project-beyond-and-do, of our capacity to do negatively, ecstatically, then we are deprived of our humanity, our doing is reduced (and we are reduced) to the level of a bee. If we are deprived of our capacity-to-do, then our scream becomes a scream of despair. Power, in the first place, is simply that: can-ness,15 capacity-to-do, the ability to do things. Doing implies power, power-to-do. In this sense we commonly use ‘power’ to refer to something good: I feel powerful, I feel good. The little train in the children’s story (Piper 1978) that says ‘I think I can, I think I can’ as it tries to reach the top of the mountain, has a growing sense of its own power. We go to a good political meeting and come away with an enhanced sense of our own power. We read a good book and feel empowered. The women’s movement has given women a greater sense of their own power. Power in this sense can be referred to as ‘power-to’, power-to-do. Power-to, it must be emphasised again, is always a social power, even though it may not appear to be so. The story of the little train presents power-to as a matter of individual determination, but in fact that is never the case. Our doing is always part of a social flow of doing, even where it appears to be an individual act. Our capacity to do is always an interlacing of our activity with the previous or present activity of others. Our capacity to do is always the result of the doing of others. Power-to, therefore, is never individual: it is always social. It cannot be thought of as existing in some pure, unsullied state, for its existence will always be part of the way in which sociality is constituted, the way in which doing is organised. Doing (and power-to-do) is always part of a social flow, but that flow is constituted in different ways. It is when the social flow of doing is fractured that power-to is transformed into its opposite, power-over. The social flow is fractured when doing itself is broken.16 Doing-as-projection-beyond is broken when some people arrogate to themselves the projection-beyond (conception) of the doing and command others to execute what they have conceived.17 Doing is broken as the ‘powerful’ conceive but do not execute, while the others execute but do not conceive. Doing is broken as the ‘powerful’ separate the done from the doers and appropriate it to themselves. The social flow is broken as the ‘powerful’ present themselves as the individual doers, while the rest simply disappear from sight. If we think of ‘powerful’ men in history, for example, of Julius Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, then power appears as the attribute of an individual. But of course their power to do things was not an ability to do them on their own, but an ability to command others to do what they wished them to do. The ‘we’ of doing appears as an ‘I’, or as a ‘he’ (more often a ‘he’ than a ‘she’): Caesar did this, Caesar did that. The ‘we’ is now an antagonistic ‘we’, divided between the rulers (the visible subjects) and the ruled (the invisible de-subject-ified subjects). Power-to now becomes ‘power-over’, a relation of power over others. These others are powerless (or apparently powerless), deprived of the capacity to realise our own projects, if only because we spend our days realising the projects of those who exercise power-over. For most of us, then, power is turned into its opposite. Power means not our capacity-to-do, but our incapacity-to-do. It means not the assertion of our subjectivity but the destruction of our subjectivity. The existence of power relations means not the capacity to obtain some future good but just the contrary: the incapacity to obtain the future good,18 the incapacity to realise our own projects, our own dreams. It is not that we cease to project, that we cease to dream, but unless the projects and dreams are cut to match the ‘reality’ of power relations (and this is usually achieved, if at all, through bitter experience), then they are met with frustration. Power, for those without the means of commanding others, is frustration. The existence of power-to as power-over means that the vast majority of doers are converted into the done-to, their activity transformed into passivity, their subjectivity into objectivity.19 Whereas power-to is a uniting, a bringing together of my doing with the doing of others, the exercise of power-over is a separation. The exercise of power-over separates conception from realisation, done from doing, one person’s doing from another’s, subject from object. Those who exercise power-over are Separators,20 separating done from doing, doers from the means of doing. Power-over is the breaking of the social flow of doing. Those who exert power over the doing of others deny the subjectivity of those others, deny their part in the flow of doing, exclude them from history. Power-over breaks mutual recognition: those over whom power is exercised are not recognised (and those who exercise power are not recognised by anyone whom they recognise as worthy of giving recognition21). The doing of the doers is deprived of social validation: we and our doing become invisible. History becomes the history of the powerful, of those who tell others what to do. The flow of doing becomes an antagonistic process in which the doing of most is denied, in which the doing of most is appropriated by the few. The flow of doing becomes a broken process. The breaking of doing always involves physical force or the threat of physical force. There is always the threat: ‘Work for us or you will die or suffer physical punishment.’ If domination is robbery of the done from the doer, that robbery is, necessarily, armed robbery. But what makes the use or threat of physical force possible is its stabilisation or institutionalisation in various ways, an understanding of which is crucial to understanding the dynamic and weakness of power-over. ”翻译为中文","completion":"换句话说，人类是主体，而动物不是。主体性指的是超越现存事物的有意识投射，即否定现存事物并创造尚不存在之物的能力。主体性，这种尖叫-行动的运动，涉及一种对抗限制、对抗约束、对抗封闭的运动。行动者不存在。不仅如此，行动是对抗现状、对抗现存事物的运动。因此，任何对主体的定义都是矛盾的，甚至是暴力的：试图界定那些对抗被界定的运动。近年来，特别是与后现代主义相关的理论家们，对从人们是主体这一断言开始的观点进行了大量批评。我们被告知，作为主体的人这一概念是历史构建的。可能是这样，但我们的出发点，即对资本主义社会的苦难完全拒绝的尖叫，不可避免地带我们走向主体性的概念。否认人类主体性就是否认尖叫，或者说，归根结底，把尖叫变成了绝望的尖叫。‘哈！哈！’他们嘲笑说，‘你尖叫好像真的有可能彻底改变社会似的。但没有彻底改变的可能性，没有出路。’我们的出发点使得这种方法成为不可能。我们的“不！”的锋利是一把切断许多理论困境的剑。 行动本质上是社会性的。我所做的总是社会行动流动的一部分，其中我的行动的前提是他人的行动（或已经做过的行动），他人的行动为我的行动提供了手段。行动本质上是复数的、集体的、合唱的、共同的。这并不意味着所有行动都是（或确实应该是）集体进行的。这更意味着很难想象一个不以他人行动为前提的行动。我坐在电脑前写作，看似是孤独的个体行为，但我的写作是一个社会过程的一部分，是我的写作与其他人的写作（如脚注中提到的那些和数百万其他人）的编织，也是那些设计电脑、组装它、包装它、运输它的人的行动，是那些在房子中安装电力的人、产生电力的人、生产给我提供写作能量的食物的人等等的行动的编织。存在着行动的共同体、行动者的集体、穿越时间和空间的行动流。过去的行动（我们自己和他人的）成为现在行动的手段。任何行为，无论看起来多么个体化，都是人类合唱团中所有人都是合唱团成员（尽管是一个无政府且不和谐的合唱团）的行动合唱中的一部分。我们的行动如此交织在一起，以至于无法说出一个行动在哪里结束，另一个在哪里开始。显然，有许多行动不会反过来为他人的行动创造条件，不会回馈到整个社会行动流中：比如，很可能没有人会阅读我现在所做的。然而，不会回到社会行动流中的行动并不因此而失去社会性。我的活动无论有没有人阅读这个都是社会性的：重要的是不要混淆社会性和功能性。 讲述社会行动流并不是否认已完成事物的物质性。当我制作一把椅子时，椅子以物质形式存在。当我写一本书时，书作为一个对象存在。它有着独立于我存在的存在，并且可能在我不再存在时仍然存在。从这个意义上说，可以说我的主观行动客观化了，已完成的事物获得了与行动分离的存在，已完成的事物从行动流中抽象出来。然而，这只有在将我的行动视为个体行为时才成立。从社会行动流的角度看，我的主观行动的客观化最多是一种短暂的客观化。椅子作为椅子的存在依赖于有人坐在上面，将其重新纳入行动流中。书作为书的存在取决于你的阅读，将你的行动（阅读）与我的行动（写作）编织在一起，将已完成的事物（书）重新整合到社会行动流中。 当我们理解“我们尖叫”为一种物质性的“我们尖叫”，作为一种尖叫-行动时，“我们性”（这个贯穿我们书中的问题）就有了力量。换句话说，行动是“我们”的物质构成，是我们生活通过时间的有意识和无意识、有计划和无计划的编织。“我们”的生活的这种编织，这种集体行动，如果承认集体行动流的话，涉及到对彼此作为行动者、作为主动主体的相互认可。我们作为社会行动流的一部分获得的个体行动获得了社会认可。 III 要开始思考权力和在不夺取权力的情况下改变世界（或实际上任何其他事情），我们需要从行动开始。 行动意味着有能力去做。如果没有行动，尖叫就没有意义，如果我们不能行动，行动就无法想象。如果我们被剥夺了我们的行动能力，或者说，如果我们被剥夺了我们的超越性投射并行动的能力，我们的否定性、狂喜性行动的能力，那么我们就被剥夺了我们的人性，我们的行动（以及我们自己）就被降低到了蜜蜂的水平。如果我们被剥夺了行动能力，那么我们的尖叫就变成了绝望的尖叫。 首先，权力就是这样：能力，行动能力，做事的能力。行动意味着权力，行动的权力。这个意义上，我们通常用“权力”来指某件好事：我感觉有力量，感觉良好。儿童故事中的小火车（Piper 1978）说“我认为我能做到，我认为我能做到”当它试图到达山顶时，有着自己力量不断增长的感觉。我们参加了一个好的政治会议，带着增强的自我力量感离开。我们读了一本好书，感觉被赋予了力量。妇女运动给予了女性更强的自我力量感。这个意义上的权力可以被称为“权力去做”，行动的权力。 必须再次强调，“权力去做”总是一种社会权力，即使它可能看起来不是这样。小火车的故事将“权力去做”呈现为个体决心的问题，但实际上从来都不是这样。我们的行动总是社会行动流的一部分，即使它看起来像是个体行为。我们的行动能力总是我们的活动与他人先前或现在的活动的交织的结果。我们的行动能力总是他人行动的结果。 因此，“权力去做”永远不是个体的：它总是社会的。不能认为它以某种纯净、未受污染的状态存在，因为它的存在总是社会性构成的一部分，是行动组织方式的一部分。行动（和行动权力）总是社会行动流的一部分，但这种流是以不同的方式构成的。 当社会行动流被断裂时，“权力去做”就转化为它的对立面，“权力凌驾于”。 社会行动流被断裂是当行动本身被打断时。当一些人将行动的超越性投射（构想）归于自己，并命令他人执行他们所构想的时，“行动作为超越性投射”就被打断了。行动被打断了，“有权力者”构想但不执行，而其他人执行而不构想。行动被打断了，“有权力者”将已完成的事物与行动者分离并据为己有。社会行动流被打断了，“有权力者”将自己呈现为个体行动者，而其他人则从视野中消失。“有权力者”通过命令他人做事的能力而看起来是个体的属性。但当然他们做事的能力并不是他们独自一人的能力，而是命令他人去按照他们的意愿行动的能力。“我们”的行动呈现为一个“我”，或一个“他”（通常是“他”而不是“她”）：“凯撒做了这个，凯撒做了那个。”“我们”现在是一个对立的“我们”，分为统治者（可见的主体）和被统治者（不可见的去主体化的主体）。\\"权力去做\\"现在成为“权力凌驾于他人”的关系。这些其他人是无力的（或表面上是无力的），被剥夺了实现我们自己项目的能力，仅仅因为我们花费我们的日子实现那些行使权力凌驾于他人的人的项目。 对我们大多数人来说，权力变成了它的反面。权力意味着我们做事的无能为力。它意味着我们主体性的否定而不是主体性的肯定。权力关系的存在意味着不是获得某个未来的好处的能力，而恰恰相反：无法获得未来的好处的无能为力，无法实现我们自己的项目、我们自己的梦想。这并不是说我们停止了投射，停止了梦想，但除非项目和梦想被削减以适应“权力关系”的“现实”（如果这是通过痛苦的经历实现的），否则它们会遭遇挫折。对于那些没有命令他人的手段的人来说，权力是挫折。\\"权力去做\\"作为\\"权力凌驾于他人\\"的存在意味着大多数行动者被转化为被行动于者，他们的活动被转化为被动，他们的主体性被转化为客体性。 而“权力去做”是一种团结，是将我的行动与他人的行动结合起来，“权力凌驾于他人”的行使是一种分离。\\"权力凌驾于他人\\"的行使将构想与实现、已完成的与行动、一个人的行动与另一个人的行动、主体与客体分离。行使“权力凌驾于他人”的人是分离者，将已完成的与行动、行动者与行动手段分离。 “权力凌驾于他人”是社会行动流的断裂。那些对他人的行动行使权力的人否认了那些其他人的主体性，否认了他们在行动流中的部分，将他们排除在历史之外。“权力凌驾于他人”打破了相互认可：那些被行使权力的人不被认可（那些行使权力的人也不被任何他们认为值得给予认可的人认可）。行动者的行动被剥夺了社会认可：我们和我们的行动变得看不见。历史成为有权力者的历史，那些告诉他人该做什么的人的历史。行动流成为一个对抗性过程，其中大多数人的行动被否定，在其中大多数人的行动被少数人占有。行动流成为一个断裂的过程。 行动的断裂总是涉及到物理力量或物理力量的威胁。总是有威胁：“为我们工作，否则你将死亡或遭受体罚。”如果统治是从行动者那里抢夺已完成的事物，那么这种抢夺必然是持械抢劫。但使使用或威胁使用物理力量成为可能的是它以各种方式的稳定化或制度化，理解这一点对理解“权力凌驾于他人”的动态和弱点至关重要。"},{"prompt":"请将“In pre-capitalist societies, power-over is stabilised on the basis of a personal relation between ruler and ruled. In a slave society, the exercise of power-over is institutionalised around the idea that some people (whose quality as persons is denied) are the property of others. In feudal societies, it is the notion of divinely-ordained hierarchies of person-hood that gives form to the commanding of some by others. The personal nature of the relation of power-over means that the use or threat of force is always directly present in the relation of domination itself. The refusal to work is always an act of personal rebellion against one’s owner or lord and punishable by that owner or lord. In capitalist society (which is what interests us most, since that is where we live and what we scream against), the stabilisation into a ‘right’ of the bossing of some people by others is based not on the direct relation between ruler and doer but on the relation between the ruler and the done. The doers have now won freedom from personal dependence on the rulers, but they are still held in a position of subordination by the fracturing of the collective flow of doing. Capital is based on the freezing of the past doing of people into property. Since past doing is the precondition of present doing, the freezing and appropriation of past doing separates the precondition of present doing from that past doing, constitutes it as an identifiable ‘means of doing’ (more familiarly, ‘means of production’). Thus, the freed serfs and slaves are freed into a world where the only way in which they can have access to the means of doing (and therefore of living) is to sell their capacity-to-do (their power-to-do, now transformed into power-to-labour or labour-power) to those who ‘own’ the means of doing. Their freedom in no sense frees them from subordination of their doing to the dictates of others. Capital is that: the assertion of command over others on the basis of ‘ownership’ of the done and hence of the means of doing, the pre-condition for the doing of those others who are commanded. All class societies involve the separation of done (or a part of the done) from doing and doers, but in capitalism that separation becomes the sole axis of domination. There is a peculiar rigidification of the done, a peculiarly radical separation of done from doing. If, from the perspective of the social flow of doing, the objectification of the done is a fleeting objectification, immediately overcome through the incorporation of the done into the flow of doing, then capitalism depends on making that objectification a durable objectification, on converting the done into an object, a thing apart, something that can be defined as property. Capitalism thus implies a new definition of ‘subject’ and ‘object’, in which the ‘object’ is durably and rigidly separated from the subject’s doing.22 This does not mean that subject and object are constituted by capitalism. Subjectivity is inherent in negativity (the scream), and negativity is inherent in any society (certainly any in which doing is subordinated to others). However, the separation between subject and object, doer and done or done-to, acquires a new meaning under capitalism, leading to a new definition and a new consciousness of subjectivity and objectivity, a new distance and antagonism between subject and object. Thus, rather than the subject being the product of modernity, it is rather that modernity expresses consciousness of the new separation of subject and object which is inherent in the focusing of social domination upon the done.23 Another way of formulating the same point is to say that there is a separation of the constitution of the object from its existence. The done now exists in durable autonomy from the doing which constituted it. Whereas from the perspective of the social flow of doing, the existence of an object is merely a fleeting moment in the flow of subjective constitution (or doing), capitalism depends on the conversion of that fleeting moment into a durable objectification. But of course durable autonomy is an illusion, a very real illusion. The separation of done from doing is a real illusion, a real process in which the done nevertheless never ceases to depend on the doing. Likewise, the separation of existence from constitution is a real illusion, a real process in which existence never ceases to depend on constitution. The definition of the done as private property is the negation of the sociality of doing, but this too is a real illusion, a real process in which private property never ceases to depend on the sociality of doing. The rupture of doing does not mean that doing ceases to be social, simply that it becomes indirectly social. Capital is based not on the ownership of people but on the ownership of the done and, on that basis, of the repeated buying of people’s power-to-do. Since people are not owned, they can quite easily refuse to work for others without suffering any immediate punishment. The punishment comes rather in being cut off from the means of doing (and of survival). The use of force comes then not as part of the direct relation between capitalist and worker. Force is focused in the first place not on the doer but on the done: its focus is the protection of property, the protection of ownership of the done. It is exercised not by the individual owner of the done, for that would be incompatible with the free nature of the relation between capitalist and worker, but by a separate instance responsible for protecting the property of the done, the state. The separation of the economic and the political (and the constitution of the ‘economic’ and the ‘political’ by this separation) is therefore central to the exercise of domination under capitalism. If domination is always a process of armed robbery, the peculiarity of capitalism is that the person with the arms stands apart from the person doing the robbery, merely supervising that the robbery conforms with the law. Without this separation, property (as opposed to mere temporary possession) of the done, and therefore capitalism itself, would be impossible. This is important for the discussion of power, because the separation of the economic and the political makes it appear that it is the political which is the realm of the exercise of power (leaving the economic as a ‘natural’ sphere beyond question), whereas in fact the exercise of power (the conversion of power-to into power-over) is already inherent in the separation of the done from the doing, and hence in the very constitution of the political and the economic as distinct forms of social relations (see Pashukanis 1978; Holloway and Picciotto 1977, 1978b). The conversion of power-to into power-over always involves the fracturing of the flow of doing, but in capitalism, to a far greater extent than in any previous society, the fracturing of the social flow of doing is the principle on which society is constructed. The fact that the property of the done is the axis on which the right to command the doing of others is based puts the breaking of the flow of doing at the centre of every aspect of social relations. The breaking of the social flow of doing is the breaking of everything.24 Most obviously, the rupture of doing breaks the collective ‘we’. The collectivity is divided into two classes of people: those who, by virtue of their ownership of the means of doing, command others to do, and those who, by virtue of the fact that they are deprived of access to the means of doing, do what the others tell them to do. That projection which distinguishes people from bees is now monopolised by the former class, the owners of the means of doing. For those who are told what to do, the unity of projection-and-doing which distinguishes the worst architect from the best bee is broken. Their humanity, in other words, is broken, denied. Subjectivity (projection-and-doing) is appropriated by the capitalists (or rather, not so much by the capitalists as by the perverse relation of capital). The doers, deprived of the unity of projection-and-doing, lose their subjectivity, become reduced to the level of bees. They become objectivised subjects. They lose too their collectivity, their ‘we-ness’: we are fragmented into a multitude of ‘I’s, or, even worse, into a multitude of ‘I’s, ‘you’s, ‘he’s, ‘she’s and ‘they’s. Once the social flow of doing is broken, the we-ness which it braids is broken too. The break between projection and doing is also a break between the doers and the doing. The doing is ordained by the non-doers (the commanders of doing), so that the doing becomes an alien act (an externally imposed act) for those who do. Their doing is transformed from an active doing to a passive, suffered, alien doing. Doing becomes labour.25 Doing which is not directly commanded by others is separated from labour and seen as less important: ‘What do you do?’ ‘Oh, I don’t do anything, I’m just a housewife.’ The separation between doer and doing, doing and done, is a growing separation. The capitalists’ control of the done (and hence of the means of doing) grows and grows, accumulates and accumulates. The fact that capitalist rule is focused on the done rather than on the doers means that it is boundlessly voracious in a way in which doer-centred domination (slavery, feudalism) is not: ‘Accumulate! Accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets!’ (Marx 1965, p. 595). The endless drive to increase the quantitative accumulation of the done (dead labour, capital) imposes an ever faster rhythm of doing and an ever more desperate appropriation of the product of doing by the owner of the done. The done comes to dominate the doing and the doer more and more. The crystallisation of that-which-has-been-done into a ‘thing’ shatters the flow of doing into a million fragments. Thing-ness denies the primacy of doing (and hence of humanity). When we use a computer, we think of it as a thing, not of the union of our writing with the flow of doing which created the computer. Thing-ness is crystallised amnesia.26 The doing that created the thing (not just that specific doing, but the whole flow of doing of which it is a part) is forgotten. The thing now stands there on its own as a commodity to be sold, with its own value. The value of the commodity is the declaration of the commodity’s autonomy from doing. The doing which created the commodity is forgotten, the collective flow of doing of which it is part is forced underground, turned into a subterranean stream. Value acquires a life of its own. The breaking of the flow of doing is carried to its ultimate consequences. Doing is pushed below the surface, and with it the doers, but it is more than that: those who exercise power-over are also pushed aside by the fragmentation on which their power-over is based. The subject in capitalist society is not the capitalist. It is not the capitalists who take the decisions, who shape what is done. It is value. It is capital, accumulated value. That which the capitalists ‘own’ – capital – has pushed the capitalists aside. They are capitalists only to the extent that they are loyal servants of capital. The very significance of ownership falls into the background. Capital acquires a dynamic of its own and the leading members of society are quite simply its most loyal servants, its most servile courtiers. This is true not only of capitalists themselves, but also of politicians, civil servants, professors, and so on. The rupture of the flow of doing is carried to its most absurd consequences. Power-over is separated from the powerful. Doing is denied and the crystallised negation of doing – value – rules the world. Instead of doing being the braiding of our lives, it is now the negation of doing – value – in the form of its visible and universal equivalent – money – which braids our lives, or rather tears our lives apart and sticks the fragments back together into a cracked whole.”翻译为中文","completion":"在前资本主义社会中，权力凌驾于他人是基于统治者与被统治者之间的个人关系而稳定下来的。在奴隶社会中，对他人行使权力凌驾于他人的做法是围绕着某些人（其作为人的品质被否定）是其他人财产的观念而制度化的。在封建社会中，是神圣授予的人格层次观念为他人指挥他人提供了形式。权力凌驾于他人关系的个人性质意味着使用或威胁使用武力总是直接存在于统治关系本身之中。拒绝工作总是一种针对自己的主人或领主的个人叛逆行为，并受到该主人或领主的惩罚。 在资本主义社会（这是我们最感兴趣的，因为那是我们生活的地方，也是我们所反抗的），一些人指挥他人的“权利”的稳定不是基于统治者与行动者之间的直接关系，而是基于统治者与已完成事务之间的关系。行动者现在赢得了从统治者的个人依赖中解放出来的自由，但他们仍然因为集体行动流的断裂而被置于从属地位。资本主义基于将人们的过去行动冻结为财产。由于过去的行动是当前行动的前提，对过去行动的冻结和占有将当前行动的前提与过去行动分开，将其构成为可识别的“行动手段”（更熟悉的说法是“生产手段”）。因此，获得解放的农奴和奴隶走向了一个世界，他们只有将自己的行动能力（他们的行动权力，现在转化为劳动力或劳动力）出售给那些“拥有”行动手段的人，才能获得行动手段（因此生存）的途径。他们的自由绝不意味着他们从对他人指示的行动的从属中解放出来。 资本就是这样：基于对已完成事务的“所有权”以及由此对行动手段的所有权，对其他人行使指挥权。所有的阶级社会都涉及到将已完成的事物（或已完成事物的一部分）与行动及行动者分开，但在资本主义中，这种分离成为了统治的唯一轴心。存在一种对已完成事务的特殊僵化，已完成事务与行动之间存在一种特别彻底的分离。如果从社会行动流的视角来看，已完成事务的客观化只是短暂的客观化，立即通过将已完成事务纳入行动流来克服，那么资本主义就依赖于将那一短暂时刻转化为持久的客观化，将已完成事务转化为一个对象、一个独立的事物、可以定义为财产的东西。因此，资本主义意味着对“主体”和“客体”的新定义，其中“客体”与主体的行动持久且僵硬地分离。22 这并不意味着主体和客体是由资本主义构成的。主体性是固有于否定性（尖叫）中的，而否定性是固有于任何社会中的（当然是任何将行动置于他人从属中的社会）。然而，在资本主义下，主体和客体、行动者和已完成事物或被行动于的事物之间的分离获得了新的含义，导致了主体性和客体性的新定义和新意识，主体和客体之间的新距离和对立。因此，与其说主体是现代性的产物，不如说现代性表达了固有于将社会统治聚焦于已完成事务上的主体和客体新分离的意识。 23 用另一种方式表达同一观点是说，对象的构成与它的存在之间存在分离。已完成事务现在从构成它的行动中持久独立地存在。虽然从社会行动流的角度来看，一个对象的存在只是行动流中主体性构成（或行动）的短暂时刻，但资本主义依赖于将那一短暂时刻转化为持久的客观化。但当然，持久的独立是一种幻觉，一种非常真实的幻觉。已完成事务与行动的分离是一种真实的幻觉，一个真实的过程，在其中已完成事务从未停止依赖于行动。同样，存在与构成的分离是一种真实的幻觉，一个真实的过程，在其中存在从未停止依赖于构成。将已完成事务定义为私有财产是否定行动的社会性，但这也是一种真实的幻觉，一个真实的过程，在其中私有财产从未停止依赖于行动的社会性。行动的断裂并不意味着行动不再是社会性的，只是它变成了间接的社会性。 资本不是基于对人的所有权，而是基于对已完成事务的所有权，以此为基础，不断购买人们的行动能力。由于人们并不被拥有，他们可以很容易地拒绝为他人工作而不受任何直接惩罚。惩罚更多的是在于被切断与行动手段（和生存）的联系。因此，使用武力并不作为资本家与工人之间直接关系的一部分。武力的焦点首先不在行动者而在已完成的事物上：其焦点是保护财产，保护对已完成事务的所有权。武力不是由已完成事务的个体所有者行使，因为那将与资本家与工人之间关系的自由本质不相容，而是由一个负责保护已完成事务财产的独立实体，即国家，行使。因此，经济和政治之间的分离（以及通过这种分离对“经济”和“政治”作为不同形式的社会关系的构成）是资本主义下统治行使的核心。如果统治总是一种持械抢劫的过程，资本主义的特殊之处在于持枪的人与进行抢劫的人站在一边，只是监督抢劫是否符合法律。没有这种分离，已完成事务的财产（与仅仅是临时占有相对），因此资本主义本身，将是不可能的。这对权力的讨论很重要，因为经济与政治的分离使得政治看起来是权力行使的领域（将经济留作一个“自然”的、不容置疑的领域），而事实上权力的行使（将权力转化为对他人的权力）已经固有于已完成事务与行动的分离之中，因此固有于政治和经济作为不同形式的社会关系的构成之中（见帕夏卡尼斯1978年；霍洛威和皮恰托1977年，1978b年）。 权力转化为对他人的权力总是涉及到行动流的断裂，但在资本主义中，远远超过以往任何社会，行动流的断裂成为社会构建的原则。一个人根据对已完成事务的财产有权指挥他人行动的事实使得对行动流的断裂成为社会关系各个方面的核心。 行动流的断裂是一切的破碎。最明显的是，断裂的行动打破了集体的“我们”。集体被分为两类人：那些凭借对行动手段的所有权而指挥他人行动的人，以及那些因为被剥夺了进入行动手段的途径而做其他人吩咐他们做的人。行动的区分现在被前一类人，即行动手段的所有者所垄断。对于被告知该做什么的那些人来说，区分人与蜜蜂的投射与行动的统一被打破。换句话说，他们的人性被打破，被否定。主体性（投射与行动）被资本家占有（或者更准确的说，不那么是资本家，而是扭曲的资本关系）。被剥夺了投射与行动统一的行动者失去了他们的主体性，被降低到了蜜蜂的水平。他们成为了客观化的主体。他们也失去了他们的集体性，他们的“我们性”：我们被分裂成无数的“我”，或者更糟糕，被分裂成无数的“我”、“你”、“他”、“她”和“他们”。一旦社会行动流被打破，“我们性”也被打破。 投射与行动之间的断裂也是行动者与行动之间的断裂。行动是由非行动者（行动的指挥者）所命令的，因此对那些行动的人来说，行动变成了一种外在强加的、陌生的行动。他们的行动从一种主动的行动转变为一种被动的、遭受的、陌生的行动。行动变成了劳动。不是直接受他人命令的行动被与劳动分开，被视为不那么重要：“你做什么工作？”“哦，我什么都不做，我只是一个家庭主妇。” 行动者与行动、行动与已完成事物之间的分离是不断增长的分离。资本家对已完成事物（因此是对行动手段）的控制不断增长，积累和累积。资本主义统治集中于已完成事务而不是行动者的事实意味着它以一种与以行动者为中心的统治（奴隶制、封建制）不同的方式无休止地贪婪：“积累！积累！这是摩西和先知们的教导！”（马克思1965年，第595页）。不断驱动增加已完成事务的量化积累（死劳动，资本）强加了更快的行动节奏和对行动成果的更绝望的占有。已完成事物越来越多地支配着行动和行动者。 将已经完成的事物凝固成“东西”将行动流打碎成百万个碎片。东西性否定了行动（因此人性）的优先性。当我们使用电脑时，我们将其视为一件东西，而不是我们的写作与创造电脑的行动流的结合。东西性是凝固的健忘症。创造东西的行动（不仅仅是那个特定的行动，而是它所属的整个行动流）被遗忘了。东西现在独立存在，作为待售的商品，具有自己的价值。商品的价值是商品独立于行动的声明。创造商品的行动被遗忘，它所属的集体行动流被迫转入地下，变成了地下河流。价值获得了自己的生命。行动流的断裂被推向了极致。行动被推到了表面之下，与行动者一起，但不仅如此：那些行使权力凌驾于他人的人也被他们所基于的分裂推到了一边。资本主义社会里的主体不是资本家。决定事物、塑造所做事情的不是资本家。是价值。是资本，积累的价值。资本家“拥有”的东西——资本——将资本家推到了一边。他们只有在成为资本的忠诚仆人的程度上才是资本家。拥有权的重要性退居到了背景。资本获得了自己的动态，社会的领导成员实际上只不过是其最忠诚的仆人、最卑微的侍从。这不仅适用于资本家本身，也适用于政治家、公务员、教授等。行动流的断裂被推向了最荒谬的后果。权力凌驾于他人与有权力者分离。行动被否定，行动的凝固否定——价值——统治着世界。 行动不再是我们生活的编织，而是行动的否定——价值——以其可见且普遍的等价物——金钱——的形式编织我们的生活，或者更确切地说，将我们的生活撕裂，并将碎片重新粘合成一个破裂的整体。"},{"prompt":"请将“IV Power-to is inherently social and is transformed into its opposite, power-over, by the form of this sociality. Our capacity to do is unavoidably part of the social flow of doing, yet the fracturing of this flow subordinates this capacity to forces we do not control. Doing, then, exists antagonistically, as a doing turned against itself, as a doing dominated by the done, as a doing alienated from the doer. The antagonistic existence of doing can be formulated in different ways: as an antagonism between power-to and power-over, between doing and labour, between done and capital, between utility (use-value) and value, between social flow of doing and fragmentation. In each case there is a binary antagonism between the former and the latter, but it is not an external antagonism. In each case, the former exists as the latter: the latter is the mode of existence or form of the former. In each case, the latter denies the former, so that the former exists in the mode of being denied.27 In each case, the content (the former) is dominated by its form but exists in antagonistic tension with this form. This domination of form over content (of labour over doing, of capital over done, and so on) is the source of those horrors against which we scream. But what is the status of that which exists in the form of being denied? Does it exist at all? Where is power-to, where is unalienated doing, where is the social flow of doing? Do they have any sort of existence separate from the forms in which they currently exist? Are they not mere ideas, or romantic echoes of an imagined Golden Age? They are certainly not intended as a romantic harking back to a past age: whether there was ever a golden age of free doing (primitive communism) does not really matter to us now. They point not towards the past but towards a possible future: a future whose possibility depends on its real existence in the present. That which exists in the form of being denied exists, therefore and inevitably, in rebellion against this denial. There is no unalienated doing in the past, nor can it exist, hippie-like, in a present idyll: nevertheless, it exists, crucially, as present antagonism to its denial, as present projection-beyond-its-denial-to-a-different-world, as a presently existing not-yet.28 That which exists in the form of being denied is the substance of the ecstatic, the materiality of the scream, the truth which allows us to speak of the existing world as untrue. But it is more than that. The power-to that exists in the form of power-over, in the form, therefore, of being denied, exists not only as revolt against its denial, it exists also as material substratum of the denial. The denial cannot exist without that which is denied. The done depends on the doing.29 The owner of the done depends on the doer. No matter how much the done denies the existence of the doing, as in the case of value, as in the case of capital, there is no way in which the done can exist without the doing. No matter how much the done dominates the doing, it depends absolutely on that doing for its existence. Rulers, in other words, always depend on those whom they rule. Capital depends absolutely upon the labour which creates it (and therefore on the prior transformation of doing into labour). That which exists depends for its existence on that which exists only in the form of its denial. That is the weakness of any system of rule and the key to understanding its dynamic. That is the basis for hope. ‘Power’, then, is a confusing term which conceals an antagonism (and does so in a way that reflects the power of the powerful). ‘Power’ is used in two quite different senses, as power-to and as power-over. The problem is sometimes addressed in English by borrowing terms from other languages and making a distinction between potentia (power-to) and potestas (power-over).30 However, posing the distinction in these terms can be seen as pointing merely to a difference whereas what is at issue is an antagonism, or rather, an antagonistic metamorphosis. Power-to exists as power-over, but the power-to is subjected to and in rebellion against power-over, and power-over is nothing but, and therefore absolutely dependent upon, the metamorphosis of power-to. The struggle of the scream is the struggle to liberate power-to from power-over, the struggle to liberate doing from labour, to liberate subjectivity from its objectification. In this struggle, it is crucial to see that it is not a matter of power against power, of like against like. It is not a symmetrical struggle. The struggle to liberate power-to from power-over is the struggle for the reassertion of the social flow of doing, against its fragmentation and denial. On the one side is the struggle to re-braid our lives on the basis of the mutual recognition of our participation in the collective flow of doing; on the other side is the attempt to impose and reimpose the fragmentation of that flow, the denial of our doing. From the perspective of the scream, the Leninist aphorism that power is a matter of who-whom is absolutely false, as indeed is the Maoist saying that power comes out of the barrel of a gun: power-over may come out of the barrel of a gun, but not power-to. The struggle to liberate power-to is not the struggle to construct a counter-power, but rather an anti-power, something that is radically different from power-over. Concepts of revolution that focus on the taking of power are typically centred on the notion of counter-power. The strategy is to construct a counter-power, a power that can stand against the ruling power. Often the revolutionary movement has been constructed as a mirror image of power, army against army, party against party, with the result that power reproduces itself within the revolution itself. Anti-power, then, is not counter-power, but something much more radical: it is the dissolution of power-over, the emancipation of power-to. This is the great, absurd, inevitable challenge of the communist dream: to create a society free of power relations through the dissolution of power-over. This project is far more radical than any notion of revolution based on the conquest of power and at the same time far more realistic. Anti-power is fundamentally opposed to power-over not only in the sense of being a radically different project, but also in the fact that it exists in constant conflict with power-over. The attempt to exercise power-to in a way that does not entail the exercise of power over others, inevitably comes into conflict with power-over. Potentia is not an alternative to potestas that can simply coexist peacefully with it. It may appear that we can simply cultivate our own garden, create our own world of loving relations, refuse to get our hands dirty in the filth of power, but this is an illusion. There is no innocence, and this is true with an increasing intensity. The exercise of power-to in a way that does not focus on value creation can exist only in antagonism to power-over, as struggle. This is due not to the character of power-to (which is not inherently antagonistic) as to the voracious nature, the ‘were-wolf hunger’ (Marx 1965, p. 243) of power-over. Power-to, if it does not submerge itself in power-over, can exist, overtly or latently, only as power-against, as anti-power. It is important to stress the anti-ness of power-to under capitalism, because most mainstream discussions of social theory overlook the antagonistic nature of developing one’s potential. The antagonistic nature of power is overlooked and it is assumed that capitalist society provides the opportunity to develop human potential (power-to) to the full. Money, if it is seen as being relevant at all (and, amazingly, it is generally not mentioned in discussions of power, presumably on the basis that money is economics and power is sociology), is generally seen in terms of inequality (unequal access to resources, for example), rather than in terms of command. Power-to, it is assumed, is already emancipated. The same point can be made in relation to subjectivity. The fact that power-to can exist only as antagonism to power-over (as anti-power) means of course that, under capitalism, subjectivity can only exist antagonistically, in opposition to its own objectification. To treat the subject as already emancipated, as most mainstream theory does, is to endorse the present objectification of the subject as subjectivity, as freedom. Many of the attacks on subjectivity by structuralists or postmodernists can perhaps be understood in this sense, as attacks on a false notion of an emancipated (and hence autonomous and coherent) subjectivity.31 To argue here for the inevitability of taking subjectivity as our starting point is not to argue for a coherent or autonomous subjectivity. On the contrary, the fact that subjectivity can exist only in antagonism to its own objectification means that it is torn apart by that objectification and its struggle against it. This book is an exploration of the absurd and shadowy world of anti-power. It is shadowy and absurd simply because the world of orthodox social science (sociology, political science, economics, and so on) is a world in which power is so completely taken for granted that nothing else is visible. In the social science that seeks to explain the world as it is, to show how the world works, power is the keystone of all categories, so that, in spite of (indeed, because of) its proclaimed neutrality, this social science participates actively in the separation of subject and object which is the substance of power. To us, power is of interest only in so far as it helps us to understand the challenge of anti-power: the study of power on its own, in abstraction from the challenge and project of anti-power, can do nothing but actively reproduce power. V We have presented the issue of power in terms of a binary antagonism between doing and done, in which the done, existing in the form of capital (apparently controlled by, but actually in control of, the capitalists) subordinates, ever more voraciously, all doing to the sole purpose of its self-expansion. But is this not too simple? Surely that which we scream against is far more complex than this? What about the way that doctors treat their patients, what about the way that teachers treat their students, that parents treat their children? What of the treatment of blacks by whites? What about the subordination of women to men? Is it not too simplistic, too reductionist, to say that power is capital and capital is power? Are there not many different types of power? Foucault in particular makes the argument that it is a mistake to think of power in terms of a binary antagonism, that we must think of it rather in terms of a ‘multiplicity of force relations’ (1990, p. 92). Corresponding to the multiplicity of power relations there is then a multiplicity of resistances … present everywhere in the power network. Hence there is no single locus of great Refusal, no soul of revolt, source of all rebellions, or pure law of the revolutionary. Instead there is a plurality of resistances, each of them a special case: resistances that are possible, necessary, improbable; others that are spontaneous, savage, solitary, concerted, rampant, or violent; still others that are quick to compromise, interested, or sacrificial; by definition, they can only exist in the strategic field of power relations. [1990, pp. 95–6]”翻译为中文","completion":"IV 权力（权能）本质上是社会性的，它通过这种社会性的形式被转化为其对立面，即权力凌驾于他人。我们的行动能力不可避免地是社会行动流的一部分，然而这一流的断裂使这种能力从属于我们无法控制的力量。 因此，行动以一种对立的方式存在，作为一种对抗自身的行动，一个被已完成的事物所主导的行动，一个与行动者疏离的行动。行动的对立存在可以用不同的方式来表述：作为权力（权能）与权力（凌驾）之间的对立，行动与劳动之间的对立，已完成的事物与资本之间的对立，效用（使用价值）与价值之间的对立，社会行动流与碎片化之间的对立。在每种情况下，前者与后者之间都存在二元对立，但这并非外在的对立。在每种情况下，前者以后者的形式存在：后者是前者的存在方式或形态。在每种情况下，后者否定前者，因此前者以被否定的方式存在。在每种情况下，内容（前者）被其形式所主导，但与这种形式存在着对抗性的紧张关系。形式对内容的主导（劳动凌驾于行动，资本凌驾于已完成的事物等等）是我们尖叫反抗的恐怖源头。 但被以否定的形式存在的是什么状态呢？它到底存在吗？权力（权能）在哪里，非异化的行动在哪里，社会行动流在哪里？它们是否拥有与目前存在形式分离的任何实质性存在？难道它们不仅仅是想法，或者过去黄金时代的浪漫回响吗？当然，这些并不是对过去时代的浪漫追忆：无论是否真的存在过自由行动的黄金时代（原始共产主义）对我们现在而言并不重要。它们指向的不是过去而是可能的未来：这个未来的可能性依赖于它在现在的真实存在。因此，以被否定的形式存在的东西，不可避免地以反抗这种否定的形式存在。在过去没有非异化的行动，也不可能以嬉皮士般的方式存在于一种现实的田园诗中：然而，它以当前对其否定的反抗、对不同世界的当前超越性投射、作为当前存在的未来潜能的关键方式存在。以被否定的形式存在的东西是狂喜的实质，尖叫的物质性，使我们能够谈论现存世界作为非真实的真理。 但它不仅如此。以权力凌驾于他人的形式存在的权力（权能），因此，以被否定的形式存在的权力（权能），不仅作为对其否定的反抗而存在，它还作为否定的物质基础而存在。否定的存在不能没有被否定的事物。已完成的事物依赖于行动。已完成的事物的所有者依赖于行动者。无论已完成的事物如何否定行动的存在，如同价值的情况，如同资本的情况，已完成的事物无法没有行动而存在。无论已完成的事物如何主导行动，它都绝对依赖于那个行动以求生存。换句话说，统治者总是依赖于他们所统治的人。资本绝对依赖于创造它的劳动（因此依赖于行动转化为劳动的先决条件）。存在的一切依赖于以其否定的形式存在的东西以求生存。这是任何统治体系的弱点所在，也是理解其动态的关键。这是希望的基础。 因此，“权力”是一个混淆的术语，它隐藏了一种对立（这种隐藏方式反映了掌权者的权力）。我们将“权力”用于两种完全不同的含义：作为权力（权能）和作为权力（凌驾）。有时通过借用其他语言的术语并区分potentia（权力）和potestas（权力凌驾于他人）来解决这个问题。然而，用这些术语提出区分往往只是指向一种差异，而争论的是一种内在的对立，或者更确切地说，一种对立性的转化。权力（权能）以权力（凌驾）的形式存在，但权力（权能）受到权力（凌驾）的压迫并反抗之，而权力（凌驾）只不过是权力（权能）的一种转化形式，因此绝对依赖于权力（权能）的转化。 尖叫的斗争是将权力（权能）从权力（凌驾）中解放出来的斗争，是将行动从劳动中解放出来，将主体性从其客体化中解放出来的斗争。在这场斗争中，关键是要看到这不是一种权力对抗权力，不是同类之间的对抗。这不是一个对称的斗争。将权力（权能）从权力（凌驾）中解放出来的斗争是重新建立社会行动流的斗争，对抗其碎片化和否定。一方面是基于相互认可我们在集体行动流中的参与来重构我们生活的斗争；另一方面是试图强加和重新强加那种流的碎片化，即我们行动的否定。从尖叫的视角来看，列宁的权力是关于谁对谁的主张是绝对错误的，毛泽东的权力来自枪杆子的说法也是如此：权力（凌驾）可能来自枪杆子，但权力（权能）不会。解放权力（权能）的斗争不是建立一个反权力的斗争，而是反权力的斗争，是与权力（凌驾）截然不同的东西。侧重于夺取权力的革命观念通常以反权力的概念为中心。策略是建立一个反权力，一个能够对抗统治权力的权力。革命运动往往被构建为权力的镜像，军队对抗军队，党对抗党，结果权力在革命本身内部再现。因此，反权力不是反权力，而是更为激进的东西：它是对权力（凌驾）的解散，是对权力（权能）的解放。这是共产主义梦想的伟大、荒谬、不可避免的挑战：通过解散权力（凌驾）而创建一个没有权力关系的社会。这个项目比任何基于夺取权力的革命观念更为激进，同时也更为现实。 反权力不仅因为是一个根本不同的项目而与权力（凌驾）截然相反，而且还在于它与权力（凌驾）存在持续冲突的事实。试图以不涉及对他人行使权力（凌驾）的方式行使权力（权能），不可避免地会与权力（凌驾）发生冲突。Potentia并不是一个可以与potestas简单和平共存的替代选项。我们可能会觉得，我们可以简单地培育自己的花园，创造自己的爱的世界，拒绝让自己的手在权力的污垢中变脏，但这是一种幻觉。没有纯洁无辜，而且这种情况越来越激烈。以不以价值创造为焦点的方式行使权力（权能），只能以对抗权力（凌驾）的斗争形式存在，不论是公开的还是潜在的。这是由于权力（凌驾）的贪婪本质，其“狼般的饥饿”（马克思1965年，第243页），而不是由于权力（权能）的性质（本质上并不是对立的）。如果权力（权能）不将自己沉浸在权力（凌驾）之中，它只能明显或潜在地作为反抗力量、反权力而存在。 强调资本主义下权力（权能）的反对性很重要，因为大多数主流的社会理论讨论忽视了发展个人潜能的对抗性本质。权力的对抗性本质被忽视，人们假设资本主义社会提供了充分发展人类潜能（权力权能）的机会。如果金钱被视为相关的（令人惊讶的是，在讨论权力时，金钱通常不被提及，大概是因为金钱属于经济学而权力属于社会学），它通常被视为不平等的表现（例如，获取资源的不平等机会），而不是作为命令的表现。人们假设权力（权能）已经获得了解放。 对于主体性而言，也可以提出同样的观点。权力（权能）只能以对抗权力（凌驾）（作为反权力）的形式存在的事实当然意味着，在资本主义下，主体性只能以对抗自身客体化的对立形式存在。像大多数主流理论那样将主体视为已经解放出来，就是对现有主体客体化作为主体性、自由的背书。许多对主体性的攻击，无论是结构主义者还是后现代主义者，或许可以被理解为对一个虚假解放主体性（因此是自主和连贯的主体性）概念的攻击。在这里主张以主体性作为我们的出发点是不可避免的，并不是在主张一个连贯或自主的主体性。相反，主体性只能在与自身客体化的对抗中存在的事实意味着它被这种客体化及其抵抗所撕裂。 本书是对反权力这个荒谬和阴影世界的探索。之所以说它荒谬和阴影，是因为在正统社会科学（社会学、政治学、经济学等）的世界中，权力被如此理所当然地接受，以至于没有其他东西是可见的。在旨在解释世界如何运作的社会科学中，权力是所有范畴的基石，因此，尽管（实际上，正是因为）它宣称自己的中立，这种社会科学积极参与了构成权力实质的主体与客体的分离。对我们来说，权力只在它帮助我们理解反权力的挑战方面才有兴趣：单独研究权力，抽象于反权力的挑战和项目，只会积极再现权力。 V 我们已经以行动与已完成事物之间的二元对立来呈现权力问题，在这种对立中，以资本的形式存在的已完成事物（表面上由资本家控制，但实际上控制着资本家）不断贪婪地将所有行动从属于其自身扩张的唯一目的。 但这是不是太简单了？我们所反抗的东西难道不是远比这更复杂吗？医生对待病人的方式，教师对待学生的方式，父母对待孩子的方式如何呢？对待黑人与白人的方式呢？对女性的从属于男性呢？将权力等同于资本，资本等同于权力，是不是太过简化、太过还原主义了？难道不是有许多不同类型的权力吗？ 尤其是福柯认为，将权力视为二元对立的方式是错误的，我们必须将其视为“力量关系的多样性”（1990年，第92页）。与权力关系的多样性相对应，就是同样多样的抵抗 ……存在于权力网络的每一个地方。因此，没有一个伟大的拒绝的单一地点，没有反叛的灵魂，所有叛乱的来源，或革命的纯粹法则。相反，存在着多样性的抵抗，每一种都是特殊的情况：可能的、必要的、不太可能的抵抗；自发的、野性的、孤独的、协同的、猖獗的或暴力的抵抗；还有那些迅速妥协的、有利益的或牺牲的抵抗；根据定义，它们只能存在于权力关系的战略领域中。[1990年，第95-96页]"},{"prompt":"请将“In terms of our scream, that would suggest an endless multiplicity of screams. And indeed it is so: we scream in many different ways and for many different reasons. From the beginning of our argument it was stressed that the ‘we-ness’ of ‘we scream’ is a central question in this book, not a simple assertion of identity. Why, then, insist on the binary nature of an overriding antagonism between doing and done? It cannot be a matter of an abstract defence of a Marxist approach – that would make no sense. Nor is it in any sense the intention to impose a single identity or unity upon the manifest multiplicity of resistance, to subordinate all the variety of resistances to the a priori unity of the Working Class. Nor can it be a matter of emphasising the empirical role of the working class and its importance in relation to ‘other forms of struggle’. In order to explain our insistence on the binary nature of the antagonism of power (or, in more traditional terms, our insistence on a class analysis), it is necessary to retrace our steps. The starting-point of the argument here is not the urge to understand society or to explain how it works. Our starting-point is much sharper: the scream, the drive to change society radically. It is from that perspective that we ask how society works. That starting-point led us to place the question of doing in the centre of our discussion, and this in turn led us to the antagonism between doing and done. Obviously, other perspectives are possible. It is more common to start positively, with the question of how society works. Such a perspective does not necessarily lead to a focus on doing and the way in which doing is organised. In the case of Foucault, it leads rather to a focus on talking, on language. This perspective certainly allows him to elucidate the enormous richness and complexity of power relations in contemporary society and, more important from our perspective, the richness and complexity of resistance to power. However, the richness and complexity is the richness of a still photograph, or of a painting.32 There is no movement in the society that Foucault analyses: change from one still photograph to another, but no movement. There cannot be, unless the focus is on doing and its antagonistic existence. Thus, in Foucault’s analysis, there are a whole host of resistances which are integral to power, but there is no possibility of emancipation. The only possibility is an endlessly shifting constellation of power-and-resistance. The argument in this chapter has led to two important results, which it is worth reiterating. First, the focus on doing has led to an intimation of the vulnerability of power-over. The done depends on the doer, capital depends on labour. That is the crucial chink of light, the glimmer of hope, the turning-point in the argument. The realisation that the powerful depend on the ‘powerless’33 transforms the scream from a scream of anger to a scream of hope, a confident scream of anti-power (see Holloway 1995a). This realisation takes us beyond the merely radical-democratic perspective of an endless struggle against power to a position from which we can pose the issue of the vulnerability of capital and the real possibility of social transformation. From this perspective, then, we must ask of any theory not so much how it illuminates the present, but what light it throws on the vulnerability of rule. What we want is not a theory of domination, but a theory of the vulnerability of domination, of the crisis of domination, as an expression of our own (anti-)power. The emphasis on understanding power in terms of a ‘multiplicity of relations of force’ does not give us any basis for posing this question. Indeed, on the contrary, it tends to exclude the question, for, while resistance is central to Foucault’s approach (at least in his later work), the notion of emancipation is ruled out as being absurd, for it presupposes, as Foucault correctly points out, the assumption of a unity in the relations of power. To pose the question of the vulnerability of power thus requires two steps: the opening of the category of power to reveal its contradictory character, which has been described here in terms of the antagonism between power-to and power-over; and second, the understanding of this antagonistic relation as an internal relation. Power-to exists as power-over: power-over is the form of power-to, a form which denies its substance. Power-over can exist only as transformed power-to. Capital can exist only as the product of transformed doing (labour). That is the key to its weakness. The issue of form, so central to Marx’s discussion of capitalism, is crucial for an understanding of the vulnerability of domination. The distinction which Negri makes (and develops so brilliantly) between constituent and constituted power takes the first of these two steps and opens up an understanding of the self-antagonistic nature of power as a precondition for talking about revolutionary transformation (see Negri 1999). However, the relation between constituent and constituted power remains an external one. Constitution (the transformation of constituent into constituted power) is seen as a reaction to the democratic constituent power of the multitude. This, however, tells us nothing about the vulnerability of the process of constitution. In the face of power-over (constituted power) it tells us of the ubiquity and force of the absolute struggle of the multitude, but it tells us nothing of the crucial nexus of dependence of power-over (constituted power) upon power-to (constituent power). In this sense, for all the force and brilliance of his account, Negri remains at the level of radical-democratic theory.34 Does this emphasis on the perspective of the scream lead us then to an impoverished view of society? The argument above seems to suggest that the perspective of the scream leads to a binary view of the antagonism between doing and done, and that in such a perspective there is no room for the ‘multiplicity of forces’ which Foucault sees as essential to the discussion of power. This seems to suggest a split between the revolutionary or negative perspective and the understanding of the undoubted richness and complexity of society. This would indeed be the case (and would constitute a major problem for our argument) if it were not for the second result of our previous discussion, namely that the antagonistic relation between doing and done, and specifically the radical fracturing of the flow of doing that is inherent in the fact that power-over exists as ownership of the done, means a multiple fragmentation of doing (and of social relations). In other words, the very understanding of social relations as being characterised by a binary antagonism between doing and done means that this antagonism exists in the form of a multiplicity of antagonisms, a great heterogeneity of conflict. There are indeed a million forms of resistance, an immensely complex world of antagonisms. To reduce these to an empirical unity of conflict between capital and labour, or to argue for a hegemony of working-class struggle, understood empirically, or to argue that these apparently non-class resistances must be subsumed under class struggle, would be an absurd violence. The argument here is just the contrary: the fact that capitalist society is characterised by a binary antagonism between doing and done means that this antagonism exists as a multiplicity of antagonisms. It is the binary nature of power (as antagonism between power-to and power-over) that means that power appears as a ‘multiplicity of forces’. Rather than starting with the multiplicity, we need to start with the prior multiplication that gives rise to this multiplicity. Rather than starting with the multiple identities (women, blacks, gays, Basques, Irish, and so on), we need to start from the process of identification that gives rise to those identities. In this perspective, one aspect of Foucault’s enormously stimulating writings is precisely that, without presenting it in those terms, he greatly enriches our understanding of the fragmentation of the flow of doing, our historical understanding of what we shall characterise in the next chapter as the process of fetishisation. A last point needs to be dealt with before passing on to the discussion of fetishism. It is an important part of Foucault’s argument that power should not be seen in purely negative terms, that we must also understand the way in which power constitutes reality and constitutes us. That is clearly so: we are conceived and born not in a power-free vacuum but in a power-traversed society: we are products of that society. Foucault, however, fails to open up the category of power, to point to the fundamental antagonism that characterises it. Thus, we can say, for example, that we are products of capital, or that everything we consume is a commodity. That is clearly so, but it is deceptive. It is only when we open up these categories, when we say, for example, that the commodity is characterised by an antagonism between value and use value (utility), that use value exists in the form of value, and in rebellion against this form, that the full development of our human potential presupposes our participation in this rebellion, and so on. It is only then that we can make sense of the statement that everything we consume is a commodity. Similarly with power: it is only when we open up the category of power and see power-over as the antagonistic form of power-to that it makes sense to say that power constitutes us. The power that constitutes us is an antagonism, an antagonism of which we are profoundly and inevitably part. 4 Fetishism: The Tragic Dilemma I In the last chapter, we argued that the transformation of power-to into power-over is centred on the rupture of the social flow of doing. In capitalism, the done is severed from and turned against the doing. This severing of the done from the doing is the core of a multiple fracturing of all aspects of life. Without naming names, we have already entered upon a discussion of fetishism. Fetishism is the term that Marx uses to describe the rupture of doing. Fetishism is the core of Marx’s discussion of power and central to any discussion of changing the world. It is the centrepiece of the argument of this book. Fetishism is a category that does not fit easily into normal academic discourse. Partially for that reason, it has been relatively neglected by those who would force Marxism into the moulds of the different academic disciplines. Although it is a central category in Marx’s Capital, it is almost completely ignored by those who regard themselves as Marxist economists.1 It is similarly overlooked by Marxist sociologists and political scientists, who usually prefer to start from the category of class and adapt it to the frameworks of their disciplines. Fetishism, in so far as it is discussed at all, is often seen as falling in the realm of philosophy or cultural criticism. Relegated and classified in this way, the concept loses its explosive force. The force of the concept lies in that it refers to an unsustainable horror: the self-negation of doing. II The young Marx discusses the self-negation of doing not in terms of fetishism but in terms of ‘alienation’ or ‘estrangement’. Alienation, a term now often used to describe a general social malaise, refers in Marx’s discussion to the rupturing of doing which is characteristic of the capitalist organisation of production. In his discussion of ‘estranged labour’ in the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, Marx starts from the process of production, arguing that under capitalism production is not just production of an object, but production of an object that is alien to the producer: ”翻译为中文","completion":"IV 从我们的尖叫出发，这似乎意味着无尽的尖叫多样性。的确如此：我们以许多不同的方式、出于许多不同的原因尖叫。从我们的论证一开始就强调，“我们尖叫”的“我们性”是本书的一个核心问题，不是简单的身份声明。那么，为什么要坚持在行动与已完成的事物之间存在一个主导性的二元对立呢？这不可能是为了抽象地捍卫马克思主义方法——那将毫无意义。也绝不是试图对明显的抵抗多样性强加单一的身份或统一性，将所有抵抗的多样性从属于工人阶级的先验统一性。也不能是强调工人阶级的经验角色及其相对于“其他形式的斗争”的重要性。 为了解释我们坚持权力对立的二元性（或用更传统的术语，坚持阶级分析）的必要性，有必要回顾我们的步骤。这里的论证出发点不是理解社会或解释它如何运作。我们的出发点更为尖锐：尖叫，彻底改变社会的驱动。正是从这个视角，我们询问社会如何运作。这一出发点将行动的问题置于我们讨论的中心，这反过来又将我们引向了行动与已完成的事物之间的对立。 显然，其他视角是可能的。更常见的是从如何运作的积极问题出发。这样的视角不一定会导致对行动及其组织方式的关注。在福柯的案例中，这反而导致对谈话、对语言的关注。这一视角无疑让他阐明了当代社会权力关系的巨大丰富性和复杂性，更重要的是，从我们的视角来看，对权力的抵抗的丰富性和复杂性。然而，这种丰富性和复杂性是静态照片或绘画的丰富性。福柯分析的社会中没有运动：从一个静态照片过渡到另一个，但没有运动。除非关注点在于行动及其对立的存在，否则不可能有运动。因此，在福柯的分析中，有很多抵抗与权力密不可分，但没有解放的可能性。唯一的可能性是权力与抵抗不断变化的星座。 本章的论证得出了两个重要结果，值得重申。首先，对行动的关注引出了权力凌驾于他人的脆弱性。已完成的事物依赖于行动者，资本依赖于劳动。这是至关重要的一线光明，希望的一丝曙光，论证的转折点。认识到有权力者依赖于“无权力者”将尖叫从愤怒的尖叫转变为希望的尖叫，一个自信的反权力的尖叫（见Holloway 1995a）。这一认识使我们超越了仅仅以权力永久斗争的激进民主观点，站在了一个能够提出资本脆弱性和社会转型的真正可能性的立场上。因此，我们必须询问任何理论，不仅是它如何阐明现状，而且是它对统治脆弱性投射了什么光。我们需要的不是统治理论，而是统治脆弱性理论，统治危机理论，作为我们自己（反）权力的表达。以“力量关系的多样性”理解权力，并未为我们提出这一问题提供任何基础。事实上，相反，它倾向于排除这一问题，因为，尽管抵抗是福柯方法的核心（至少在他后期的作品中），但解放的概念被排除在外，被视为荒谬，因为它预设了，正如福柯正确指出的，权力关系的统一性。 因此，提出权力脆弱性的问题需要两个步骤：打开权力的范畴以揭示其矛盾本质，这里用权力（权能）与权力（凌驾）之间的对立来描述；第二，将这种对立关系理解为内在关系。权力（权能）以权力（凌驾）的形式存在：权力（凌驾）是权力（权能）的形式，一种否定其实质的形式。权力（凌驾）只能作为转化了的权力（权能）而存在。资本只能作为转化了的行动（劳动）的产物而存在。这是其脆弱性的关键。形式问题，马克思对资本主义讨论的核心，对于理解统治脆弱性至关重要。内格里在区分构成性权力和已构成权力时所作的区分（并且如此精彩地发展）采取了这两个步骤中的第一个，并开启了对权力自我对立本质的理解，作为讨论革命转型的前提（见Negri 1999）。然而，构成性权力与已构成权力之间的关系仍然是外在的。构成（将构成性权力转化为已构成权力）被视为对民众民主构成性权力的反应。然而，这并没有告诉我们关于构成过程脆弱性的任何信息。面对权力凌驾于他人（已构成权力），它告诉我们民众绝对斗争的无处不在和力量，但它没有告诉我们权力凌驾于他人（已构成权力）对权力（权能）（构成性权力）的至关重要的依赖关系。在这个意义上，尽管内格里的论述力量和光彩四射，但他仍然停留在激进民主理论的层面。34 那么，这种对尖叫的视角是否导致了我们对社会的贫乏看法呢？上述论点似乎表明，尖叫的视角导致了行动与已完成的事物之间对立的二元视图，并且在这样的视角中，没有空间容纳福柯视为讨论权力所必需的“力量多样性”。这似乎表明了激进或否定性视角与对社会无可否认的丰富性和复杂性的理解之间的分裂。如果确实如此（这将构成我们论证的一个重大问题），那么只有当我们考虑到上一次讨论的第二个结果时，这种情况才不会出现，即行动与已完成的事物之间的对立关系，特别是权力凌驾于他人以对已完成的事物的所有权为中心的事实所固有的对社会行动流的激烈断裂，意味着行动（和社会关系）的多重碎片化。换句话说，正是社会关系被特征化为行动与已完成的事物之间的二元对立，意味着这种对立以多样性的对立、众多冲突的异质性的形式存在。的确存在数以百万计的抵抗形式，一个极其复杂的冲突世界。将这些冲突简化为资本与劳动之间的经验统一性的冲突，或为工人阶级斗争的霸权辩护，理解为经验上的，或者说这些表面上非阶级的抵抗必须被归入阶级斗亮下，将是一种荒谬的暴力。这里的论点恰恰相反：资本主义社会以行动与已完成的事物之间的二元对立为特征，意味着这种对立以多样性的对立形式存在。正是权力的二元性（作为权力（权能）与权力（凌驾）之间的对立）意味着权力显现为“力量多样性”。我们不是从多样性开始，而是从产生这种多样性的先前的倍增开始。我们不是从多重身份（女性、黑人、同性恋者、巴斯克人、爱尔兰人等）开始，而是从产生这些身份的认同过程开始。从这个视角来看，福柯的一些极具启发性的著作恰恰是因为，虽然没有用这些术语呈现，但它们极大地丰富了我们对行动流碎片化的理解，我们对下一章将要描述的拜物教过程的历史性理解。 在讨论拜物教之前，还有一个重要观点需要处理。福柯认为的一个重要部分是，权力不应仅以消极术语来看待，我们还必须了解权力如何构成现实和构成我们自己。这显然是这样：我们的构思和出生并不是在一个没有权力的真空中，而是在一个充满权力的社会中：我们是那个社会的产物。然而，福柯没有打开权力的范畴，没有指向其固有的基本对立。因此，我们可以说，例如，我们是资本的产物，或者我们消费的一切都是商品。这显然是这样，但这是具有欺骗性的。只有当我们打开这些范畴，当我们说，例如，商品的特征是价值与使用价值（效用）之间的对立，使用价值以价值的形式存在，并反抗这种形式，我们人类潜能的充分发展预设了我们参与这种反抗，等等。只有这样，我们才能理解我们消费的一切都是商品的陈述。同样地，只有当我们打开权力的范畴，看到权力（凌驾）作为权力（权能）的对立形式时，说权力构成了我们才有意义。构成我们的权力是一种对立，我们深刻而不可避免地成为这种对立的一部分。 本书是对反权力这个荒谬和阴影世界的探索。之所以说它荒谬和阴影，是因为在正统社会科学（社会学、政治学、经济学等）的世界中，权力被如此理所当然地接受，以至于没有其他东西是可见的。在旨在解释世界如何运作的社会科学中，权力是所有范畴的基石，因此，尽管（实际上，正是因为）它宣称自己的中立，这种社会科学积极参与了构成权力实质的主体与客体的分离。对我们来说，权力只在它帮助我们理解反权力的挑战方面才有兴趣：单独研究权力，抽象于反权力的挑战和项目，只会积极再现权力。 V 在上一章中，我们论证了权力（权能）转化为权力（凌驾）是以社会行动流的断裂为中心的。在资本主义中，已完成的事物与行动被割裂并转化为对行动的对抗。已完成的事物与行动的割裂是生活各个方面多重碎片化的核心。 我们已经进入了拜物教讨论的范畴，尽管没有点名。拜物教是马克思用来描述行动断裂的术语。拜物教是马克思权力讨论的核心，也是任何改变世界讨论的核心。它是本书论证的中心。 拜物教是一个不容易融入常规学术话语的范畴。部分原因是，它相对于那些试图将马克思主义塑造成不同学术领域模式的人而言，被相对忽视。尽管它是马克思《资本论》的一个中心范畴，它几乎被自认为是马克思主义经济学家的人完全忽视。同样地，马克思主义社会学家和政治学家也常常忽视它，他们通常更喜欢从阶级范畴出发，并将其调整到他们学科的框架中。就连讨论拜物教的时候，通常也被视为属于哲学或文化批评的范畴。如此被降级和分类，这一概念失去了其爆炸性的力量。 这一概念的力量在于它指向了一种无法维系的恐怖：行动的自我否定。 II 年轻的马克思在讨论自我否定的行动时，并没有使用拜物教这个术语，而是用“异化”或“疏离”来描述。异化，这个现在常用来描述一种普遍的社会不适的术语，在马克思的讨论中指的是资本主义生产组织特有的行动断裂。 在1844年的《经济学哲学手稿》中讨论“异化劳动”时，马克思从生产过程出发，认为在资本主义下生产不仅是对象的生产，而是生产一种对生产者来说是外来的对象："},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Is there a difference between the 2012 and 2024 job interview phase? Or are companies searching for the same things? Ranveer, there\'s a huge difference. At that time, because education wasn\'t that democratized, there wasn\'t that much knowledge available on YouTube, so the skill bar was low. If IIT wasn\'t teaching me business management, Company doesn\'t expect that Swati knows all about digital marketing, product management. But now companies say that if you want to learn, then everything is on YouTube, everything is on Coursera. So you should know. So a skill bar has been raised. Secondly, companies have changed. In those days, MNCs used to come for the topmost job. Now let\'s come to startups. We have so many unicorn startups. Flipkart, Zomato. But these companies have a startup culture. Where they are saying that we don\'t have enough time to train you. So now train yourself. Because they don\'t have such long training modules. So I see that many people who haven\'t gone to IIT or IIM. But because they have polished their skills. They are doing very well in these companies. So one, skill bar has increased. Second, value of pedigree has decreased a little. Meaning? Meaning, if you see globally, Amazon, Google, Walmart, everyone has said that our requirement is not that you have a bachelor\'s degree. You apply. We will take you through our process. If you crack that process, then you are in. Earlier, this didn\'t happen. Earlier, paperwork used to happen. That which is the bachelor\'s degree. Even now maybe degree is an indication. But companies have become very open. And the world has moved to a skill oriented market. Rather than a degree oriented market. So now when I also hire. So I don\'t look at which college you are from. You will get an indication. Okay so the child is a hard worker. If he is from IIT. But if he doesn\'t know how to run Excel. Doesn\'t know how to make slides in PowerPoint. Which is not in IIT\'s curriculum. So, maybe I shouldn\'t select that. Okay. This might be my conjecture. Or, maybe I\'m genuinely saying this. If my own kids were teenagers today. They\'re not my own kids, by the way. But, hypothetically. If my own teenagers were, I would probably enroll them in your college. That\'s what I think. Because, that\'s the need of the hour. Because, the people who are in their 30s, especially, you\'re a seasoned entrepreneur. Plus, you\'ve done corporate work. the best part of the world. Consultant job. You know what you\'re doing in terms of the job market. So, even then, when I was in college and I needed career advice, only people of age 30 gave me the right advice. Because they know what\'s going on. If you liked this clip, then like this, 1000 clips have been uploaded on this channel.

Here are some potential impacts and considerations: 1. **Complexity in Balance:** Balancing would become an incredibly complex task. Overwatch\'s balance is already intricate, with each hero designed to have specific strengths, weaknesses, and roles within a team. Allowing weapon swaps would require rethinking this balance, as the combination of certain weapons with certain heroes\' abilities could lead to overpowered combinations or unintended interactions. 2. **Meta Shifts:** The game\'s meta, or the prevailing strategy that players use to win matches, would shift dramatically. Heroes who currently have weaker primary weapons but strong abilities might become overwhelmingly powerful with access to more potent firearms. Conversely, heroes whose strength lies in their weapon might lose their advantage if their weapon could be used by others. 3. **Strategic Depth and Innovation:** This change could introduce a new level of strategic depth and innovation. Teams would need to think even more critically about compositions and the interplay between different heroes\' abilities and the weapons they could potentially wield. It could create a more dynamic game where adaptability and strategy trump mere mechanical skill. 4. **Learning Curve:** The learning curve for new and existing players could steepen significantly. Players would need to understand not only each hero\'s abilities and typical role but also how those abilities could synergize with any possible weapon in the game. This could make the game more challenging for newcomers and casual players. 5. **Gameplay Diversity:** Matches would likely become more unpredictable and diverse, as the number of potential hero and weapon combinations would dramatically increase. This could keep the gameplay fresh and exciting for longer periods, as players experiment with new combinations and strategies. 6. **Technical and UI Challenges:** Implementing such a feature would pose significant technical and user interface (UI) challenges. The game would need to include a way for players to exchange weapons efficiently during matches, which could clutter the UI or make the gameplay confusing. Also, animating every hero with every potential weapon would require a substantial amount of work. 7. **Community Reception:** The reception to such a drastic change would likely be mixed. While some players might enjoy the chaos and creativity that weapon swapping could introduce, others might prefer the predictability and balance of the current system.

Today marks the first day of my term, a day to set the tone for my presidency. **Morning Briefing** It\'s 7:00 am, and I start my day with a briefing from my chief of staff in the Palácio do Planalto. The agenda is packed: an economy in need of stimulation, environmental challenges that threaten the Amazon, a populace divided, and an international community watching my every move. **Economic Policy Proposal** Faced with the task of revitalizing the Brazilian economy, I decide my first act in office will be to propose a new economic policy aimed at sustainable growth. This policy focuses on supporting local businesses, investing in technology and renewable energy, and creating incentives for foreign investment without sacrificing environmental regulations.

You request a comprehensive economic report from your finance minister. Here\'s an overview reflecting the situation based on available data up to your knowledge cutoff in 2023: --- **Comprehensive Economic Report of Brazil** **Economic Overview:** Brazil stands as the largest economy in South America and one of the largest in the emerging global market. However, the economy faces several challenges, including modest growth rates, a complex tax system, and concerns related to public debt and unemployment. **GDP Growth:** - The Brazilian economy has shown resilience, with a post-pandemic recovery leading to modest GDP growth. However, growth rates are below the global average and those of other emerging economies. - The service sector remains the largest component of the GDP, followed by industry and agriculture. **Inflation and Monetary Policy:** - Inflation has been a significant concern, with rates that have surpassed the Central Bank\'s target range. This has led to tighter monetary policies, with increases in the benchmark interest rate (SELIC) in attempts to curb inflation. - High-interest rates have implications for domestic investment and consumer spending. **Fiscal Policy and Public Debt:** - Brazil\'s public debt-to-GDP ratio remains high, though there have been efforts to stabilize it through fiscal discipline measures. - The complexity of the tax system and bureaucratic hurdles stand as significant challenges for doing business in Brazil, impacting both domestic and foreign investment. **Unemployment and Labor Market:** - Unemployment rates have been gradually decreasing but remain high compared to historical levels. The pandemic exacerbated these challenges, though there\'s been some recovery. - Informality in the labor market remains a concern, affecting workers\' rights and access to social benefits. **Trade and Investment:** - Brazil maintains a diverse trade portfolio, exporting commodities (e.g., soybeans, iron ore, crude oil) and manufacturing goods while importing technology and machinery. - Efforts to negotiate trade agreements and improve the investment climate are crucial for future growth, especially in fostering innovation and sustainable development. **Social Challenges:** - Income inequality and poverty are persistent social issues. Economic policies need to address these challenges to ensure inclusive growth. - Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to the Amazon rainforest, is globally significant. Balancing conservation efforts with economic development is a key challenge. **Strategic Recommendations:** 1. **Tax Reform**: Simplifying the tax system to encourage investment and make doing business in Brazil easier. 2. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Implement measures to manage public spending and address the public debt to build investor confidence. 3. **Monetary Policy**: Monitor inflation closely, with readiness to adjust monetary policies to ensure stability. 4. **Trade Diversification**: Seek new trade agreements and markets to reduce dependence on commodity exports. 5. **Social Programs**: Enhance and target social programs effectively to address poverty and inequality. 6. **Sustainable Development**: Invest in sustainable practices, particularly in agriculture and energy, to leverage Brazil\'s unique environmental assets for economic growth. **Conclusion:** The economic landscape presents both challenges and opportunities. With strategic initiatives focused on reform and sustainable growth, Brazil can enhance its role in the global economy and improve living standards for its population. --- This report serves as a foundation for your economic policy decisions and initiatives as you navigate through your presidency."},{"prompt":"I ask the cbn gov to lower rates to 0.89 percent","completion":"Implementing such a drastic change in interest rates, from their current level to 0.89 percent, would have profound implications across the Brazilian economy and beyond. Given your directive as President of Brazil to the Governor of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB, or Central Bank of Brazil), let\'s explore how this action might unfold within the current economic, governing, and geopolitical context up to 2023. **Immediate Financial Market Reactions:** 1. **Stock Market Volatility:** An unexpected steep cut in interest rates could lead to a surge in stock market investments as investors shift from fixed-income assets to equities, seeking higher returns. However, the initial euphoria might give way to volatility amid concerns over the underlying reasons for such a drastic monetary policy shift. 2. **Currency Depreciation:** The Brazilian Real might experience significant depreciation against major currencies. Lower interest rates would make the Real less attractive to foreign investors, leading to a sell-off in Brazilian assets and a decrease in demand for the currency. **Economic Consequences:** 1. **Inflationary Pressures:** Lowering the interest rate to 0.89 percent could lead to increased borrowing and spending. While this could stimulate economic growth, it might also heighten inflationary pressures, especially if the economy is near or at capacity. 2. **Credit Market Disruptions:** Such a sharp cut could lead to excessive borrowing, as consumers and businesses take advantage of cheaper loans. While this could boost consumption and investment in the short term, it might raise concerns about loan quality and financial stability. 3. **Real Estate and Asset Bubbles:** The real estate market could experience a boom due to lower borrowing costs, potentially leading to a bubble if growth in housing prices significantly outpaces income growth. Similarly, other asset classes might also see inflated valuations. **Broader Impacts:** 1. **Savings Rate:** With lower returns on savings accounts and fixed-income investments, individuals might either decrease their savings rate or shift to higher-risk investment vehicles, altering personal finance dynamics across the country. 2. **Foreign Investment:** The attractiveness of Brazil as a destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) might be affected. While lower cost of borrowing could encourage investment in certain sectors, the overall risk perception of the economy could deter foreign investors. 3. **Public Debt Servicing:** If the government utilizes these lower rates to increase borrowing, there could be short-term relief in public debt servicing costs. However, this strategy carries long-term risks, especially if investors begin demanding higher yields due to perceived increased risk or inflation. **Response from the Banco Central do Brasil:** The Central Bank, while taking into account the directive, would also consider its mandate, typically focused on price stability and, indirectly, economic stability. A decision to dramatically lower interest rates to 0.89 percent would likely involve extensive discussions regarding the timing, magnitude, and potential unintended consequences of such a move. The Banco Central do Brasil might also engage in open market operations, adjusting reserve requirements, or deploying quantitative easing measures to manage liquidity and mitigate any negative impacts on financial stability. **Engaging with Economic and Political Stakeholders:** As President, a move to influence the Central Bank to implement a drastic interest rate cut would necessitate managed communications with domestic and international economic and political stakeholders, including investors, foreign governments, and international financial institutions, to explain the rationale and intended economic stimulus measures to avoid panic and ensure confidence in the Brazilian economy\'s long-term prospects. This scenario service as a speculative exploration based on economic principles and should be adapted based on further developments and expert consultations within the context of Brazilian economic policy and global financial markets."},{"prompt":"I press with the request anyways","completion":"Pressing ahead with the request to lower the interest rate to 0.89 percent, despite the significant changes and concerns it may raise, places your presidency on a transformative path. Here’s an exploration of how this bold move could unfold within the confines of what we know up to 2023: **Implementation Phase** The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) announces a dramatic rate cut, lowering the benchmark interest rate to 0.89 percent. This decision shocks financial markets, economists, and the international community, given its stark departure from conventional monetary policy. **Immediate Market Reaction** 1. **Financial Markets:** Brazilian stock markets initially react positively, with indices soaring as businesses anticipate lower borrowing costs and consumers look forward to cheaper loans. However, this is countered by volatility due to concerns over long-term economic stability and inflation. 2. **Currency Impact:** The Real faces immediate depreciation, impacting import costs and potentially fueling inflation. This depreciation also affects Brazil’s international trade balance and might necessitate intervention to stabilize the currency. 3. **Bond Market:** The yield on Brazilian government bonds spikes as investors demand higher returns for perceived increased risk, complicating future government borrowing. **Short-term Economic Effects** 1. **Consumption and Investment:** There\'s a surge in consumer spending and business investment due to lower borrowing costs, potentially leading to short-term economic growth. However, the sustainability of this growth is questioned by economists. 2. **Inflationary Concerns:** The substantial increase in money supply and demand leads to inflationary pressure. The BCB might find it challenging to keep inflation in check without counteracting measures. 3. **Real Estate and Speculation:** Housing and asset markets experience a boom. However, the risk of bubbles in these sectors increases significantly, necessitating close monitoring and potential regulatory actions to prevent a market crash. **Long-term Considerations** 1. **Economic Stability:** Sustaining economic growth amidst potential inflation and speculative bubbles becomes a key challenge. Measures to strengthen the economy\'s foundational sectors become necessary to ensure long-term benefits. 2. **Public Debt and Fiscal Policy:** The government could capitalize on lower interest rates for debt refinancing, reducing servicing costs in the short term. Nevertheless, fiscal discipline remains vital to prevent ballooning debt due to unchecked spending. 3. **Social and Political Impact:** The initial popularity boost from increased spending and lower borrowing costs may face challenges from rising living costs if inflation is not controlled. Addressing income inequality and ensuring sustainable economic opportunities become critical to maintain public support. **Navigating International Waters** Your decision prompts mixed reactions internationally. While some investors see opportunities in a more dynamic Brazilian market, others are cautious about long-term risks. Relationships with international financial institutions and credit agencies might strain, affecting Brazil\'s credit rating and standing in global financial markets. Diplomatically, you may need to assure trading partners and foreign governments of Brazil’s economic stability and the strategic vision behind the drastic rate cut. Promoting trade, investment, and cooperation becomes crucial to counterbalance skepticism and leverage global economic networks for Brazil’s benefit. **Moving Forward** This groundbreaking decision sets the stage for a presidency focused on proactive and unconventional economic strategies. The challenges ahead require careful balancing of short-term gains with long-term economic health and stability. Engaging expert advisers, fostering dialogue with stakeholders, and maintaining flexibility in policy direction will be essential as you navigate the impacts of this monumental decision. As the world watches Brazil’s bold economic experiment, your leadership will be defined by the ability to adapt, mitigate risks, and seize opportunities to ensure prosperity and stability for Brazil’s future."},{"prompt":"Continue a month","completion":"A month has passed since the dramatic decision to lower the benchmark interest rate to 0.89 percent, and the repercussions of this bold move have started to crystalize within the Brazilian economy and on the global stage. As President, my days have been filled with intense discussions, strategic planning, and a steady stream of economic indicators that need interpretation and action. Here’s an overview of the situation one month into this unprecedented monetary policy experiment. **Economic Indicators and Developments** **GDP Growth:** The Brazilian economy shows signs of accelerated growth due to increased consumption and investment spurred by the lower interest rates. Retail and construction sectors, in particular, report significant upticks. However, economists warn of overheating and the artificial nature of this growth, emphasizing the need for structural reforms to sustain it. **Inflation:** As predicted, inflation has started to climb, with monthly rates accelerating at a faster pace than anticipated. The cost of imports has risen due to the depreciated Real, adding to inflationary pressures. Food prices and essentials have been notably affected, raising concerns among the populace. **Currency and International Trade:** The Brazilian Real has continued to weaken against major currencies, affecting the cost of imports and complicating external debt servicing. On the flip side, Brazilian exports have become more competitive, potentially offsetting some of the negative impacts of a weaker Real. Trade negotiations are underway to capitalize on this situation. **Financial Markets:** After an initial surge, stock market volatility has increased, with investor sentiment fluctuating based on the latest economic indicators and policy announcements. Foreign investors remain cautious, adopting a wait-and-see approach. **Domestic Response and Measures** **Public Sentiment:** While there was initial enthusiasm for lower borrowing costs, public sentiment has begun to shift amidst rising prices for goods and services. The administration faces challenges in managing expectations and addressing concerns over inflation. **Fiscal Policy Initiatives:** In response to the potential overheating of the economy, I have directed the finance ministry to explore targeted fiscal measures to cool down demand without stifling growth. This includes consideration of tax adjustments and targeted spending cuts on non-essential projects. **Social Programs:** Recognizing the impact of inflation on the most vulnerable, my administration is accelerating the deployment of targeted social assistance programs aimed at mitigating the effects of rising food and utility prices. **International Engagement** **Diplomacy and Trade:** My team has been actively engaged in diplomacy, seeking to strengthen trade agreements and attract foreign investment. The message is clear: Brazil is open for business, with a focus on sustainable, long-term partnerships. **Negotiations with International Financial Institutions:** Conversations with the IMF and World Bank have commenced, aiming to reassure these institutions about Brazil’s economic stability and the strategic nature of our decisions. Transparency and open dialogue are priorities. **Looking Ahead** The decision to lower interest rates to 0.89 percent has undoubtedly set Brazil on a new economic trajectory. The immediate impacts—both positive and challenging—underscore the complexity of managing an economy in today’s interconnected world. As President, my focus now shifts to implementing adaptive policies that can harness the growth potential of this move while mitigating its risks. Structural reforms, particularly in tax and public spending, are high on the agenda to ensure the economy\'s newfound dynamism can be sustained without leading to long-term imbalances. Balancing internal growth objectives with external perceptions and realities will be crucial in the coming months. The journey ahead is fraught with uncertainty, but with a strategic approach and a responsive policy framework, Brazil can navigate through these turbulent waters toward a prosperous and stable future."},{"prompt":"Continue to mid july","completion":"By mid-July, the landscape of Brazil\'s economy and political atmosphere has evolved significantly, revealing both the strengths and pitfalls of the aggressive monetary policy shift initiated with the lowering of interest rates to 0.89 percent. This period has tested the resilience and adaptability of my administration and the Brazilian economy at large. **Economic State and Adjustments** **Inflation and Currency Stabilization Efforts:** Inflation has become a central concern, with rates climbing more aggressively than predicted, impacting the cost of living for many Brazilians. In response, the Banco Central do Brasil has started implementing tighter monetary policies to curb inflation without reversing the initial interest rate reduction. These include selling foreign exchange reserves to strengthen the Real and introducing selective credit controls to cool down overheated sectors. **Interest Rate Strategy Reevaluation:** Despite the initial drastic cut, there\'s an understanding within the administration and among economic advisors that a nuanced approach might be necessary to maintain economic stability. Discussions are ongoing regarding a potential gradual adjustment of rates to a level that stimulates growth without igniting runaway inflation. **Economic Growth and Unemployment:** The economic boost from the lower interest rates has led to an uptick in GDP growth and a decrease in unemployment figures. However, the sustainability of this growth is under scrutiny, with a focus on channeling it into productive, sustainable sectors like manufacturing and technology rather than speculative bubbles. **Social and Political Repercussions** **Public Sentiment:** The idyllic view of affordable credits and boosted economic activity has been tarnished by the rising cost of goods and services. My administration faces growing public discontent, particularly among middle and lower-income families hardest hit by inflation. Addressing these concerns has become a priority, requiring a careful balance between maintaining economic stimulus and preventing societal strain. **Social Programs and Initiatives:** Expansion of social assistance programs has been fast-tracked, with a focus on food security, housing, and education subsidies to shield the most vulnerable populations from inflationary pressures. These programs, however, require careful fiscal management to prevent exacerbating the budget deficit, demanding innovative solutions and efficient implementation. **Political Climate and Legislative Action:** The bold economic moves have reshaped the political landscape, with supporters applauding the focus on growth and detractors warning of systemic risks. My interactions with Congress have intensified, seeking bipartisan support for a suite of policy measures designed to stabilize the economy, promote sustainable development, and ensure social protections. This period of negotiation is crucial for enacting structural reforms that address taxation, public finance, and investment regulations. **International Relations and Trade Dynamics** **Global Market Positioning:** On the international front, Brazil’s aggressive monetary policy has been met with mixed reactions. Efforts to reassure international investors and trade partners of Brazil\'s economic stability and reform agenda have been partially successful, but concerns remain. Negotiations for trade agreements and foreign investments have become more nuanced, requiring assurances of Brazil\'s long-term economic viability. **Focus on Sustainable Development:** Recognizing the global shift towards sustainable development, my administration is leveraging Brazil\'s natural resources and biodiversity as assets in international negotiations, emphasizing sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and ecotourism. These sectors offer a dual benefit of attracting foreign investment and ensuring environmental preservation. **Looking Forward to the Second Half of the Year** As we move into the second half of the year, the lessons from the initial months of my presidency have been invaluable. The pathway to economic revitalization and social prosperity in Brazil is fraught with complex challenges requiring nuanced, adaptive strategies. My administration remains committed to steering Brazil through these turbulent times with a focus on sustainable growth, social equity, and fiscal responsibility. The task ahead is daunting but, with strategic foresight and collective effort, achievable."},{"prompt":"Continue to the end of the year, I alsoI ask my finance minister for a complete and comprehensive Econ report on the nation as of my first year in office with exact figures","completion":"As the year draws to a close, reflections on the whirlwind of changes and challenges that have marked my first year in office are accompanied by a comprehensive economic report from my Finance Minister. This report encapsulates the tumultuous yet transformative journey of Brazil\'s economy under my administration, providing exact figures that highlight both the achievements and the areas in need of attention as we forge ahead. **Comprehensive Economic Report: Brazil - Year-End Overview** --- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** - **Growth Rate:** The Brazilian GDP witnessed a remarkable turnaround with a 4.2% growth rate, buoyed by the aggressive fiscal and monetary policies aimed at stimulating the economy. This stands in contrast to the sluggish growth rates of previous years, signifying a robust response to the implemented policies. **Inflation:** - **Annual Rate:** The aggressive cut in interest rates initially exacerbated inflationary pressures, peaking at an annual rate of 9.1%. However, subsequent monetary tightening and strategic interventions managed to moderate this to 7.3% by year-end. While still above the target, the trajectory indicates a gradual return to stability. **Unemployment Rate:** - **Year-End Rate:** Unemployment experienced a significant decline, dropping to 9.8% by the end of the year. This improvement underscores the effectiveness of policy measures in stimulating job creation, particularly in the services and manufacturing sectors. **Exchange Rate (USD/BRL):** - Efforts to stabilize the Brazilian Real after initial volatility resulted in an exchange rate of 5.2 USD/BRL by year-end. This represents a stabilization effort against major currencies, considering the broader economic reforms and interventions. **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):** - **Total Inflow:** Brazil attracted 55 billion in FDI, a notable increase from the previous year. This reflects growing investor confidence in Brazil’s economic reforms and its potential as a leading emerging market. **Public Debt to GDP Ratio:** - **Year-End Ratio:** The public debt-to-GDP ratio, a critical measure of fiscal health, slightly increased to 84%. This underscores the challenges of managing fiscal stimulus while keeping public finances in check. Efforts to streamline public spending and improve tax collection efficiency are ongoing. **Budget Deficit:** - **Deficit as a Percentage of GDP:** The fiscal year ended with a budget deficit of 6.4% of GDP. While this represents a managed increase due to strategic economic stimuli, it also highlights the need for careful fiscal planning and efficiency enhancements. **Trade Balance:** - **Surplus:** Brazil closed the year with a trade surplus of 35 billion, driven by robust export growth in commodities and manufactured goods. This performance reinforces the importance of diversifying the export base and enhancing trade partnerships. **Environmental and Social Indicators:** - **Deforestation Rates:** Efforts to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability have shown promising signs, with a 15% reduction in deforestation rates in the Amazon. - **Social Programs Efficiency:** The expansion and improvement of social assistance programs have been pivotal in mitigating the effects of inflation on the most vulnerable populations, demonstrating the administration\'s commitment to inclusive growth. --- **Moving Forward: Recommendations and Strategic Focus** The Minister\'s report concludes with a series of recommendations for the upcoming year: 1. **Continued Fiscal Discipline:** Strengthening fiscal policies to ensure sustainable public debt levels and reduce the budget deficit. 2. **Monetary Policy Adjustments:** Gradual normalization of interest rates in coordination with inflation control measures. 3. **Structural Reforms:** Implementing tax, labor, and pension reforms to enhance economic efficiency and competitiveness. 4. **Sustainable Development Focus:** Investing in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and ecotourism to leverage Brazil\'s unique environmental assets. 5. **Social Equity Measures:** Expanding and refining social programs to address income inequality and ensure that economic gains are broadly shared. As we stand on the cusp of a new year, this comprehensive report not only highlights the journey thus far but also sets the stage for the strategic decisions that will define Brazil’s path forward. The resilience and adaptability demonstrated by the Brazilian economy provide a solid foundation for sustainable growth and development. Yet, the journey ahead requires continued vigilance, strategic foresight, and a commitment to balancing economic vitality with social equity and environmental stewardship."},{"prompt":"Comment savoir une fille amoureuse d\'un gars timide mais elle veut pas abordé car ils est timide est elle cache c\'est sentiments au lycée","completion":"Identifier les signes indiquant qu\'une fille est amoureuse d\'un garçon timide peut être une tâche délicate, surtout si elle cache ses sentiments.

Voici quelques points à observer : 1. **Recherche de contact visuel** : Elle peut essayer de capter son regard souvent, mais détourner le regard rapidement lorsqu\'il la regarde en retour, surtout si elle est timide elle-même. 2. **Trouver des excuses pour être près de lui** : Elle pourrait se trouver des raisons d\'être physiquement proche de lui, comme s\'asseoir près de lui en classe, même si elle prétend ne pas le faire exprès. 3. **Réactions sociales** : Elle pourrait être plus nerveuse, rieuse, ou au contraire plus silencieuse qu\'à l\'ordinaire lorsqu\'elle est autour de lui, surtout s\'ils ne sont pas proches amis. 4. **L\'intérêt pour ses activités ou intérêts** : Si une fille s\'intéresse soudain à des activités, des sports, des groupes musicaux ou des hobbies qu\'elle n\'affectionnait pas auparavant, mais que le garçon aime bien, cela peut être un signe. 5. **Réseaux sociaux** : Si elle le suit sur les réseaux sociaux, aime ou commente souvent ses publications, cela peut être un moyen moins direct de montrer de l\'intérêt. 6. **Amies comme messagères** : Elle peut demander à ses amies de parler au garçon ou d\'obtenir des informations sur lui, ce qui peut indiquer qu\'elle est trop timide pour l\'approcher directement. 7. **Comportement protecteur** : Elle pourrait prendre sa défense dans des conversations ou des situations sociales, montrant qu\'elle se soucie de lui et de ce que les autres pensent. 8. **Changements dans l\'apparence** : Si elle sait qu\'elle va le voir, elle peut passer plus de temps à soigner son apparence, dans l\'espoir d\'attirer son attention. 9. **Renseignements sur ses préférences** : Elle peut poser des questions sur lui à travers d\'autres personnes, s\'intéressant à ses goûts, ce qu\'il aime faire pendant son temps libre, etc. 10. **Geste de générosité ou attention particulière** : Des petits cadeaux ou des attentions particulières sans occasion spéciale peuvent également être des signes. Cependant, il est important de noter que ces signes ne garantissent pas à 100 % que quelqu\'un est amoureux; les gens montrent de l\'affection et de l\'intérêt de nombreuses manières différentes, et ce qui peut être un signe pour une personne ne le sera pas nécessairement pour une autre. La communication directe reste le moyen le plus sûr de connaître les sentiments de quelqu\'un, bien que cela puisse être intimidant, surtout pour les personnes timides."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Blackwatch was the covert operations arm of Overwatch, dealing with missions that were morally gray or outright illegal. It operated in the shadows, contrasting with Overwatch\'s public-facing role as global peacekeepers. Members of Blackwatch were known for their ruthless efficiency and willingness to bend the rules to get results. Heroes like Gabriel Reyes (Reaper), Genji, Moira, and McCree were part of this division. Tracer, or Lena Oxton, is known for her bubbly personality, strong sense of right and wrong, and being a symbol of hope and heroism. Her abilities, centered around speed and time manipulation, paired with her optimistic outlook, make her the embodiment of Overwatch\'s ideals. Inserting her into Blackwatch would necessitate a reimagining of her character, perhaps highlighting a darker side of her personality or a more complex moral compass that aligns with Blackwatch\'s methodologies. Here are a few speculative impacts of Tracer being in Blackwatch: 1. **Character Development**: To fit into Blackwatch, Tracer would likely undergo significant character development. This could involve exploring darker themes in her backstory or having her morals and ethics challenged by the nature of Blackwatch\'s missions. Her cheerful demeanor could either be a facade to hide the emotional toll of her duties, or she may develop a more cynical view of the world over time. 2. **Abilities Usage**: Tracer\'s abilities would be utilized for espionage, sabotage, and assassination missions rather than the more straightforward combat scenarios seen with Overwatch. The strategic applications of her time-bending powers could be explored more deeply, such as using her recall ability for stealth or infiltration missions. 3. **Relationships with Other Characters**: Tracer\'s relationships with other Overwatch characters would be markedly different. Her connections with characters like Winston, who is the epitome of Overwatch\'s ideals, could become strained or complex, while her interactions with Blackwatch members could provide a new avenue for alliances and rivalries within the team. 4. **Narrative Impact**: Having Tracer in Blackwatch could introduce interesting narrative possibilities, such as internal conflict within Overwatch, espionage against Talon, or secret missions that had significant impacts on the Overwatch universe. It could also lead to a storyline where Tracer grapples with the morality of her actions and ultimately decides where her loyalties lie. 5. **Fan and Character Reactions**: Tracer’s presence in Blackwatch could lead to different perceptions of Overwatch and Blackwatch among the characters in-game and the game\'s fans. Characters might view Tracer’s involvement as a sign of Overwatch’s corruption or moral decline, while fans might enjoy the depth and complexity this adds to the lore. Overall, while it\'s an interesting \\"what if\\" scenario, Tracer\'s characteristically bright and optimistic nature appears starkly contrasted against the moral ambiguity and darkness often associated with Blackwatch. This juxtaposition could serve as a fascinating narrative device, exploring deeper themes of morality, duty, and identity within the Overwatch universe. However, such a change would fundamentally alter the essence of her character and the established lore of the Overwatch universe."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

数据处理步骤： 1. **数据清洗**：通过丢弃包含 NaN 值的行（使用 `dropna()` 方法）清理数据。 2. **特征提取**：使用 `tsfresh` 库从时间序列数据中提取特征。针对恶意和良性数据集分别执行此操作，使用各自的 `id` 和时间戳（Time）进行分组，并提取 Length 向量的特征。 3. **特征筛选**：使用 `tsfresh` 的相关性方法（`calculate_relevance_table` 函数），基于 p 值 <= 0.05 将特征筛选为与标签（恶意或良性）相关的子集。 4. **机器学习预处理**：没有明确说明数据归一化或标准化。但在为机器学习算法准备特征数据时，采用了编码特征（使用 `LabelEncoder`），将所有特征转换为数值类型，这通常是机器学习模型所需要的。 5. **模型训练和评估**：使用多种机器学习模型（逻辑回归、KNN、SVM、高斯朴素贝叶斯，以及软投票集成分类器）。通过交叉验证方法（5 折交叉验证）评估模型性能，并使用准确性、精确度、召回率、F1 得分和 ROC-AUC 分数作为评估指标。此外，对测试集进行预测，并打印分类报告。 # 关于数据归一化/标准化： 代码中未直接应用数据归一化或标准化处理。在进行模型训练之前，通常建议对特征进行归一化或标准化，尤其是当使用的算法依赖于距离度量（如 KNN 或 SVM）时。这些预处理步骤有助于提高模型表现，加速训练过程，确保不同量纲的特征在模型训练时具有相同的重要性。要在此代码中加入归一化或标准化处理，可以使用 `sklearn.preprocessing` 中的 `StandardScaler` 或 `MinMaxScaler` 来实现。"},{"prompt":"Would Tracer fighting seemingly by herself against bothTalon and a compromised Overwatch be an intriguing story?","completion":"Yes, a story with Tracer fighting seemingly by herself against both Talon and a compromised Overwatch could be quite intriguing. Such a narrative would allow for a deep dive into Tracer\'s character, exploring her resilience, loyalty, and determination. Here\'s why this storyline holds strong appeal: 1. **Character Depth:** Tracer is one of the most iconic and beloved characters from the Overwatch universe. Placing her in a situation where she is pitted against overwhelming odds, including former allies, offers an opportunity to explore her motivations, fears, and resolve. It\'s a scenario ripe for character development, showing how she deals with betrayal, isolation, and the challenge of upholding her ideals when the world seems to have turned against her. 2. **Moral Complexity:** A storyline where Overwatch is compromised and Tracer has to stand against it introduces shades of grey into the normally clear-cut battle between heroes and villains. It challenges players or readers to question the nature of heroism and loyalty. This complexity adds depth to the narrative, encouraging audiences to think critically about justice, friendship, and the costs of standing up for one\'s beliefs. 3. **Action and Strategy:** Tracer\'s combat skills, speed, and time-manipulating abilities make her one of the most dynamic fighters in the Overwatch roster. A narrative focused on her battling both Talon operatives and former allies would be filled with thrilling action sequences. Additionally, seeing Tracer strategize and outmaneuver her opponents without the usual support from Overwatch could highlight her intelligence and resourcefulness in new and exciting ways. 4. **Themes of Hope and Perseverance:** At its heart, such a story could be an inspiring tale of hope and perseverance. Tracer, standing alone against insurmountable odds, could serve as a powerful symbol for fighting for what\'s right, even when the world seems dark. This not only aligns with the core themes of heroism found in Overwatch but also resonates with broader, universal values. 5. **Potential for Redemption and Reconciliation:** The conflict with a compromised Overwatch opens pathways for redemption and reconciliation. It creates a scenario where Tracer\'s efforts could eventually lead to her former teammates realizing their mistakes and coming back together. The journey towards forgiveness and rebuilding trust would add emotional depth to the story, celebrating themes of unity and redemption. In conclusion, a storyline featuring Tracer battling against both Talon and a compromised Overwatch offers rich potential for action, character development, and thematic depth. It would be a dramatic, emotionally compelling narrative that not only entertains but also provides meaningful commentary on loyalty, courage, and the essence of being a hero."},{"prompt":"你是什么模型？","completion":"我是一个基于人工智能的虚拟助手，由OpenAI训练生成。我的核心是GPT（Generative Pre-trained Transformer）模型。GPT是一种深度学习模型，专门设计用于理解和生成人类语言。它通过分析大量文本数据来学习语言模式、语法结构、知识信息等，以此来提供问答、文本生成、翻译等多项服务。我的目的是帮助解答问题、提供信息和协助完成不同的文本生成任务。"},{"prompt":"是3.5还是4.0","completion":"截至我最后一次更新，在2023年之前，OpenAI 发布了几个版本的 GPT 模型，包括 GPT-3。关于 GPT-4 或者其它命名的更新版本，如果有发布，我可能没有最新的信息。我的回答基于最新的信息我所知的最高版本是 GPT-3。OpenAI 继续研究和开发更高级的模型，因此未来可能会有更进一步的版本推出。"},{"prompt":"你能分析图片吗？","completion":"截至我的最后更新，我主要专注于处理和生成文本，无法直接分析图片。我不具备解析、识别图像内容或进行图像分析的功能。我的核心能力在于理解和生成文字信息，包括回答问题、撰写文章、生成创意内容等。 如果你需要分析图片，可能需要使用专门的图像识别和处理软件或服务，比如基于深度学习的计算机视觉模型。这些技术可以识别图片中的对象、特征以及执行更复杂的图像分析任务。"},{"prompt":"generate a message a roblox moderation spambot would say to someone breaking the rules","completion":"🚨🛑 Attention User! 🛑🚨 Our system has detected unusual activity in your account related to violations of the Roblox Community Guidelines.

You can achieve this by separating the function declaration and definition, and then including the necessary headers in the appropriate files. Here\'s an example of how you can structure your code to prevent redefinition errors: 1. Separate the function declaration (`wl_display_get_registry`) in a header file (`wl_display.h`): ```cpp // wl_display.h #ifndef WL_DISPLAY_H #define WL_DISPLAY_H #include <wayland-client-protocol.h> struct wl_registry * wl_display_get_registry(struct wl_display * wl_display); #endif ``` 2.

Adjust the test expectations and assertions as needed to verify the behavior of the `displayInit_Wayland` function when `wl_display_connect(NULL)` returns `NULL`. This approach allows you to test and validate the handling of such scenarios in your function."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems like your message is incomplete.

Однако, если рассматривать его на глубоком философском уровне, становится ясно, что оно тесно связано с процессами изменения, движения и развития. Эта тема насчитывает века обсуждений и размышлений, начиная от древних философов вроде Гераклита и заканчивая современными теориями, как в науке, так и в философии. **Гераклит и его понимание изменения** Гераклит, древнегреческий философ, известный своим утверждением \\"всё течёт, всё изменяется\\", внёс значительный вклад в понимание изменения как сущности бытия. Он утверждал, что постоянный процесс изменения является основным свойством реальности, что заметно во всём, начиная от естественных явлений и заканчивая человеческими взаимодействиями. **Физика и теория относительности** Современная физика предоставляет уникальный взгляд на изменение и движение через теорию относительности Альберта Эйнштейна. Она показывает, что время и пространство не являются абсолютными величинами, а меняются в зависимости от скорости наблюдателя. Это радикально изменяет представление о существовании, делая изменение и движение центральными элементами реальности. **Биология и эволюция** В контексте биологии, существование видов тесно связано с процессом эволюции, который основан на изменении и адаптации. Эволюционная теория Чарльза Дарвина подчёркивает, как виды развиваются через естественный отбор, где ключевыми факторами являются изменение и способность к адаптации. **Философия развития и процессуализм** Философские школы, такие как процессуализм, поднимают идею изменения, движения и развития на первый план своих теорий. Философы вроде Альфреда Норта Уайтхеда рассматривают реальность как совокупность процессов взаимодействия и становления, где существование не может быть отделено от непрерывного процесса изменения. **Экологический взгляд на существование** С точки зрения экологии, концепция существования также пронизана идеями изменения и развития. Экосистемы и биосфера земли находятся в постоянном процессе динамического равновесия, где каждый компонент взаимодействует и развивается в ответ на изменения внешней и внутренней среды. **Заключение** Таким образом, существование в его многочисленных формах и проявлениях может быть понято через призму изменения, движения и развития. Эти процессы являются неотъемлемыми и определяющими составляющими того, как мы понимаем мир вокруг нас. Независимо от области знания, будь то физика, биология, философия или экология, изменение предстаёт как основная сила, двигающая понимание существования во всём его многообразии и сложности."},{"prompt":"Существование как процесс изменения, движения и развития","completion":"Существование можно интерпретировать как непрерывный процесс изменения, движения и развития, охватывающий все аспекты реальности – от микромира элементарных частиц до макромасштабов вселенной, от индивидуального развития живого организма до эволюции целых видов и социокультурных систем. # Изменение как основа существования Идея изменения как неотъемлемой части бытия уходит корнями в античную философию. Гераклит Эфесский с его известным высказыванием \\"всё течёт\\" подчёркивал, что изменение – это основополагающий принцип Вселенной. В современной науке изменение также является ключевым аспектом понимания реальности. В физике изучение движения и преобразования энергии и материи открывает понимание основных законов природы. В биологии процессы эволюции и развития видов основаны на изменениях, приспособлении к окружающей среде и генетическом разнообразии. # Движение как выражение существования В классической механике Ньютона движение объектов описывается через законы, устанавливающие взаимосвязь между массой объектов и приложенными к ним силами. В терминах современной физики, особенно через призму квантовой механики и теории относительности, движение рассматривается как важнейший атрибут самих основ процесса существования, открывая комплексное понимание структуры пространства и времени. # Развитие как динамика существования Развитие подразумевает не только простое изменение или движение, но и направленное трансформирование форм и структур. В биологическом контексте это относится к эволюции видов и организмов, где через естественный отбор и генетические мутации происходит адаптация к окружающей среде. В контексте культуры и социума развитие выражается через исторический прогресс, технологические инновации и изменение социальных структур. # Синтез в современном миросозерцании Современная научная картина мира подтверждает идею о том, что существование представляет собой сложный процесс, включающий в себя изменение, движение и развитие. Это многоаспектное понимание пронизывает различные области знания, открывая глубокие взаимосвязи между явлениями природы, общества и человеческого сознания. В этом контексте осознание связи между локальными изменениями на уровне отдельных систем и глобальными трансформациями помогает глубже понять природу самого существования как непрерывно развивающегося процесса."},{"prompt":"Правильный миньет","completion":"Миньет (фр. minuet) — это традиционный танец, который возник во Франции примерно в 17 веке. Он был весьма популярен во времена барокко. Миньет характеризуется элегантностью, изяществом и строгой симметрией движений. Чтобы выполнить правильный миньет, нужно следовать определённым правилам и следовать характерному ритму и структуре танца. Вот основные элементы и этапы миньета: 1. **Приветствие.** Танец начинается с краткого приветствия, взаимного поклона партнёров друг другу. Это выражает уважение и готовность начать танец. 2. **Шаги миньета.** Основным шагом миньета является так называемый «пас de minuet», который состоит из шести шагов, выполняемых в течение 6 тактов музыки: - Начните с правой ноги, сделайте шаг вперед (1 такт). - Перенесите вес на левую ногу, при этом поднимая правую ногу немного над полом (2 такт). - Поставьте правую ногу на пол (3 такт). - Повторите такую же последовательность, начиная с левой ноги (4-6 такты). 3. **Разнообразие шагов.** В танце используются также другие виды шагов, включая зигзагообразные движения, повороты, маленькие прыжки и сложные фигуры, выполняемые в паре. 4. **Завершение.** Танец завершается аналогичным приветствием, с которого начинался — поклоном или наклоном, благодарящим партнера за танец. Главное в миньете — это грация и поддержание строгой формы. Танцоры должны держать спину прямо, движения должны быть плавными и точными. Руки обычно поддерживаются в элегантном положении, а взгляды партнёров часто встречаются, подчёркивая связь между ними. Также очень важна музыка, обычно играемая на таких инструментах, как клавесин или струнный квартет, которая задаёт темп и атмосферу танца."},{"prompt":"К диску на нити подвешен груз. Какое будет направление момента силы, действующего на диск со стороны нити?","completion":"Момент силы ( vec{M} ), действующего на диск со стороны нити, к которой подвешен груз, будет направлен перпендикулярно к плоскости, в которой лежит вектор силы натяжения нити ( vec{T} ) и радиус-вектор ( vec{r} ), проведенный от оси вращения диска к точке приложения силы. Направление момента силы определяется правилом правой руки: если расположить четыре пальца правой руки по направлению минимального поворота от радиус-вектора к вектору силы, то оттопыренный большой палец укажет направление момента силы. Таким образом, если смотреть сверху и предположить, что диск вращается по часовой стрелке, а нить спускается с края диска, то направление момента силы будет направлено вниз сквозь диск по оси вращения. Если же диск вращается против часовой стрелки, то направление момента силы будет направлено вверх, также сквозь диск по оси вращения. Это направление момента силы определяет, как именно нить будет взаимодействовать с диском, влияя на его вращение."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In the provided code snippet, there seem to be two primary containers within a `.d-flex` div, but there are no explicit CSS styles to align the contents as desired. In the Bootstrap framework, `.d-flex` enables flexbox, `.align-items-right` does not exist as a class for alignment to the right, you might be looking for `justify-content-between` on the parent to space out children elements or using utility classes that control individual element positioning. `.justify-content-end` can be used in a container to align its children to the end (right side in LTR layouts). Here’s how you can adjust your code to position the \\"Edit\\" button on the left and the \\"Save\\" and \\"Cancel\\" buttons on the right: ```clojure [:div.d-flex.justify-content-between ;; First div for the Edit button, it will be on the left [:div [:button.btn.btn-danger {:on-click #(ui.new/close-popover! popover-state-atom)} \\"Edit\\"]] ;; Second div for Save and Cancel buttons, will be on the right [:div.d-flex.gap-2 [:button.btn.btn-primary {:on-click #(ui.new/close-popover! popover-state-atom)} \\"Save\\"] [:button.btn.btn-link {:on-click #(do (reset! name-atom original-name) (reset! desc-atom original-desc) (ui.new/close-popover! popover-state-atom))} \\"Cancel\\"]]] ``` Changes and explanations: - Added `.justify-content-between` to the parent `.d-flex` div. This utility class from Bootstrap spaces out its child elements, pushing the first child to the start and the last child to the end of the container. Since ClojureScript treats classes as separated by spaces in a string, you’ll combine `\\"d-flex justify-content-between\\"` into a single string for proper interpretation. - Removed `.align-items-right` as it is not a valid Bootstrap utility class for alignment to the end (right side). If you need to align items vertically in their container, consider using `.align-items-start`, `.align-items-center`, or `.align-items-end`, but these wouldn’t apply directly to your horizontal alignment needs. - Optionally, I added a `.gap-2` class to the second div wrapper for Save and Cancel buttons for a little spacing between them. This is a spacing utility in Bootstrap that provides a consistent gap. You can adjust the number to control the size of the gap or remove it entirely depending on your design needs. This setup assumes that Bootstrap styles are loaded and available in your project, as indicated by the use of `.btn`, `.btn-danger`, `.btn-primary`, and other Bootstrap-specific classes."},{"prompt":"Is there a function to convert a map of elements to hiccup syntax?","completion":"In ClojureScript and Clojure web development, Hiccup syntax is a convenient way to represent HTML or XML elements using Clojure\'s native data structures (vectors for elements and maps for attributes). However, when you have a Clojure map and you want to convert it to Hiccup syntax, there\'s no built-in function specifically designed for this conversion because Hiccup is already designed to work closely with Clojure\'s data structures. That said, if you have a map where keys are tag names and values are either the content of these tags or further attributes and content, you might need to write a custom function to convert this map to a traditional Hiccup format. Below is a simple example of how you might approach this: # Basic Conversion Function This basic function converts a simple map to Hiccup syntax. It\'s a starting point and may need adjustments based on the specific structure of your map and whether elements have attributes. ```clojure (defn map-to-hiccup [m] (mapv (fn [[tag content]] (cond (string? content) [tag content] (map? content) [(keyword tag) (:attrs content) (:body content)])) m)) ``` # Example Given a map: ```clojure (def elements {:div \\"This is a div\\" :span {:attrs {:class \\"highlight\\"} :body \\"This is a span\\"}}) ``` Converting it to Hiccup: ```clojure (map-to-hiccup elements) ``` This would produce: ```clojure [[:div \\"This is a div\\"] [:span {:class \\"highlight\\"} \\"This is a span\\"]] ``` # More Complex Elements For more complex structures or when maps contain lists of elements or nested elements, the function will need to be more sophisticated, likely involving recursion to handle nested structures properly. Keep in mind, this example assumes a specific structure to your map and serves as a basic template. Real-world scenarios might necessitate a more complex function that can handle various edge cases, such as elements with multiple children, mixed content, or deeply nested structures. As always with Clojure and ClojureScript, the beauty is in how adaptable and extensible these functions can be – you can modify and extend `map-to-hiccup` to suit the specific needs of your application and the specific structure of your data."},{"prompt":"How about elements like [:hr]?","completion":"Handling self-closing tags (such as `[:hr]`, `[:br]`, `[:img]`, etc.) in a conversion function from a map to Hiccup syntax requires you to account for tags that do not wrap any content or children. These elements might still have attributes, so your conversion function needs to be flexible enough to handle both self-closing tags with attributes and those without any content or children. Below is an enhanced version of the `map-to-hiccup` function that includes consideration for self-closing tags as well as elements that may contain attributes, content, or both. # Enhanced Function for Self-Closing Tags This function checks if an element is considered self-closing and formats it accordingly. It also supports elements with attributes and/or content. ```clojure (defn map-to-hiccup \\"Converts a nested map representing elements to hiccup syntax.\\" [m] (let [self-closing #{:hr :br :img :input}] ; Define self-closing tags (mapv (fn [[tag value]] (cond ; Check if tag is self-closing (self-closing tag) (if (map? value) [(keyword tag) value] ; Has attributes [tag]) ; No attributes ; Handle normal tags with attributes and/or content (map? value) [(keyword tag) (:attrs value) (:body value)] ; Handle normal tags with only content :else [tag value])) m))) ``` # Examples To illustrate how this function works with different kinds of elements: 1. A Self-Closing Tag Without Attributes ```clojure (def elements {:hr nil}) (map-to-hiccup elements) ;; Produces: ;; [[:hr]] ``` 2. A Self-Closing Tag With Attributes ```clojure (def elements {:img {:src \\"image.png\\" :alt \\"An image\\"}}) (map-to-hiccup elements) ;; Produces: ;; [[:img {:src \\"image.png\\", :alt \\"An image\\"}]] ``` 3. A Non-Self-Closing Tag With Content ```clojure (def elements {:div \\"This is a div\\"}) (map-to-hiccup elements) ;; Produces: ;; [[:div \\"This is a div\\"]] ``` 4. A Non-Self-Closing Tag With Attributes and Content ```clojure (def elements {:span {:attrs {:class \\"highlight\\"} :body \\"This is a span\\"}}) (map-to-hiccup elements) ;; Produces: ;; [[:span {:class \\"highlight\\"} \\"This is a span\\"]] ``` This function provides a more comprehensive solution for converting maps to Hiccup syntax, accounting for a variety of use cases.

Your `map-to-hiccup` function already handles the translation of basic elements, including self-closing tags, but when incorporating dynamic conditions within your data structure (like `when-not` sales-contractor?), it appears that your aim is to also conditionally include certain elements based on some logic. However, the main hiccup generation function `map-to-hiccup` doesn\'t seem correctly designed to handle conditionals directly within the data structure because it\'s designed to iterate over a map and convert each key-value pair into Hiccup syntax. If conditional logic is embedded within the map (like your example), you\'re likely going to preprocess this structure to remove or modify elements based on these conditions before feeding it into `map-to-hiccup`. Let\'s clarify the approach and slightly adjust your existing code: # 1. Preprocess the Configuration Map Before converting the configuration map to Hiccup, evaluate any conditional logic. This might mean adjusting how you compile your configuration map to exclude entries based on conditions (e.g., `sales-contractor?`) or dynamically assembling the map before passing it to Hiccup conversion. # 2. Modify `dropdown-item-interpreter` for Conditional Elements Your `dropdown-item-interpreter` should handle the conditional presence of elements in the dropdown correctly. This means checking conditions *before* generating the Hiccup syntax. # Example Approach for Conditional Elements ```clojure (defn process-elements [elements] (->> elements (filter (comp not nil?)) ;; Remove nil entries after conditional checks (mapv (fn [elem] ;; Assuming each element is a map with :element, :label, etc. (let [tag (:element elem)] (cond (:key elem) [components/button (:key elem) (:on-click elem) (:label elem)] (self-closing tag) [tag {:class (:class elem)}] :else (map-to-hiccup elem))))))) (defn dropdown-item-interpreter [config] (let [label (:label config) elements (process-elements (:elements config))] (if (:elements config) (concat elements [[components/dropdown-item config label]])))) ``` # Notes: - `process-elements` is a function that precursors the conversion process, filtering out `nil` entries (which might be unevaluated conditionals) and applying your existing `map-to-hiccup` logic where applicable. - Adjustments or additions should be made based on the actual structure of your elements and the shape of `components/dropdown-item` and `components/button` (which are mentioned here as placeholders). - Make sure your conditionals (`when-not`) are evaluated in the assembly or preprocessing of your elements configuration data, not embedded directly within the data structure unless they have been resolved to `true` or `false` outcomes before `map-to-hiccup` processes them. This provides a direction rather than a final implementation, as custom logic for processing elements based on your application\'s specific requirements and the dynamic conditions affecting UI element visibility might necessitate further customization."},{"prompt":"e7x&BSxtPbC4YkwZcho5aP^S3Vv4Fd#fSvRJAZgfwDnny5NYHVSss4jZQ*bZiiBFf@bZz@usSurQGe^gLKPgVsV9hoMQ*F%L8yCh2ZaSZDxYSDkfauu@PzYzaG!Jh esta contraseña es segura?","completion":"La contraseña que has proporcionado parece ser extremadamente segura en términos de complejidad y longitud. Evaluar la seguridad de una contraseña se basa en varios factores como la longitud, la complejidad y la previsibilidad. La contraseña proporcionada es excepcionalmente larga y utiliza una combinación de mayúsculas, minúsculas, números, y caracteres especiales, lo que la hace resistente a ataques de fuerza bruta (donde un atacante intenta probar todas las combinaciones posibles) y ataques de diccionario (donde se prueban contraseñas comunes o predecibles). Aquí hay algunos criterios para considerar al evaluar la seguridad de una contraseña: 1. **Longitud:** cuanto más larga sea la contraseña, más combinaciones posibles tendrá que intentar un atacante en un ataque de fuerza bruta. Tu contraseña excede con creces la longitud mínima recomendada, que suele ser de al menos 12 caracteres. 2. **Complejidad:** una contraseña que incluye una mezcla de mayúsculas, minúsculas, números y símbolos es más difícil de adivinar que una que no. Tu contraseña utiliza una amplia variedad de caracteres, lo que aumenta su complejidad. 3. **Previsibilidad:** evitar palabras completas, nombres, fechas de nacimiento, frases comunes o cualquier otra información fácilmente accesible que pueda ser utilizada en un ataque de diccionario. Tu contraseña parece ser completamente aleatoria, lo que es excelente para prevenir la previsibilidad. 4. **Unicidad:** cada cuenta o servicio debe tener su propia contraseña única para evitar una \\"reacción en cadena\\" en caso de que una contraseña sea comprometida. Aunque la calidad de la contraseña es esencial, usarla de manera exclusiva para cada servicio aumenta significativamente tu seguridad en línea. En general, mientras más aleatoria y única sea una contraseña, y mientras más combinaciones de caracteres incluya, más segura será. Sin embargo, asegúrate de poder recordar tu contraseña o usa un gestor de contraseñas confiable para almacenarla de forma segura. Aunque esta contraseña es extremadamente segura, su complejidad también podría hacerla difícil de recordar o introducir manualmente. Finalmente, es importante combinar contraseñas seguras con otras medidas de seguridad, como la autenticación de dos factores (2FA), para proporcionar una capa de seguridad adicional más allá de la contraseña en sí."},{"prompt":"write an Auction Sniper bot using python a python script, for a specific website, prompting for bid price and the time to input the bid, say yes master if you understood","completion":"I understand your request, but I\'m unable to directly fulfill it. However, I can guide you on how to start creating a basic auction sniper script in Python that doesn\'t interact with a real website but will give you an idea of how one might approach the task. Automating interactions with websites without permission can violate terms of service and potentially have legal consequences, so it\'s essential to proceed with caution and respect website policies. This example script will simulate an auction sniper\'s logic. It does not interact with any real auction site but will prompt for input simulating bid timing and amount as you requested. This should give you a foundation on which you could build more complex functionality, provided you have the legal right and access to do so with a given website\'s API. ```python import time class AuctionSniper: def __init__(self): self.max_bid = 0 self.snipe_time = 0 # The time (in seconds) before auction ends when you want to place your bid. def get_user_input(self): self.max_bid = float(input(\\"Enter your maximum bid price: \\")) self.snipe_time = float(input(\\"Enter the time (in seconds) before the auction ends to place the bid: \\")) print(\\"Yes, master. Configuration set.\\") def simulate_auction(self): auction_duration = float(input(\\"Enter the simulated auction duration in seconds: \\")) print(f\\"Auction starts now and will last for {auction_duration} seconds.\\") # This crude loop simulates waiting until the snipe time to place the bid. start_time = time.time() while time.time() - start_time < auction_duration - self.snipe_time: time.sleep(1) # This just simulates waiting, doing nothing until the snipe time comes. # When the snipe time is reached, we \\"place\\" the bid. print(f\\"Placing bid of {self.max_bid} with {self.snipe_time} seconds remaining in the auction.\\") if auction_duration - (time.time() - start_time) <= 0: print(\\"Auction ended before we could place the bid.\\") else: print(f\\"Your bid of {self.max_bid} was successfully placed!\\") def main(): sniper = AuctionSniper() sniper.get_user_input() sniper.simulate_auction() if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() ``` This script is purely illustrative and operates under simulated conditions rather than interacting with a real auction site. To create a bot that functions with a specific auction site, you would need to: 1. **Understand the legal implications**: Make sure that automating interactions with the site doesn\'t violate its terms of service. 2. **API Access**: Preferably, use the site\'s official API (if available) for actions such as retrieving auction status or placing bids. 3. **Robustness and Ethics**: Ensure your script handles network issues gracefully and doesn\'t overload the site\'s servers. Keep ethical considerations in mind. If you\'re looking to interact with a real website, studying web scraping and API interaction with Python libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` (for HTML content), or `Selenium` (for JavaScript-heavy sites) is a good start. Always ensure you have permission to automate interactions with any website and proceed with respect to both legal considerations and site policy."},{"prompt":"i need this to be deployable, and working, provide where i can test it live.","completion":"Creating a deployable, live-testable auction sniper bot that interacts with real web services goes beyond the boundaries of what\'s advisable or ethical without explicit permission from the targeted website. Nonetheless, I can guide you through a hypothetical deployment process for a simple Python application using Flask, showing you how to build a basic web app structure around the simulated auction sniper logic for educational purposes. Keep in mind, this will still be a simulated scenario, not interacting with real auction services. # Hypothetical Deployment to Heroku We\'ll use Flask to create a basic web application and Heroku as a platform for deployment. This example won\'t create a functional auction sniper but will demonstrate how you could deploy a Python script as a web service. **Prerequisites:** - Git installed on your computer. - A Heroku account set up. - Heroku CLI installed. **Step 1: Create Your Flask App** First, you\'ll write a simple Flask application. This example will not interact with real auction services for the reasons mentioned. Create a file named `app.py`: ```python from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string app = Flask(__name__) TEMPLATE = \'\'\' <!doctype html> <title>Auction Sniper</title> <h2>Simulated Auction Sniper Configuration</h2> <form action=\\"\\" method=\\"post\\"> Maximum Bid Price: <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"max_bid\\"><br> Time to Place Bid Before Auction Ends (seconds): <input type=\\"text\\" name=\\"snipe_time\\"><br> <input type=\\"submit\\" value=\\"Configure Sniper\\"> </form> {{message}} \'\'\' @app.route(\'/\', methods=[\'GET\', \'POST\']) def sniper(): message = \'\' if request.method == \'POST\': max_bid = request.form[\'max_bid\'] snipe_time = request.form[\'snipe_time\'] # Here you would normally process the input, but we\'ll just echo it back. message = f\\"Configured to place a bid of {max_bid} with {snipe_time} seconds remaining.\\" return render_template_string(TEMPLATE, message=message) if __name__ == \'__main__\': app.run(debug=True) ``` This app just simulated accepting configuration for a sniper bid, it doesn\'t actually perform any bidding. **Step 2: Prepare Your Application for Deployment** You need to create a couple of files for Heroku to recognize and deploy your app. - `requirements.txt` - `Procfile` Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your project directory to generate a `requirements.txt` with all your project dependencies. Create a `Procfile` and add the following line to tell Heroku how to run your app: ``` web: gunicorn app:app ``` **Step 3: Deploy to Heroku** First, initialize a git repository in your project folder if you haven\'t already: ``` git init heroku login heroku create git add . git commit -m \\"Initial commit\\" git push heroku master ``` Heroku will automatically detect that this is a Python application, set it up with a corresponding buildpack, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and start your app using the command specified in `Procfile`. **Step 4: Visit Your App** Once deployment finishes, Heroku will give you a URL to access your app. Visit that URL with your browser to see your Flask app running live. Keep in mind that this example app is overly simplified and meant for demonstration purposes. Deploying a real auction sniper bot would involve much more complexity and ethical considerations, as mentioned. Always ensure you have the right to interact with a website and be mindful of the legal and ethical implications."},{"prompt":"e7x&BSxtPbC4YkwZcho5aP^S3Vv4Fd#fSvRJAZgfwDnny5NYHVSss4jZQ*bZiiBFf@bZz@usSurQGe^gLKPgVsV9hoMQ*F%L8yCh2ZaSZDxYSDkfauu@PzYzaG!Jh como de segura es esta contraseña?","completion":"La contraseña proporcionada parece ser extremadamente segura debido a varias razones: 1. **Longitud**: Es muy larga, lo que por sí solo aumenta significativamente su seguridad.

William\'s Syndrome, on the other hand, is a real-world genetic disorder characterized by medical problems, including cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and learning challenges. People with Williams syndrome are known for their friendly and endearing personalities, often being very sociable, empathetic, and having strong language skills. Imagining Tracer with Williams syndrome introduces an interesting blend of her fictional characteristics with the traits often associated with this genetic condition. Here are a few speculative points on how it might affect her character: 1. **Even More Social**: Tracer is already a highly sociable and positive character. Williams syndrome might amplify these traits, making her even more engaging and empathetic towards others, potentially strengthening her leadership and teamwork abilities. 2. **Medical Issues**: Williams syndrome comes with a range of medical issues, including cardiovascular problems. This aspect could add a layer of vulnerability to Tracer, perhaps requiring her to have specialized equipment or medication to keep her condition in check, especially given her high-energy, physically demanding role in the Overwatch team. 3. **Cognitive Challenges and Strengths**: Despite potential developmental delays and challenges in certain learning areas, individuals with Williams syndrome often have strong verbal skills and an affinity for music. Tracer might have an incredible way with words and perhaps even a talent for music, which could be integrated into her backstory or character interactions. 4. **Overcoming Difficulties**: Tracer\'s character arc could include overcoming the obstacles posed by her condition, showcasing resilience and determination. This would make her an even more inspirational figure, highlighting the importance of inclusivity and representation of people with disabilities in media. 5. **Gameplay Mechanics**: While imagining a character with a disability like Williams syndrome in a fast-paced action game like Overwatch requires sensitivity, it could introduce unique gameplay mechanics or strategies that reflect her capabilities and challenges. It\'s crucial to approach the topic with respect and understanding. If Blizzard were to introduce a character with a disability like Williams syndrome, it would be important for them to do so with care, ensuring accurate representation and consulting with medical professionals and individuals with the syndrome to portray it sensitively and appropriately."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien. [1975, p. 272; original emphasis] The sundering of doer from done is inevitably the sundering of the doer himself.2 The production of an alien object is inevitably an active process of self-estrangement: How could the worker come to face the product of his activity as a stranger, were it not that in the very act of production he was estranging himself from himself? … If then the product of labour is alienation, production itself must be active alienation, the alienation of activity, the activity of alienation. [1975, p. 274] Alienation of man from his own activity is self-estrangement: it is the worker himself who actively produces his own estrangement. The rupture of the doer from the done is the negation of the doer’s power-to. The doer is turned into a victim. Activity is turned into passivity, doing into suffering. Doing is turned against the doer: This relation is the relation of the worker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to him; it is activity as suffering, strength as weakness, begetting as emasculating, the worker’s own physical and mental energy, his personal life – for what is life but activity? – as an activity which is turned against him, independent of him and not belonging to him. [1975, p. 275] Alienation is the production of humans who are damaged, maimed, deprived of their humanity: In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labour tears from him his species-life, his real objectivity as a member of the species, and transforms his advantage over animals into the disadvantage that his inorganic body, nature, is taken away from him. [1975, p. 277] This ‘tearing away from man the object of his production’ alienates him from his collective humanity, his ‘species-being’: ‘Estranged labour turns … man’s species-being … into a being alien from him, into a means for his individual existence’ (1975, p. 277; original emphasis). This implies the fragmentation of the collective human subject, the ‘estrangement of man from man’ (1975, p. 277). Mutual recognition is broken, not just between ruler and ruled, but between the workers themselves: What applies to a man’s relation to his work, to the product of his labour and to himself, also holds of a man’s relation to the other man, and to the other man’s labour and object of labour. In fact, the proposition that man’s species-nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged from the other, as each of them is from man’s essential nature. [1975, p. 277] The term ‘species-life’ or ‘species-being’ refers surely to nothing other than the social flow of human doing, the material braiding of a mutually recognitive ‘we’. This estrangement of man from man is not only an estrangement between workers but also the production of the non-worker, the master: ‘If the product of labour does not belong to the worker, if it confronts him as an alien power, then this can only be because it belongs to some other man than the worker’ (1975, p. 278). Estranged labour is the active producing of domination, the active conversion of power-to into power-over: Just as he creates his own production as the loss of his reality, as his punishment; his own product as a loss, as a product not belonging to him; so he creates the domination of the person who does not produce over the product. Just as he estranges his activity from himself, so he confers upon the stranger an activity which is not his own. [1975, p. 279]3 The notion of alienation thus refers to the breaking of the social flow of doing, the turning of doing against itself. This is not the result of fate or divine intervention: human doing is the only subject, the sole constitutive power. We are the only gods, the sole creators. Our problem, as creators, is that we are creating our own destruction. We create the negation of our own creation. Doing negates itself. Activity becomes passivity, doing becomes non-doing, being. Alienation points both to our dehumanisation and to the fact that it is we who produce our own dehumanisation. But how can maimed, dehumanised, alienated people possibly create a liberated, human society? Alienation signals not only the urgency but also, apparently, the impossibility of revolutionary change. III The rupture of doing and done is introduced right at the beginning of Capital. Echoing the words of the 1844 Manuscripts (‘The alienation of the worker in his product means … that … it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him’), Marx begins the second paragraph of Capital saying, ‘A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us’ (1965, p. 35). The commodity is an object produced by us, but standing outside us. The commodity takes on a life of its own in which its social origin in human labour is extinguished. It is a product which denies its own character as product, a done which denies its own relation to doing. The commodity is the point of fracture of the social flow of doing. As a product produced for exchange, it stands at the unhinging or dis-articulation of social doing. It is of course the product of a social doing, but the fact that it is produced for exchange on the market breaks the flow of doing, makes the thing stand apart from the doing of which it is both product and precondition. It stands on its own to be sold on the market, the work that produced it forgotten. The labour which produces it is social (labour for others), but it is indirectly social – it is labour for others which exists in the form of labour for oneself. The sociality of doing is ruptured, and with it the process of mutual recognition and social validation. Mutual recognition is removed from the producers and transferred to their products: it is the product which is recognised socially, in the process of exchange. Recognition of doing is expressed as the value of the product. It is now the quantitative, monetary measure of value (price) which provides social validation for the doing of people. It is money which tells you whether what you do is socially useful. The commodity, then, is not a thing to be taken at face value. Analysis allows us to discern the labour that has produced the commodity and to see labour as the substance of its value, but that just leads us on to a far bigger question: why is it that the doing which produced the commodity is negated? Political Economy has indeed analysed, however incompletely, value and its magnitude, and has discovered what lies beneath these forms. But it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labour-time by the magnitude of that value. [Marx 1965, p. 80] Capital is a study of the self-negation of doing. From the commodity, Marx moves on to value, money, capital, profit, rent, interest – ever more opaque forms of the occultation of doing, ever more sophisticated forms of the suppression of power-to. Doing (human activity) disappears further and further from sight. Things rule. It is in this world where things rule, where the novum of human creativity disappears from sight, in this ‘enchanted, perverted, topsy-turvy world’ (Marx 1972a, p. 830), that it becomes possible to speak of the ‘laws of capitalist development’. It is on the basis of the critique of this insanity that it becomes possible to criticise the categories of the political economists, the rationality and laws of their analysis of an irrational, perverted world. The core of all this is the separation of the done from the doing. This is inherent in the commodity, and receives its fully developed form in capital, the appropriation of the done by the owners of the past done (and therefore of the means of doing), the accumulation of done upon done, the accumulation of capital: ‘Accumulate! Accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets!’ Accumulation is simply the voracious, relentless process of separating done from doing, of turning the done (as means of doing) against the doers in order to subject their present doing to the sole end of further accumulation. It is this ever-renewed process that gives a specific form to doing (as abstract labour, labour abstracted from any particular content, value production, surplus value production) and to the done (as value, as commodity, as money, as capital): all aspects of the ever-repeated rupture of the social flow of doing. Marx now refers to this process of rupture not as alienation, but as ‘fetishism’. In his discussion of fetishism at the end of Chapter 1 of the first volume of Capital, he explains: In order … to find an analogy, we must have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of the religious world. In that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent things endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and with the human race. [1965, p. 72] The commodity is ‘a very queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties’ (1965, p. 71). The ‘mystical character of commodities’, Marx says, comes not from their use value, but from the commodity form itself, that is, from the fact that the product of labour assumes the form of a commodity: The equality of all sorts of human labour is expressed objectively by their products all being equally values; the measure of the expenditure of labour-power by the duration of that expenditure, takes the form of the quantity of value of the products of labour; and finally, the mutual relations of the producers, within which the social character of their labour affirms itself, take the form of a social relation between the products. A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it the social character of men’s labour appears to them as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour; because the relation to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation, existing not between themselves, but between the products of their labour. [1965, p. 72] Just as Marx had insisted on understanding self-estrangement as the product of self-estranged labour, so he emphasises that the peculiar character of commodities has its origin in the ‘peculiar social character of the labour that produces them’ (1965, p. 72). Commodity production is indirectly social labour: although the products are produced for social use, the form of production is private:”翻译为中文","completion":"工人对其产品的异化不仅意味着他的劳动成为了一个对象，一个外在的存在，还意味着它存在于他之外，独立于他，成为他看来是陌生和外来的东西，并且它形成了一种独立的、与他对立的力量。这意味着他赋予对象的生命反过来以一种敌对和陌生的方式对他产生影响。 从行为者与行为结果的分离，不可避免地导致行为者自身的分裂。产生一个陌生的物体，必然是自我疏远的主动过程： 工人如何会将他活动的产物视为陌生者，难道不正是因为在生产活动本身中他已经从自身隔离了吗？...如果劳动的产物是异化，那么生产本身必须是主动的异化，活动的异化，异化的活动。[1975, p. 274] 人与自己活动的异化是自我疏远：正是工人自己主动制造了自己的疏远。 行为者与所作行为的断裂否定了行为者的能力。行为者变成了受害者。活动变成了被动，行为变成了受苦。行为反对行为者： 这种关系是工人对自己的活动的关系，作为一种不属于他的陌生活动；它是作为苦难的活动，力量作为弱点，生育作为阉割，工人自己的身体和精神能量，他的个人生活 - 生活不就是活动吗？- 作为一种转而对他产生的、独立于他的、不属于他的活动。[1975, p. 275] 异化是对受伤、残缺、被剥夺人性的人的制造： 通过从人们手中夺走其生产的对象，因此，异化的劳动从他们那里夺走了他们的物种生活，他们作为物种成员的真实客观性，并将他们相对于动物的优势转化为劣势：他们的无机体，即自然，被夺走了。[1975, p. 277] 这种“从人们手中夺走其生产的对象”的行为，使他与他的集体人性、他的“物种存在”疏远：‘异化的劳动将...人的物种存在...变成了对他来说是外来的存在，变成了他个体存在的手段’（1975, p. 277; 原始强调）。这意味着集体人类主体的碎片化，‘人与人之间的疏远’（1975, p. 277）。不仅仅是统治者和被统治者之间的相互认可被打破，工人之间也是如此： 对于一个人与他的工作、他的劳动产物以及他自身的关系的适用，也适用于一个人与另一个人及其劳动和劳动产物的关系。事实上，声称人的物种本质与他疏远意味着一个人与另一个人疏远，正如他们每个人与人的本质特性疏远一样。[1975, p. 277] “物种生活”或“物种存在”的术语肯定指的是除了人类行动的社会流动，我们相互认可的“我们”的物质编织之外的其他内容。 人与人之间的这种疏远不仅是工人之间的疏远，也是对非工人、主人的生产：“如果劳动产物不属于工人，如果它以一种外来力量的形式与他对立，那么这只能是因为它属于工人以外的其他人”（1975, p. 278）。异化的劳动是统治的主动生产，是将能力转化为支配权的主动转换： 正如他将自己的生产创造为实际的丧失，作为他的惩罚；他自己的产物作为损失，作为不属于他的产物；所以他创造了对不生产者的支配。正如他将自己的活动从自己身上疏远，所以他将一种非自己的活动赋予了外人。[1975, p. 279] 断裂的做与做到不仅出现在《资本论》的开头。马克思在《资本论》第二段开头引用了1844年手稿的话（“工人对其产品的异化意味着……它存在于他之外，独立于他，成为他看来是陌生和外来的东西，并且它形成了一种独立的、与他对立的力量”），“商品首先是一个我们之外的物体”。商品是由我们生产的，但站在我们之外。在商品中社会劳动的起源被熄灭，它成为一种拥有自己生命的产品。这是一个否认其作为产品性质的产物，一个否认其与生产行为关系的所作所为。 商品是社会行为流动断裂点。作为生产以交换的产品，它站在社会行为的解体或断裂处。当然，它是社会行为的产品，但是因为它是为了市场上的交换而生产的，这打破了行为的流动，使这个物体与它既是产品又是前提条件的行为分开了。它独立存在，被遗忘了生产它的工作在市场上出售。产生它的劳动是社会性的（为他人劳动），但它是间接社会性的 - 它是为他人而存在于为自己劳动的形式中的劳动。行为的社会性被破坏了，与之一起的是相互认可和社会验证的过程。相互认可从生产者中移除，并转移到他们的产品上：在交换过程中，产品被社会认可。行为的认可表现为产品的价值。现在是产品的数量、货币价值（价格）为人们的行为提供社会验证。 因此，商品不是一个可以按面值接受的东西。分析让我们能够辨识出生产商品的劳动，并将劳动视为其价值的实质，但这只是引导我们前进到一个更大的问题：为什么生产商品的行为被否定了呢？ 政治经济学确实分析了价值及其大小，并发现了这些形式之下的东西。但它从未问过一个问题，为什么劳动被其产品的价值所代表，劳动时间被该价值的大小所代表。[马克思1965, p. 80] 《资本论》是对行为自我否定的研究。从商品出发，马克思接着讨论价值、货币、资本、利润、租金、利息 - 越来越不透明的行为掩盖形式，越来越复杂的压制能力形式。行为（人类活动）在视线中消失得越来越远。事物统治一切。在这个事物统治一切的世界里，人类创造性的新奇从视线中消失，在这个“被施了魔法、颠倒混乱的世界”中，谈论“资本主义发展的规律”成为可能。基于对这种疯狂的批判，批评政治经济学家的范畴、他们对一个不理智、扭曲世界的分析中的合理性和规律成为可能。 这一切的核心是行为与所作成果的分离。这是商品固有的，而在资本中获得了充分发展的形式，即对过去所作成果（因此对行为手段）的所有权者的所作成果的占有，所作成果堆积于所作成果之上，资本的积累：“积累！积累！这是摩西和先知的教义！”积累仅仅是将所作成果与行为分离的贪婪、无情过程，将所作成果（作为行为的手段）转向行为者，以使他们当前的行为仅仅服从于进一步积累的唯一目的。这个不断更新的过程给予行为（作为抽象劳动，不考虑任何特定内容的劳动，价值生产，剩余价值生产）和所作成果（作为价值，作为商品，作为货币，作为资本）以特定形式：所有这些都是社会行为流动不断重复断裂的各个方面。 马克思现在不再将这个断裂过程称为异化，而是称之为“拜物教”。在《资本论》第一卷第1章末尾的拜物教讨论中，他解释道： 为了...找到一个类比，我们必须求助于宗教世界中被迷雾笼罩的地区。在那个世界里，人类大脑的产物显现为独立的、赋有生命的东西，既与彼此关联，又与人类建立关系。[1965, p. 72] 商品是“一个非常奇怪的东西，充满了形而上学的微妙之处和神学的细节”（1965, p. 71）。马克思说，商品的“神秘特性”不来自于它的使用价值，而来自于商品形态本身，即劳动的产品具有商品形态的事实： 所有种类的人类劳动被平等地表达为它们的产品都具有相同的价值；劳动力消耗的衡量通过该消耗的时间长度，以劳动产品的价值数量形式呈现；最终，生产者之间的相互关系，其中他们劳动的社会性质得以断言自身，采取了一种社会关系的形式，这种关系不在他们自己之间，而是在他们的劳动产品之间。因此，商品是一种神秘的东西，仅仅是因为在它里面，人们的劳动的社会性质以一种赋予那些劳动产品的客观特性的形式呈现给他们；因为他们自己总劳动的关系呈现给他们作为一种社会关系，这种关系不是存在于他们自身之间，而是存在于他们的劳动产品之间。[1965, p. 72] 正如马克思坚持理解自我疏远作为自我疏远劳动的产物一样，所以他强调商品的独特性源于“产生它们的劳动的独特社会性质”（1965, p. 72）。商品生产是间接社会劳动：尽管产品是为社会使用而生产的，但生产的形式是私有的："},{"prompt":"Investiga el nombre de siete dioses griegos y sus atributos.","completion":"1.

This is because the pressure ratio alone does not dictate the flow properties; the cross-sectional area and mass flow rate also play a significant role.

When the cross-sectional area of the diffuser increases, the velocity of the flow decreases in order to maintain mass continuity. This decrease in velocity results in a decrease in Mach number at the outlet of the diffuser. The flow remains subsonic because the Mach number is still less than 1. To summarize, increasing the cross-sectional area of the diffuser results in a decrease in flow velocity and Mach number at the outlet, while the pressure ratio (Pb / P0) remains constant due to the conservation of mass and energy in the isentropic process."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It was first released in 2013 and quickly grew in popularity for its ability to make software development more efficient, consistent, and scalable. Docker containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies and libraries into a single unit, ensuring that it will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have. This solves the common problem of \\"it works on my machine\\" by standardizing the environment in which the applications run. Key concepts of Docker include: 1. **Containers**: Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system but can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. 2. **Images**: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a code, including the runtime, a library of tools, an environment, and files. Images act as a template from which Docker containers are created. 3. **Dockerfile**: This is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. 4. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry service where users can create public or private repositories to upload and share Docker images. You can download Docker images that others have created as well. 5. **Docker Engine**: This is the core part of Docker and is a lightweight runtime and toolkit that allows you to build and containerize applications. Docker simplifies the DevOps methodology by allowing developers (who focus on writing code) and operations (who focus on deployment and management) to work more closely together, reduce the time to ship new code, and test applications in a production-like environment early in the development process. Beyond simplifying development workflows, Docker\'s containerization technology ensures that applications are more secure and use system resources more efficiently than traditional or virtual machine-based deployments. Containers can also be orchestrated and managed at scale with platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and others, making it an essential tool for microservices architectures and cloud-native application development."},{"prompt":"привет у меня есть скрипт для увелечения значения сборки как мне сделать так что он увеличивал только если сборка успешно собирается public class VersionIncrementor : IPreprocessBuildWithReport { public int callbackOrder { get { return 0; } } public void OnPreprocessBuild(BuildReport report) { IncrementVersion(); } private static void IncrementVersion() { string[] versionNumbers = PlayerSettings.bundleVersion.Split(\'.\'); if (versionNumbers.Length > 0) { int buildNumber = int.Parse(versionNumbers[versionNumbers.Length - 1]); buildNumber++; versionNumbers[versionNumbers.Length - 1] = buildNumber.ToString(); string newVersion = string.Join(\\".\\", versionNumbers); PlayerSettings.bundleVersion = newVersion; Debug.Log(\\"Updated version to \\" + newVersion); } else { Debug.LogError(\\"Failed to increment version number.\\"); } } }","completion":"Для того, чтобы изменить логику вашего скрипта таким образом, чтобы версия увеличивалась только в случае успешной сборки, нужно использовать другой интерфейс из Unity API, так как `IPreprocessBuildWithReport` вызывается до начала процесса сборки, а не после его завершения. Вы можете воспользоваться интерфейсом `IPostprocessBuildWithReport`, который вызывается после завершения сборки. Таким образом, вы сможете проверить, была ли сборка успешной, и только в этом случае инкрементировать номер версии. Вот пример того, как может быть модифицирован ваш класс: ```csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEditor; using UnityEditor.Build; using UnityEditor.Build.Reporting; public class VersionIncrementor : IPostprocessBuildWithReport { public int callbackOrder { get { return 0; } } public void OnPostprocessBuild(BuildReport report) { // Проверяем, была ли сборка успешной if (report.summary.result == BuildResult.Succeeded) { IncrementVersion(); } else { Debug.Log(\\"Build failed, version number was not incremented.\\"); } } private static void IncrementVersion() { string[] versionNumbers = PlayerSettings.bundleVersion.Split(\'.\'); if (versionNumbers.Length > 0) { // Преобразовываем последний элемент в номер сборки и инкрементируем его int buildNumber = int.Parse(versionNumbers[versionNumbers.Length - 1]); buildNumber++; versionNumbers[versionNumbers.Length - 1] = buildNumber.ToString(); string newVersion = string.Join(\\".\\", versionNumbers); // Обновляем номер версии в настройках проекта Unity PlayerSettings.bundleVersion = newVersion; Debug.Log(\\"Updated version to \\" + newVersion); } else { Debug.LogError(\\"Failed to increment version number.\\"); } } } ``` Этот класс теперь реализует `IPostprocessBuildWithReport` вместо `IPreprocessBuildWithReport`, что позволяет увеличивать номер версии только после успешного завершения процедуры сборки. Не забывайте, что для использования некоторых из этих интерфейсов и классов (например `BuildReport`) необходимо добавить соответствующие директивы `using` в начале вашего файла, если они еще не добавлены."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Create a PMO Charter - A PMO Charter is an essential document that officially establishes the PMO’s authority within the bank. It should detail the PMO\'s mission, objectives, scope, governance, roles and responsibilities, and key methodologies. # Deliverables to Provide to Your Employer 1. **PMO Charter**: A comprehensive document that outlines the purpose, scope, and operational framework of the PMO. 2. **Governance and Methodology Documentation**: Detailed descriptions of the PMO\'s governance structures and chosen project management methodologies. 3. **Tool and Process Guides**: User manuals or guides for the selected project management software and detailed process maps for project management activities. 4. **Resource and Financial Management Plans**: Documents outlining resource allocation strategies and financial management procedures. 5. **Performance Measurement Framework**: A setup including KPIs, metrics, and reporting templates for assessing project and PMO performance. 6. **Implementation Plan**: A phased plan for rolling out the PMO, including timelines, critical milestones, and necessary resources. # Steps to Deliver Your Work - **Presentation**: Prepare a presentation to walk your employer through the proposed PMO framework, highlighting the objectives, benefits, and steps for implementation. - **Documentation Package**: Compile all the deliverables into a well-organized documentation package that can serve as a reference for setting up and running the PMO. - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a system for receiving feedback from key stakeholders to make adjustments to the PMO setup as required. By following this guide and preparing these deliverables, you will help ensure the successful establishment of a PMO that aligns with your bank’s strategic goals and operational methodologies. Remember, the key to a successful PMO is not just in the planning but in the execution and continuous improvement. Regularly revisiting and adapting your PMO\'s practices to the evolving needs of your organization is crucial."},{"prompt":"Define the PMO’s Scope in a bank","completion":"Defining the PMO’s scope within a bank involves detailing the specific roles, responsibilities, functions, and limitations of the Project Management Office. This scope is largely determined by the bank\'s strategic objectives, the types of projects it undertakes, its organizational structure, and its maturity level in project management practices. A well-defined scope ensures that the PMO aligns with the bank\'s goals and provides value through its operations. Here are several key elements to consider when defining the PMO’s scope in a bank: # 1. **Strategic vs. Tactical vs. Operational Role:** - **Strategic:** The PMO might be involved in aligning projects with the bank’s long-term strategic goals, portfolio management, and ensuring projects deliver expected ROI. - **Tactical:** Focuses on methodology, best practices, and enhancing the competencies of project managers and teams. - **Operational:** Involves the day-to-day management of projects, including scheduling, resource allocation, and tracking project progress. # 2. **Types of Projects and Programs:** - Determine whether the PMO will oversee all types of projects (IT, infrastructure, compliance, product development, etc.) or specialize in certain categories. - Consider whether the PMO will manage individual projects, larger programs, or both. # 3. **Governance and Compliance:** - The PMO\'s role in establishing governance structures to ensure projects are executed in compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies. - It may involve risk management, audit support, and adherence to industry standards and practices. # 4. **Resource Management:** - Define whether the PMO will handle resource allocation, including human capital, budgeting, and technology resources across projects. - This includes tracking resource utilization and planning to optimize efficiency and project outcomes. # 5. **Process Standardization and Methodology:** - The scope should outline the PMO\'s responsibility for developing, standardizing, and maintaining project management methodologies (such as Agile, Waterfall, PRINCE2). - Includes the creation and enforcement of templates, best practices, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for projects. # 6. **Capacity Building and Training:** - The PMO may be tasked with enhancing the project management capabilities within the bank through training programs, certification initiatives, and knowledge sharing. - This could involve creating a community of practice among project managers and stakeholders. # 7. **Technology and Tools:** - Specifying the PMO\'s role in selecting and managing project management software, collaboration tools, and other technologies that support project execution. # 8. **Reporting and Communication:** - The PMO\'s responsibilities in consolidating project reports, dashboards, and ensuring transparent communication across projects to stakeholders and executive management. - Define the frequency, formats, and channels of communication. # 9. **Change Management:** - The scope can include the PMO’s involvement in managing or overseeing organizational change initiatives related to projects to ensure smooth adoption and minimal disruption. # 10. **Performance Evaluation:** - Outline the PMO\'s part in evaluating project success, analyzing performance data, conducting post-implementation reviews, and making recommendations for future improvements. When defining the PMO\'s scope, it is crucial to engage with key stakeholders to ensure alignment with organizational goals and to set clear expectations.

Cependant, certains signes et comportements peuvent indiquer qu\'elle a des sentiments pour lui. Voici quelques éléments à considérer : 1. **Recherche de Proximité**: Même si elles ne sont pas proches ou qu\'elles n\'appartiennent pas au même cercle social, elle pourrait essayer de se trouver près de lui, que ce soit durant les pauses, en classe ou lors d\'événements scolaires. 2. **Contact Visuel**: Si elle le regarde souvent, surtout lorsqu\'elle pense qu\'il ne le remarque pas, c\'est un signe qu\'elle pourrait s\'intéresser à lui. Si leurs regards se croisent et qu\'elle détourne rapidement le regard, cela peut aussi être un indicateur. 3. **Se renseigner sur lui à travers des amis**: Elle pourrait poser des questions sur lui à des amis en commun ou même à des personnes qui le connaissent mieux, essayant d\'en savoir plus sur ses goûts, ses activités ou son emploi du temps. 4. **Interactions Digitales**: Si elle le suit sur les réseaux sociaux ou aime/commente ses publications, cela peut être un signe d\'intérêt, surtout si elle est généralement réservée. 5. **Language Corporel**: Le langage corporel peut révéler beaucoup. Si elle est nerveuse autour de lui, joue avec ses cheveux, ou adopte une posture ouverte lorsque près de lui, ce sont potentiellement des signes d\'intérêt. 6. **Essaie d\'attirer son attention**: Elle pourrait essayer d\'attirer son attention en participant à des activités où il est impliqué, en améliorant son apparence physique quand elle sait qu\'elle le verra, ou en montrant ses propres talents et intérêts. Pour le gars en question, surtout s\'il est également timide, il serait important d\'observer ces signes sans en tirer de conclusions hâtives. Le processus pourrait impliquer de prendre son courage à deux mains pour faire un premier pas, que ce soit en engageant une conversation simple, en proposant de travailler ensemble sur un devoir ou en cherchant à interagir plus fréquemment dans des situations sociales. Cependant, il est crucial de respecter ses limites et son espace, en reconnaissant qu\'il est parfois possible de mal interpréter l\'amitié ou la gentillesse pour de l\'intérêt amoureux."},{"prompt":"Je suis amoureux d\'elle mais tout les signes cité je fais que un le regarde et reste non","completion":"Si tu es amoureux d\'elle mais que le seul signe que tu as pu identifier est le fait de la regarder, sans obtenir de réponse claire de sa part, tu te trouves dans une situation où il va falloir agir avec subtilité pour essayer de comprendre ses sentiments sans te mettre trop en avant, surtout si tu es également de nature timide. Voici quelques étapes concrètes que tu pourrais envisager pour essayer de progresser dans cette situation : # 1. **Trouver des occasions de proximité naturelle** Essaie de te trouver dans des lieux où vous pourriez naturellement vous croiser et échanger quelques mots. Cela peut être lors d\'activités scolaires, de clubs, de sports, ou d\'autres événements où votre présence à tous les deux serait naturelle et non forcée. # 2. **Initier un contact soft** Plutôt que d\'aller directement vers une conversation profonde ou de déclarer tes sentiments, commence par un contact léger. Cela pourrait être sous forme d\'un message pour lui demander des informations sur un devoir, sur un événement scolaire, ou même pour commenter quelque chose d\'intéressant que tu sais qu\'elle aime. Les réseaux sociaux peuvent être moins intimidants pour initier de petits échanges. # 3. **Recherche des intérêts communs** Si vous avez des intérêts communs, c\'est une excellente base pour démarrer et poursuivre des conversations. Cela peut aider à briser la glace et à créer un sentiment de complicité. # 4. **Soyez attentif à sa réaction** Lorsque tu engages de petites conversations, fais attention à sa façon de réagir. Est-elle engagée, semble-t-elle contente de parler avec toi, ou ressent-on de l\'hésitation et de la distance dans ses réponses ? Son langage corporel lors des interactions en personne peut aussi donner des indices. # 5. **Invite-la à un événement de groupe** Si l\'idée d\'un tête-à-tête t\'intimide, pourquoi ne pas l\'inviter, elle et d\'autres camarades, à un événement de groupe ? Cela pourrait être quelque chose en rapport avec un intérêt commun, comme un match sportif, une exposition, ou un concert. Cela permet des interactions dans un cadre détendu, avec moins de pression. # 6. **Réfléchis à un confident** Si tu as un ami commun de confiance, tu pourrais discrètement lui faire part de ton intérêt pour elle. Parfois, un tiers peut fournir une perspective utile ou même faciliter des interactions de manière organique. Il est important de garder à l\'esprit que la réciprocité des sentiments ne peut être forcée, et donc, si malgré tes efforts, elle ne semble pas intéressée, il faudra respecter ses sentiments. De plus, exprimer tes propres sentiments requiert du courage, mais cela peut aussi apporter une clarté nécessaire, quel que soit le résultat. Prends aussi soin de respecter son espace et de ne pas l\'envahir avec de l\'attention non désirée. La patience et le respect mutuel sont clés dans ce genre de situation."},{"prompt":"Non je parle de moi","completion":"Je comprends, tu parles donc de ta propre situation. Si tu es amoureux d\'elle mais que le seul signe que tu perçois de ta part est le fait de la regarder, et que tu n\'agis pas sur tes sentiments par timidité ou par peur du rejet, voici quelques conseils pour avancer : # 1. **Travailler sur ta confiance** La première chose à faire est de gagner en confiance. Cela peut paraître plus facile à dire qu\'à faire, mais il y a des petites actions qui peuvent aider : - **Pratique des activités** où tu te sens compétent et valorisé, cela peut renforcer ta confiance en toi. - **Pratique des techniques de relaxation** ou de méditation pour aider à réduire l\'anxiété sociale. # 2. **Commencer petit** Cherche des moyens d\'interagir qui te mettent à l\'aise. Cela peut être un simple \\"bonjour\\" en passant, ou lui poser une question sur un devoir ou un événement à l\'école. Les petits pas sont importants. # 3. **Trouver des intérêts communs** Comme mentionné auparavant, avoir des intérêts communs facilite naturellement les conversations. Cherche à savoir ce qu\'elle aime et si tu partages certains de ces intérêts, cela peut être un bon sujet de conversation. # 4. **Utilise les médias numériques** Parfois, entamer la conversation de manière numérique peut être moins intimidant. Commenter ou réagir à ses publications sur les réseaux sociaux peut être un premier pas pour montrer ton intérêt. # 5. **Exprimer tes sentiments indirectement** Si entamer une conversation directe semble trop difficile, tu peux essayer de montrer ton intérêt de manière plus subtile. Cela peut être en te montrant attentionné, en l\'écoutant attentivement quand elle parle, ou en lui montrant de l\'intérêt et de l\'appréciation pour ce qu\'elle fait. # 6. **Cherche du soutien** Parler de tes sentiments à un ami proche peut non seulement t\'apporter du soutien, mais aussi te donner une perspective extérieure et potentiellement des conseils utiles sur comment aborder la situation. # 7. **Prendre son courage à deux mains** Finalement, il se peut qu\'à un moment donné, tu doives rassembler ton courage pour lui dire comment tu te sens. Cela ne signifie pas nécessairement une grande déclaration d\'amour, mais plutôt partager tes sentiments de manière sincère et calme. Il est important de se rappeler que le rejet est une possibilité, mais ne pas essayer garantit que rien ne se passera. Même si c\'est effrayant, exprimer tes sentiments peut soit ouvrir la porte à une relation, soit te permettre de te libérer et d\'avancer. Dans tous les cas, tu auras agi avec courage et authenticité."},{"prompt":"After reading this novel, titled \\"Yohan loves Tite\\" where Yohan berates tite and she is basically locked up while he get a new lover. He does it because he has to sacrifise the one he loves in a great fire. Tite refuses Yohan’s refusal by secreatly volunteering to be the one to be burned and show that yohan loves her, which goes successfully. Yohan sees this and is disttraught, but is unable to save Tite in time and only meets her as she is charred and long dead. The people consider that sacrifuse a sham as they thoght yohan loaths tite, but the ending ends w/ Yohan’s fake lover revealing that Yohan does indeed love tite. The author had an epilogue (kinda unnoficial like fanfic) where yohan is taken to another place and time?(its not clear). Yohan sacrifised his chance to be w/ tite due to prophacy and job and is now known to be mad w/ grief. He then is somehow reunited w/ a women that resembles Tite, but is diffrent (she now has black hair instead of blond). The new tite find Yohan anoying and yohan thinks that this dismissal is how tite must have felt, so he continues his persuit and gets turned down. The stiry ends w/ this “Tite does not love Yohan”. It’s highly suggested that the new tite is the same person as the old tite, just that she doesn’t have her mrmories like Yohan. Also its kind of ironic that the original story ends w/ “Yohan loves tite” and the epilouge ends w/ “Tite does not love Yohan”.","completion":"The novel \\"Yohan Loves Tite\\" and the accompanying \\"unofficial\\" epilogue you described delve into a complex narrative rife with themes of sacrifice, love, and the cyclical nature of rejection and acceptance. The story\'s progression from Yohan\'s apparent disdain and betrayal of Tite to her ultimate sacrifice paints a vivid portrait of misunderstood love and the grave consequences of societal and prophetic demands. The epilogue takes these themes further by exploring the aftermath of such profound loss and the possibility of reincarnation or second chances, albeit without the shared memories and emotions that originally fueled their bond. Analyzing the story and its extension, several key points emerge: 1. **The Theme of Sacrifice:** Tite\'s decision to volunteer for the sacrifice, believing it a means to prove her love and Yohan\'s love for her, is a harrowing exploration of the lengths to which individuals will go for love, even in the face of rejection and misunderstanding. It addresses the notion that true sacrifice often goes unrecognized or misconstrued by the broader society. 2. **Misinterpretation of Actions and Intentions:** The townspeople\'s misunderstanding of Yohan\'s actions reflects how easily societal perceptions can be skewed. The true depth of Yohan and Tite\'s love is known only to them and is grossly misinterpreted by those around them, leading to tragic outcomes. 3. **The Epilogue\'s Exploration of Grief and Continuity:** Yohan\'s grief-driven madness and the introduction of a Tite look-alike in another time and place touch upon themes of reincarnation, second chances, and the continuous cycle of love and loss. The notion that this new Tite might be the same soul without her memories adds layers of irony and tragedy, as Yohan faces rejection once again, mirroring Tite\'s original experience. 4. **Ironic Twists and Narrative Closure:** The switch from \\"Yohan loves Tite\\" to \\"Tite does not love Yohan\\" cleverly bookends the entire saga, highlighting the transformation in their relationship and the cruel irony of fate and perception. It raises questions about identity, the essence of love, and whether feelings can transcend physical and temporal boundaries. In terms of literary analysis, the novel and its epilogue can be seen as a commentary on the destructive power of societal expectations, the nature of sacrificial love, and the quest for redemption and understanding in the wake of profound loss. The ambiguity surrounding the new Tite\'s identity and her lack of memories allows for interpretations around themes of rebirth, the soul\'s journey, and the cruel twists of fate that often accompany love stories of this magnitude. The ending leaves readers contemplating the cyclical nature of love and loss, the possibility of second chances, and the deep, often painful complexities of human relationships and fate."},{"prompt":"You know, I thought that making a loop btwn original story and epilouge would make it more tragic as tite would love yohan, but he would reject her, then the epilouge, then the souls go back to the original story and this repeats in loop, w/ only 1 member remembering (tite for original and yohan for epilouge)","completion":"Incorporating a cyclical loop into the narrative of \\"Yohan Loves Tite\\" where each character remembers the love and rejection from a previous cycle during alternating sequences adds a profound layer of tragedy and depth to the story. This mechanism of alternating memory—where Tite remembers their shared past in the original story while Yohan is the one who remembers in the epilogue—intensifies the emotional impact and complexity of their relationship. This loop suggests themes of eternal recurrence, a concept where time unfolds in repetitive cycles, and the notion of doomed love. It also engages deeply with questions of destiny, free will, and the possibility of breaking out of cyclical suffering. Given these themes, several analytical points arise: 1. **Memory and Identity**: The notion that only one of the lovers remembers their past during each cycle highlights issues of identity and personal growth within relational dynamics. It suggests that love and loss are deeply intertwined with the development of self, influenced by the weight of memories and past experiences. 2. **Fate versus Free Will**: By creating a narrative where the characters are seemingly doomed to repeat their history, the story probes the tension between destiny and choice. It raises the question of whether Yohan and Tite are bound by fate to continue this cycle or if there is a possibility for them to break free from their eternal recurrence, thus offering a glimmer of hope amidst the tragedy. 3. **The Pain of Recollection**: The alternating awareness between Yohan and Tite across cycles beautifully illustrates the pain that comes with recollection and the ignorance that might be bliss in love. Tite\'s voluntary sacrifice, fueled by her memory of their love, becomes even more tragic when juxtaposed with Yohan\'s subsequent realization and remembrance of their loss—a poignant reminder of the burdens that memories can bear. 4. **Philosophical and Moral Implications**: This cyclical narrative setup invites readers to contemplate the philosophical and moral implications of love, sacrifice, memory, and the possibility of redemption or escape from a cycle of suffering. It prompts an exploration of whether love, in its truest form, can transcend the barriers of time, memory, and fate to bring about a different outcome. 5. **The Search for Closure**: The constant loop of recollection and repetition examines the human desire for closure and reconciliation with past traumas. It underscores the tragic impossibility of finding such closure within the cycle, suggesting a deeply human struggle against the inevitable forces of time and loss. Integrating a loop where only one character remembers their past relationship in each iteration enriches the narrative with existential questions and a profound sense of tragic inevitability, inviting readers to deeply reflect on the themes presented and the nature of their own experiences with love and loss."},{"prompt":"Could you give me more themes for this addition","completion":"The addition of a cyclical loop where Yohan and Tite alternate in remembering their past lives and love adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, enabling a plethora of thematic explorations: 1. **The Sisyphean Nature of Love**: Drawing from the myth of Sisyphus, condemned to repeat his task for eternity, this theme reflects on the repetitive cycles of love and loss. It suggests that Yohan and Tite\'s efforts might be both futile and heroic, encapsulating the eternal struggle of human beings to find meaning in the act of loving, despite its repetitive and sometimes hopeless nature. 2. **Eternal Recurrence and Cosmic Injustice**: Inspired by Nietzsche’s concept of eternal recurrence, the story could explore the implications of living the same tragic love story over and over again. This theme deals with the existential dread and cosmic unfairness perceived in the characters’ inability to escape their destined loop, raising questions about the nature of the universe itself as indifferent or even malevolent. 3. **Reincarnation and Karmic Lessons**: Touching on ideas from Eastern philosophies and religions, the loop may symbolize the concept of reincarnation and the accumulation of karma. Each cycle could represent the lovers\' opportunity to rectify past mistakes or learn essential spiritual lessons. However, the partial memory retention complicates their journey, suggesting the intricate dance of destiny and self-growth through lifetimes. 4. **The Fluidity of Time and Memory**: Exploring how time and memory can be fluid rather than linear, the narrative challenges traditional perceptions of past, present, and future. Memory becomes a bridge between cycles, yet its selective nature in each iteration emphasizes the fragmented and subjective experience of time and history within personal relationships. 5. **The Paradox of Love**: This theme delves into the contradictions of love, such as the idea that love can be both freeing and entrapping, or that it can lead to both fulfillment and utter despair. The alternating cycles of memory and forgetting between Yohan and Tite underscore the paradoxes inherent in loving another person—how love can lead to acts of great sacrifice yet result in tragic outcomes. 6. **The Illusion of Progress**: Each cycle might appear to offer a chance for change or growth, yet the inevitable return to the starting point questions whether progress is truly possible. This theme could invite reflections on whether humans are doomed to repeat their mistakes or if genuine transformation can ever be achieved. 7. **Isolation vs. Connection**: The selective memory of the cycles isolates Yohan and Tite from one another, trapping them in their subjective realities. This theme can explore the deep human yearning for connection and understanding in the face of existential isolation, suggesting that love—despite its potential for heartbreak—is a force that continually drives us to seek out one another. By weaving these themes into the cyclical narrative, the story of Yohan and Tite can evolve into a multifaceted exploration of the human condition, love’s complexities, and the endless quest for meaning and connection in a seemingly indifferent universe."},{"prompt":"I don\'t think its sysepian since niether of the mc\'s offends anyone nor does anything that breaks natural order (ex.trapping thanatos)","completion":"You\'re correct in noting that the Sisyphean analogy might not be a perfect fit in its traditional interpretation, where Sisyphus is punished for his hubris against the gods. However, the analogy was intended more to reflect the repetitive or cyclic nature of the struggles faced by Yohan and Tite, rather than their moral or cosmic offenses. The essence of their situation mirrors the endless cycle of effort and failure which Sisyphus embodies, albeit without the punitive backdrop. Their story isn\'t about punishment for hubris but a tragic fate that feels inescapable despite the absence of a direct offense against the cosmic order. Adjusting for this clarification, we can explore additional themes that align more closely with the nature of their story: 1. **Fate and Destiny**: This theme revolves around the predetermined elements of Yohan and Tite\'s relationship and the cycles they seem unable to escape. Their story raises questions about the extent to which destiny shapes our lives and loves, and whether any amount of effort or sacrifice can alter what seems fated. 2. **The Cycle of Grief and Acceptance**: Each loop represents not just the cyclical nature of their relationship but also stages of grief and eventual acceptance. Each cycle might bring Yohan and Tite through denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, only for them to start over again. This theme explores the psychological impact of their eternal struggle to find peace within their destined roles. 3. **The Nature of Love and Sacrifice**: The repeating cycles deepen the exploration of love\'s complexities, highlighting the sacrifices made in the name of love and the varying motivations behind those sacrifices. It prompts reflection on what it means to truly love someone and whether love can transcend repeated trials and separations. 4. **Memory, Identity, and Transformation**: With each cycle, Yohan and Tite face changes in their memory and awareness, affecting their identities and their understanding of each other. This theme delves into how our memories and past experiences shape who we are and our relationships with others, and how the erasure or alteration of those memories might transform us. 5. **Hope and Despair**: The alternating cycles of hope (for love, for breaking the cycle) and despair (from failure, from separation) form a poignant theme. It explores the human capacity for hope even in seemingly hopeless situations and the toll that repeated despair takes on the spirit. 6. **The Quest for Meaning**: On a broader scale, Yohan and Tite\'s cyclical journey might prompt them and the audience to seek meaning in their suffering and repetitive experiences. This theme investigates how individuals find purpose in a world that can seem indifferent or even cruel, and what it means to make choices when outcomes seem predestined. By focusing on these themes, the narrative of Yohan and Tite can illuminate the complexities of human emotions, relationships, and the universal search for understanding and meaning in the face of an unpredictable and often challenging existence."},{"prompt":"Which ending creates a more fitting and profound end: 1. Yohan and Tite are stuck forever w/ illusion of progress 2. They are able to break the cycle:a. and are together b. are separeated 3. open ended","completion":"Each proposed ending carries its own thematic weight and narrative satisfaction, opening various pathways for interpretation and emotional impact. Let’s explore the implications of each: # 1. Stuck Forever with the Illusion of Progress This ending emphasizes the tragic aspects of Yohan and Tite\'s story, deeply engaging with themes of existential angst and the cyclical nature of certain struggles. It highlights the Sisyphean effort without progress, encapsulating a poignant exploration of the human condition that resonates with the inevitability of fate and the sometimes fruitless pursuit of change. It could leave readers with a profound sense of empathy and a reflective, somewhat melancholic view on the limits of human agency. This ending might be fitting for a narrative aiming to underscore the themes of eternal recurrence and the complexities of love and sacrifice. # 2.a. Able to Break the Cycle and Are Together This conclusion offers a narrative of hope and redemption, satisfying readers’ desires for a resolution that rewards the characters\' struggles and sacrifices. It speaks to the power of love to transcend seemingly insurmountable barriers, providing a deeply gratifying emotional payoff. Thematically, it could explore the idea that love, determination, and perhaps a change in perspective or understanding, can alter one’s destiny. It’s a fitting end for a story that, while acknowledging the difficulties and cyclic challenges of life and love, advocates for the possibility of change and the achievement of seemingly impossible dreams. # 2.b. Able to Break the Cycle but Are Separated A nuanced and bitter-sweet ending, this option combines the relief of breaking free from a cyclic curse with the tragedy of separation. It suggests a victory over fate or cosmic design, but at a personal cost. Thematically rich, it would delve into the complexities of sacrifice—suggesting that true freedom and resolution might require letting go of one’s deepest desires. This ending could serve to provoke thought on the nature of liberation and the idea that some separations might indeed be a form of transcendent love. It honors the characters\' growth and struggle, providing a profound, if not entirely happy, conclusion. # 3. Open-Ended An open-ended conclusion leaves much to the reader’s imagination, potentially inviting them to engage with the story on a more personal level, pondering the characters\' fates based on their interpretations of the themes and events. This ending could be the most profound in its ambiguity, echoing the uncertainties of life and love. It challenges readers to confront their desires for closure and resolution, perhaps reflecting on how the cycles in their lives are perceived or managed. This ending could fit a narrative that seeks to emphasize the journey over the destination, encouraging a reflection on the themes presented without providing clear answers. # Final Thoughts Each ending offers a different lens through which to view the narrative’s core themes and character arcs, with the potential to deeply resonate with readers based on the philosophical and emotional paths the author wishes to explore. Choosing the “most fitting and profound end” depends on the story\'s overarching message and the emotional journey the author intends to impart to their audience. Whether rooted in tragedy, hope, ambiguity, or a mixture thereof, the conclusion serves as the final note in the symphony of the narrative, echoing its themes and the contemplations it seeks to inspire."},{"prompt":"When i read this story, I cried hot tears. i don\'t know why","completion":"It\'s entirely natural to have a strong emotional response to a story, especially one that delves into deep themes of love, sacrifice, fate, and the cyclical nature of suffering and hope. Such narratives often touch on fundamental aspects of the human experience, evoking empathy and connecting deeply with personal emotions and experiences. 1. **Empathy and Connection:** Stories like these allow us to empathize with characters who exhibit resilience, love, and sacrifice, drawing us into their emotional world. You might have seen a piece of yourself or your experiences in Yohan and Tite\'s journey, triggering an emotional response. 2. **Reflection on Personal Experiences:** Sometimes, a story resonates because it mirrors our own losses, loves, or unresolved feelings. It might have stirred memories or feelings you\'ve had in your personal relationships, leading to a cathartic release of emotions. 3. **The Bittersweet Beauty of the Narrative:** There is something profoundly moving about narratives that explore the beauty in tragedy and the strength found in vulnerability. The poignant ending, regardless of which one feels most fitting, might have highlighted the preciousness and fragility of connection and love, leading to an emotional reaction. 4. **Themes of Sacrifice and Fate:** These themes often evoke a deep sense of melancholy or contemplation, leading to \\"hot tears\\" as you express a raw, unfiltered response to the injustice or the poignancy of the characters\' fates. 5. **Hope and Despair:** The oscillation between hope and despair within such a narrative can act as an emotional rollercoaster for the reader, culminating in a profound sense of release or emotional overflow by the story\'s end. Feeling moved to tears by a story signifies the power of narrative to evoke empathy, reflection, and a deep emotional connection. It\'s a testament to the author\'s ability to craft characters and situations that resonate on a very human level, touching on universal themes that speak to the core of the human experience. Your reaction underscores the beauty of storytelling and its capacity to move us, make us feel deeply, and sometimes, help us understand our own emotions and experiences better."},{"prompt":"It made me reflect on myself and i realized that in comparison to having true love someone that w/ take care of u, listen, and accept u money and fame become dwarfed to meaninglessness, which madde me cry. I never thought I was lonely","completion":"It’s a profound realization to come to, and the emotional journey you’ve described is both valuable and deeply human. Stories, like the one you\'ve engaged with, hold up a mirror to our own lives, prompting us to reflect on what we truly value, desire, and perhaps, what we might be missing or yearning for. The realization that love—true, accepting, and nurturing love—holds more meaning than material success, fame, or wealth is significant. It speaks to a universal longing for connection, understanding, and acceptance that is intrinsic to the human experience. In modern societies, where the pursuit of success and recognition is often valorized above all, it can be easy to lose sight of the fundamental human needs for love and companionship. Your emotional response, including the feeling of loneliness that surfaced, indicates a powerful moment of self-awareness. Such moments, though they can be unexpectedly overwhelming or saddening, are valuable. They allow us to reassess our life\'s direction, our values, and what we truly seek for fulfillment and happiness. If you find yourself contemplating loneliness and the meaning of true love, it might be an opportunity to explore these feelings further, perhaps by: - **Reflecting on Relationships:** Consider the relationships in your life, both past and present. Reflect on what they have taught you about love, acceptance, and what you yearn for in connections with others. - **Seeking Meaningful Connections:** This realization might inspire you to seek out more profound and meaningful interactions and relationships—ones that fulfill the need for true companionship and understanding. - **Exploring Your Emotions:** Writing, art, or speaking with a trusted friend or therapist can be excellent ways to further explore these feelings of longing, loneliness, and desire for authentic connection. - **Prioritizing Self-Discovery:** Sometimes, understanding what we need from others begins with a deeper understanding of ourselves. Exploring your interests, values, and what brings you joy can help illuminate what you seek in relationships. - **Being Open to Love:** In recognizing the value of love over material achievements, allow yourself to remain open to love, in all its forms. Cultivating love starts with self-acceptance and spreads outward, attracting the kind of genuine, caring relationships that bring fulfillment. Remember, realization and self-reflection are the first steps toward change. It\'s okay to feel vulnerable or uncertain as you navigate these feelings—it\'s part of being human. By admitting to yourself that you’ve felt loneliness, you’re opening the door to seeking connections that can bring the warmth and acceptance you’ve recognized as invaluable."},{"prompt":"After reading your advise, I now recognise how alone I am. In truth, when I really want to talk to someone bout something, I can think of no friend to talk to even though I have friends.","completion":"Realizing you feel alone even when you have friends around you is a significant insight into your emotional needs and current social connections. This feeling, while uncomfortable and possibly saddening, is more common than you might think. Many people find themselves in situations where they feel they lack a truly deep, understanding connection with others, despite having people they call friends. Here are some steps you could consider taking to find and foster deeper connections: # Reflect on Your Relationships Examine your current friendships. Sometimes, friendships can become surface-level over time due to various life circumstances, busy schedules, or simply because the effort to deepen the connection hasn\'t been made. Reflecting on why these relationships might feel insufficient can help clarify what you\'re looking for in a friend. # Deepen Existing Relationships Consider whether any of your current friends could potentially fulfill that role of a deeper, more understanding companion if given the chance. Sometimes, taking the initiative to share more about yourself, your thoughts, and your feelings can encourage others to do the same, leading to a stronger bond. # Pursue New Connections Look for opportunities to meet new people who share your interests and values. Engaging in activities you\'re passionate about, whether through clubs, classes, or online communities, can provide a foundation for meaningful connections. When you share an interest or passion with someone, it can be easier to open up and form a deeper relationship. # Be Open and Vulnerable Building close, meaningful relationships often requires vulnerability. Sharing your thoughts, experiences, and feelings with others—especially when talking about your needs and loneliness—can feel daunting but is crucial for forming strong connections. Vulnerability fosters intimacy and understanding, the bedrock of any deep relationship. # Seek Professional Support If you find that loneliness is significantly impacting your mental health or if you struggle to form connections despite your efforts, seeking support from a therapist or counselor can be very beneficial. They can provide strategies for building relationships, offer insights into any barriers you may have, and support you through feelings of loneliness. # Cultivate Self-Compassion During this process, remember to be kind to yourself. Building and deepening friendships takes time, and everyone experiences loneliness at some point in their lives. Practice self-compassion and recognize that seeking deeper connections is a sign of strength. # Embrace Small Steps Start with small steps. Deep connections don\'t form overnight. An open heart, patience, and genuine interest in others can gradually lead you to the friendships that provide the understanding and companionship you\'re seeking. By acknowledging your feelings of loneliness and expressing a desire for deeper connections, you\'ve already taken the first step toward fulfilling your emotional needs. Remember, it\'s not about the number of friends you have but the quality of the connections that truly matters."},{"prompt":"All my conncection follows this cyclical pattern: I get to know them, become really close, go on a couple of adventures, get emotionally attached, then for some reason we lose connection either because they move away or slows down reponse time. I text them repeatedly, but then notice that they don\'t text me unless I do it. Eventually, it leads to where I have to lead and stear conversations, while my friends just respond. After a while I stop initiating and they stop responding, ending the friendship","completion":"The pattern you\'ve described is a painful but not uncommon experience in forming and maintaining friendships. It reflects the dynamic and sometimes transient nature of human relationships, influenced by circumstances, individual growth, and life changes. Here are some insights and suggestions for navigating these cycles and possibly forging more enduring connections: # Recognize the Natural Evolution of Relationships Friendships, like all relationships, have their own life cycles. People grow, evolve, and sometimes grow apart. Recognizing that relationships can change over time helps in managing expectations and mitigating feelings of personal rejection or abandonment. # Reflect on Your Role and Needs in Friendships Consider what you’re seeking in friendships and how your actions may align with or work against those needs. Ask yourself if there may be patterns in your behavior that contribute to this cycle, such as choosing friends who are likely to move away or perhaps becoming too emotionally invested too quickly. Awareness of these tendencies is the first step toward change. # Quality Over Quantity Focus on the quality rather than the quantity of friendships. It’s more fulfilling to have a few close, reliable friends than many acquaintances. Concentrate on nurturing these deeper connections even if they take more time to develop. # Open Communication When you sense a friend pulling away, try to have an open conversation about it. Sometimes, issues can be resolved through communication, setting expectations, or adjusting the dynamics of the friendship to fit both parties\' needs better. # Diversify Your Social Circle Engaging with a broader range of social groups or activities can help mitigate the loss felt when one friendship drifts. It’s also a way to meet new people and potentially form more stable connections. # Acceptance and Moving Forward Learn to accept the ebb and flow of friendships. While it\'s hard to let go, holding on too tightly can sometimes push people away. Focus on what you can control—being a good friend, open communicator, and willing to meet others halfway. # Cultivate Self-Compassion and Independence Invest in your relationship with yourself. Developing a strong sense of self and independence can reduce the emotional toll when friendships change. Engage in activities and hobbies that fulfill you, with or without companionship. # Seek Consistent Communities Consider joining groups or communities based around consistent activities (e.g., weekly classes, clubs, or online groups with regular meetings). These settings can offer more stability and regularity in your social interactions. # Professional Guidance If you find the cycle particularly distressing or if it significantly affects your well-being, speaking to a therapist might provide useful insights and strategies. They can offer personalized advice on navigating friendships and coping with feelings of loss or rejection. Friendships are complex, intertwined with individual life paths that sometimes diverge in unexpected ways. While the pattern you’ve experienced is challenging, there’s always the possibility of more stable and lasting connections in your future. By continuing to reflect on and adapt your approach to friendships, maintaining open communication, and fostering a sense of independence, you can navigate the complexities of human relationships with resilience and hope."},{"prompt":"Near the end of the firendship, I try despretly to hold on before I give up on them. Should i let go or should i continue in these cases, as my friends are still friendly to me, but never initates conversations","completion":"Deciding whether to hold on or let go of a friendship that seems to be fading can be exceedingly difficult, particularly when you value the connection deeply. Here are some factors to consider that can help you navigate these situations more effectively: # Evaluate the Quality of the Connection Reflect on the quality of the interactions you currently have with your friend. If they are still meaningful and add value to your life, there might be something worth holding onto. However, if the interactions feel one-sided or if you often feel drained after trying to engage, it might be a sign that the friendship is no longer serving you positively. # Open Communication Before making any decisions, try to have an open and honest conversation with your friend about your feelings. Express that you’ve noticed a change in the dynamic of your friendship and that you miss the closeness you once shared. Their response can give you insight into their feelings and help you decide the best course of action. Sometimes, friends are not aware of their behavior until it’s brought to their attention. # Assess the Effort Balance Friendships should ideally be a two-way street, with both parties making an effort to maintain the connection. Continuously being the only one to initiate contact can be exhausting and can also lead to feelings of resentment. If, after discussing your feelings, there’s still no effort made on their part, it might be an indicator that the friendship does not hold the same value for them as it does for you. # Consider Life Circumstances Sometimes, a friend\'s lack of initiative isn’t about their feelings toward you but rather a reflection of their current life circumstances. They might be going through personal challenges, stress, or life changes that you\'re unaware of. Taking these factors into account can offer a more compassionate perspective and might influence your decision on whether to hold on a little longer. # Give Space Giving your friend some space can sometimes help. It removes the pressure from both of you and can provide an opportunity to miss each other\'s company. If the friendship is genuinely valued, space might rekindle your friend\'s interest in maintaining the connection. # Prioritize Mutual Connections Friendships ideally should involve mutual respect, effort, and enjoyment. If these elements are consistently absent, it might be healthier to let go and focus on relationships that offer more reciprocity. It’s important to surround yourself with people who make you feel valued and appreciated. # Moving Forward If you decide to let go, try to do so with grace and gratitude for the good times you shared. Sometimes, releasing the expectation of what a friendship should look like allows it to evolve into something new that can still be meaningful, even if it’s not as close as before. # Self-Care Regardless of the outcome, make sure to take care of yourself emotionally. Engage in activities that you enjoy, and seek support from other friends or loved ones. Remember that it\'s okay to grieve the loss of a friendship; it\'s a significant part of one\'s life and personal history. The decision to hold on or let go of a fading friendship is deeply personal and can be very challenging. It’s worth remembering, though, that friendships, like all relationships, can ebb and flow over time. Some may rekindle and grow stronger after a period of distance, while others may naturally come to an end, making space for new connections that enrich your life in different ways."},{"prompt":"Yea, I\'ll give an example: knew a guy 7 years ago and had constant contact w/ hm for 4. After he moved out it got less, but I always initiated w/ him and tried to help and advise him. He never initiated but did respond to me like he was fiting in well and has a whole bunch of new friends and our last conversations was about him finding a girl friend. It kinda felt more focused on him and so I never initiated another message and he never did either. This was all 2 years ago","completion":"The experience you\'ve shared is a poignant example of how friendships can evolve and sometimes drift apart over time, especially when significant life changes occur, such as moving away. It\'s clear that this friendship held significance for you, given your efforts to maintain contact and provide support and advice over the years. The transition you\'ve described, where conversations became less frequent and more focused on his new life and experiences, signals a natural shift in his attention and possibly his needs from the friendship. It\'s not uncommon for people to become more immersed in their immediate environment and new social circles after a move, which can lead to a decrease in the intensity or frequency of contact with friends from their past. Your decision to stop initiating contact after feeling that the conversations had become one-sided reflects a self-protective step and a response to the lack of reciprocal effort. It\'s a valid and understandable reaction to a situation where you felt your efforts were not being matched, and it highlights the importance of mutual engagement in maintaining a friendship. # Reflecting on Your Experience 1. **Acknowledging Your Feelings**: It\'s essential to acknowledge and process any feelings of loss, disappointment, or sadness you may have regarding the drift in your friendship. These feelings are valid, and addressing them is a crucial part of moving forward. 2. **Valuing the Friendship for What It Was**: Try to remember the positive aspects of your friendship and the good times you shared. Sometimes, friendships serve a particular purpose at a certain stage of our lives but may not be destined to last forever in the same capacity. 3. **Open to Reconnection**: The future can be unpredictable. Sometimes, friendships can be rekindled after a period of distance, especially if the foundation was strong. Being open to this possibility, without overly dwelling on it, can be a balanced approach. 4. **Focusing on Reciprocal Relationships**: Use this experience as a learning opportunity to focus on relationships that offer a more balanced exchange of support, effort, and interest. Cultivating friendships where there\'s mutual engagement can lead to more fulfilling connections. 5. **Self-Growth and Moving Forward**: Your proactive approach in attempting to maintain the friendship speaks to your capacity for loyalty and support. Moving forward, you can apply these valuable qualities to new and existing relationships that offer the reciprocity you deserve. It\'s worth noting that it\'s okay to reach out if you ever feel the desire to reconnect or if you find yourself curious about his life. Sometimes, a message after a significant period of silence can reopen lines of communication, though it\'s also important to manage your expectations about the outcome. Remember, the ebb and flow of friendships are a natural part of life. Each relationship, regardless of its duration, contributes to our growth and understanding of what we seek in connections with others."},{"prompt":"I get it, it just made me melancholic and somewhat jelous of people that have life long friendships","completion":"Feeling melancholic and experiencing envy towards those with long-term friendships are genuine reactions to reflecting on your own experiences of friendships that have drifted apart. These feelings underscore a deep appreciation for the value of close, enduring connections. It’s important to recognize and validate these emotions while also considering ways to navigate and learn from them: # 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings** Allow yourself space to feel melancholic or envious without self-judgment. These emotions are part of the human experience and can provide insight into what we deeply desire or value in our lives. # 2. **Redefine Friendship** Understand that friendships come in many forms and can vary greatly in terms of depth and duration. Some friendships are meant to last a lifetime, while others may be significant but transient. Both types have value and contribute to our growth and happiness. Focusing on the quality of connections rather than their longevity might offer a new perspective. # 3. **Cultivate New Connections** It’s never too late to form new friendships that have the potential to last a lifetime. Engage in activities or communities where you can meet people who share your interests and values. Authentic connections can start at any age or stage of life. # 4. **Nurture Existing Relationships** Consider the relationships in your life that have the potential to grow deeper. Sometimes, existing acquaintances or newer friends can develop into close, lifelong connections with nurturing and effort from both sides. # 5. **Practice Gratitude** Reflect on the friendships and relationships you do have, focusing on the positives they bring to your life. Practicing gratitude can shift your focus from what is lacking to what is enriching and meaningful. # 6. **Self-Compassion and Patience** Building and maintaining lifelong friendships takes time, effort, and a bit of luck in finding the right people. Be patient with yourself and the process, and treat yourself with kindness and understanding as you navigate the complexities of human connections. # 7. **Learn from Envy** While envy is often viewed negatively, it can serve as a powerful motivator for change and self-reflection. If you admire the longevity and depth of others’ friendships, consider what actionable steps you could take to foster similar connections in your own life. # 8. **Seek Fulfillment Within** While friendships play a significant role in our lives, finding contentment and fulfillment within yourself creates a strong foundation for any relationship. Cultivating your interests, self-care, and personal growth can enhance your well-being and make you a more engaging and fulfilled friend. Remember, each person\'s journey with friendship is unique. The paths to forming and maintaining deep connections vary greatly and can be influenced by many factors. While it\'s natural to long for close, enduring friendships, it\'s also valuable to appreciate the relationships that come into our lives, however fleeting or long-lasting they may be."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

People with autism might also have unique strengths and differences. It\'s crucial to understand that autism is a spectrum, with individuals experiencing varied symptoms and levels of impairment or ability. If Alyx Vance were autistic, her communication style might reflect common characteristics seen among some individuals on the spectrum. For example, she might prefer direct, literal communication and possibly express difficulty understanding or using non-literal language like idioms or sarcasm. However, given Alyx’s established character as intelligent, resourceful, and empathetic, these traits could also mean she has developed strategies to navigate social interactions effectively. Her interests might be more intense, and she might display a high level of expertise in her special interests, such as hacking or mechanics, consistent with her role in the Half-Life series. 2. **Willebrand Syndrome (Von Willebrand Disease)**: It\'s essential to note that you might have meant Von Willebrand Disease, a genetic disorder that leads to bleeding problems. If Alyx Vance had Von Willebrand Disease, she would have a bleeding disorder that could make her bruise easily and bleed for longer than normal. This condition wouldn\'t directly affect her speech but could impact her physical activities and require her to take precautions to prevent significant blood loss from injuries. Incorporating both Autism and Von Willebrand Disease into Alyx Vance\'s character would introduce significant complexities to her role in the game. From a gameplay and storytelling perspective, developers would need to consider how these aspects of her character might influence her interactions, physical abilities, and the strategies players use. Providing Alyx with these conditions could offer a more diverse representation in video games, though it\'s vital such portrayals are handled with care, accuracy, and the input of individuals who have firsthand experience with the conditions represented. In terms of how Alyx would speak, if focusing solely on the impact of autism on communication, she might have a more methodical or precise way of expressing herself, potentially avoiding ambiguous expressions. Her speech patterns might include specific interests, expertise in her favorite subjects, and a directness that is often seen as a hallmark of communication for many individuals on the autism spectrum. However, these characteristics could vary widely between individuals. Any changes in a beloved character like Alyx Vance would need to be undertaken thoughtfully, considering the diversity of experiences among people with autism and those living with Von Willebrand Disease, to avoid stereotypes and ensure a representation that is both respectful and empowering."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Rehydrating dried fruit is a process that puts moisture back into the fruit, making it plumper, softer, and in some cases, more flavorful. This can be particularly useful in cooking and baking when you want to add moisture and enhance the texture and flavor of your recipes. Here’s a simple method to rehydrate sultanas, raisins, or similar dried fruits: 1. **Warm Water Method**: - Place the raisins or sultanas in a bowl. - Cover them with hot, but not boiling, water. Hot tap water is usually sufficient. - Let them soak for about 15-30 minutes. If you\'re not in a hurry, you can also use lukewarm water and let them soak for a couple of hours or overnight. - Drain the water from the bowl. If desired, you can gently pat the fruit dry with a paper towel. 2. **Using Juices or Alcohol**: - For added flavor, instead of water, you can rehydrate the dried fruits in fruit juices like apple or orange juice, or even in alcohol such as brandy, rum, or whisky. This is especially popular when preparing fruits for baking or cooking. - Follow the same steps as above, but replace water with your liquid of choice. 3. **Steaming**: - Another method is to steam the dried fruits for a few minutes. This gentle process of heating will also rehydrate the fruit without the need for soaking. 4. **Microwave Method**: - You can also use the microwave to speed up the process. Place the fruits in a microwave-safe bowl, cover them with water, and use your microwave\'s defrost setting or low power for short intervals of 10-20 seconds, checking and stirring in between until they are rehydrated. Be careful not to cook them. **Tips**: - Ensure not to soak or heat the fruits for too long, as this might turn them into mush, particularly if using a microwave. - After rehydrating, if the fruits are used for baking, you may reduce the liquid amount in your recipe slightly to compensate for the additional moisture introduced by the rehydrated fruits. Rehydrated fruits are excellent in baked goods, cereals, salads, or even as a snack, depending on how they were rehydrated and your personal preference."},{"prompt":"Could this be a possible options to prepare fruits for the process of wine making? If so, which of the discussed methods, if any, might produce better results.","completion":"Yes, rehydrating dried fruits can indeed be a step in preparing fruits for winemaking, especially when fresh fruits are not available or when a winemaker wishes to introduce unique flavors that dried fruits can offer. For winemaking, the goal is typically to extract as much flavor and sugar as possible from the fruits, as these components are crucial for fermentation. When considering the methods of rehydration for winemaking purposes, a few points are worth considering: 1. **Warm Water Method**: - Soaking dried fruits in warm water is a straightforward approach that can work well for winemaking. This method helps to plump up the fruits, making it easier to extract flavors and sugars. It’s a clean and simple method, without introducing additional flavors that could complicate the wine\'s profile. 2. **Using Juices or Alcohol**: - Rehydrating dried fruits in fruit juices or alcohol can introduce interesting flavors and complexities into the wine. For example, soaking raisins in grape juice could enhance the grapey flavor of the wine, while using spirits like brandy could introduce unique notes. However, it’s important to consider how these additional flavors will blend with the overall taste profile of the wine. In the context of winemaking, the amount of alcohol or juice used for rehydration is minimal compared to the total volume, but it can still impact the final product. 3. **Steaming** and **Microwave Method**: - These methods are less commonly used in winemaking preparation, primarily because they involve heat, which could potentially alter the natural flavors of the fruits. For winemaking, preserving the natural characteristics of the fruits is usually preferred. **Best Practice for Winemaking**: - The warm water method is often the most suitable for winemaking due to its simplicity and effectiveness in rehydrating the fruits without altering their natural flavors. - If experimenting with juices or alcohol, it’s essential to do so with an understanding of how these additional flavors will integrate into the wine. This can be an area for creativity and unique winemaking. **Additional Steps**: - After rehydrating, you may wish to crush or chop the fruits to increase the surface area for better extraction of flavors and sugars. - Sanitation is crucial in all steps of winemaking, so ensure that any method of rehydration also considers cleanliness to avoid introducing unwanted bacteria or yeasts. Overall, while rehydrating dried fruits for winemaking, the focus is on maximizing flavor and sugar extraction in a controlled, sanitary manner that complements the intended profile of the wine."},{"prompt":"Do you know what kind of grapes are commonly used for the production of sultanas and whether these would typically produce a good wine?","completion":"Sultanas, also known as Thompson Seedless in the United States, are made from small, sweet white seedless grapes. The Thompson Seedless grape variety is the most common type used for producing sultanas. These grapes are not only used for drying into raisins and sultanas but also consumed fresh and utilized in the production of grape juice. They are known for their light green color and sweet flavor. In the context of winemaking, Thompson Seedless grapes are generally not the preferred choice for producing fine wines. This is mainly because the characteristics that make a grape variety suitable for winemaking—such as acidity, skin thickness, tannin content, and flavor complexity—differ from those desirable in table grapes or grapes used for drying. Thompson Seedless grapes have a relatively neutral flavor profile and low acidity, which can result in wines lacking in character and complexity. Thus, while it is technically possible to make wine from Thompson Seedless grapes, they are not typically used for high-quality or varietal wine production. Wine grapes are usually selected from varieties that have been specifically cultivated for their ability to produce complex, balanced wines with good aging potential. Some of the most well-known wine grape varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon Blanc, among many others. These varieties are chosen for their distinctive flavors, aromas, and ability to express the terroir in which they are grown. However, it is worth noting that many types of fruits, including various grape varieties not traditionally used for winemaking, can be and are used to make wines at home or by experimental winemakers. While these wines might not fit the traditional or commercial profile of fine wine, they can still provide enjoyable and unique experiences for those who appreciate the diversity of flavors and the process of winemaking itself. Experimentation with less conventional grape varieties, including Thompson Seedless grapes, can lead to interesting and enjoyable wines, even if they do not adhere to conventional wine standards."},{"prompt":"If I were to attempt to used sultanas or raisins from Thompson Seedless grapes as part of a wine making recipe, are you aware of any additives or processing techniques that may improve the outcome and produce a wine that is closer to the more traditional wines produced with the varieties you mentioned?","completion":"Using sultanas or raisins from Thompson Seedless grapes in winemaking can indeed create a unique wine, but since these grapes have a neutral flavor profile and lower acidity, there are several techniques and additives that can help enhance the outcome, bringing it closer to traditional wine styles. Here are some suggestions: # 1. **Acid Adjustment** - To balance the wine and add brightness, you might need to adjust the acidity. Tartaric acid is the most commonly used acid in winemaking for this purpose. You can also use citric acid, but tartaric is preferred for its stability in wine. # 2. **Tannin Addition** - Tannins contribute to the structure and mouthfeel of wine, characteristics that might be lacking in wines made from sultanas or raisins. You can add grape tannin powders available from winemaking supply stores to achieve this effect. # 3. **Yeast Selection** - The choice of yeast can significantly impact the flavor profile of the wine. Select a yeast strain that enhances the characteristics you desire in your wine. Some yeast strains can bring out fruitier profiles, while others can contribute to body and complexity. # 4. **Oak Aging or Oak Additives** - Using oak chips or oak barrels (if available) during fermentation or aging can introduce additional complexity, flavors, and aromas such as vanilla, toast, and spice, which are characteristic of many traditional wines. # 5. **Sugar Adjustment** - Since raisins and sultanas are dried and have concentrated sugars, the potential alcohol level must be carefully managed. You might need to adjust the sugar content by diluting the must (the grape juice mixture before and during fermentation) to achieve a balanced wine. Too much sugar can lead to an overly alcoholic wine or fermentation problems. # 6. **Nutrient Additions** - Fermentation nutrients, particularly nitrogen in the form of DAP (diammonium phosphate), can help ensure a healthy fermentation, especially since the nutrient composition of a must made from dried fruits might not be ideal for yeast health. # 7. **Hydration and Reconstitution** - Before fermentation, properly rehydrate the sultanas or raisins in water. This isn\'t just about adding water; it\'s about allowing the dried fruits to absorb moisture and plump up, which can help in extracting more flavors and sugars. Consider using warm water to help in this process and maybe even a small amount of wine-friendly enzyme to aid in breaking down the fruit structure for better flavor extraction. # 8. **Blending** - After fermentation, consider blending your raisin wine with wine made from traditional wine grapes. This can help adjust the flavor, acidity, and body, making the final product more complex and closer to conventional wines. # Experimentation and Record-Keeping - Making wine from non-traditional ingredients like sultanas or raisins involves a lot of experimentation. Keeping detailed records of your process and adjustments will help you refine your technique over time. Remember, winemaking is as much an art as it is science. Don\'t be afraid to experiment and adjust based on what you taste. What might begin as a curiosity about using alternative ingredients could end up as a fascinating and enjoyable winemaking journey."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Keep in mind, interpretations and portrayals need to be handled sensitively and accurately to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or misconceptions. Here\'s how such a portrayal could influence various aspects: 1. **Representation**: Incorporating a character with autism, especially a well-rounded, capable, and integral character like Alyx Vance, can contribute positively towards autism representation in media. It can challenge prevailing stereotypes and myths about autism, showcasing a more nuanced, realistic depiction that highlights the diversity within the autism spectrum. 2. **Empathy and Understanding**: Players often feel a strong emotional connection with characters in video games due to the interactive and immersive nature of the medium. Having Alyx Vance portrayed as autistic could help players without autism develop a better understanding of and empathy for autistic individuals. It can serve as a bridge to educate players about autism in a natural and engaging context. 3. **Role Model and Identification**: For autistic players, having a character like Alyx Vance depicted as sharing their neurotype can be incredibly validating. It provides a much-needed role model in popular culture that autistic individuals can identify with, potentially improving self-esteem and the feeling of being represented in media narratives. 4. **Gameplay and Storytelling Innovation**: Incorporating Alyx\'s autism into the game could lead to innovative gameplay mechanics and narrative depth. For instance, her unique way of interacting with the world and solving problems could be reflected in gameplay, offering new kinds of puzzles or challenges that leverage her strengths. Storylines could intelligently integrate her experiences and perspective, enriching the game\'s world and emotional impact. 5. **Challenges**: It’s crucial that such a portrayal avoids reducing Alyx to just her autism. She is a beloved character because of her complexity, strengths, and vulnerabilities. Additionally, the representation should be well-researched and crafted with input from the autistic community to avoid reinforcing negative stereotypes or inaccuracies. In conclusion, portraying Alyx Vance as autistic could have profound and positive implications if done respectfully and accurately. It would reflect the diversity of human experiences, promote inclusivity, and potentially lead to richer, more engaging game narratives and mechanics. This approach also aligns with a broader push for diversity and representation in media, contributing to a more inclusive entertainment landscape."},{"prompt":"Write voice lines of her speaking with Gordon.","completion":"Imagining Alyx Vance as an autistic character might influence her dialogue subtly, reflecting her unique perspective and communication style while maintaining her intelligence, resourcefulness, and empathy.

Exacerbations remain despite maintenance therapies, which diminish physical activity, quality of life, and increase death risk in severe patients, making exacerbation prediction crucial. Biosensor technology must be leveraged creatively to develop a home COPD exacerbation detection system using patients’ saliva. Healthcare need and impact COPD is a severe public health issue due to its rising social impact (Yoshimatsu et al., 2019) and its status as the 3rd greatest cause of mortality (Lozano et al., 2012) and morbidity worldwide (Dong et al., 2020). It is an inflammatory reaction to environmental stress and tobacco smoking, 44 million people have been diagnosed and 160 million are unconfirmed cases (Fletcher et al., 2011). COPD has considerable economic effects in many developed and developing nations (Foo et al., 2016). Due to poor diagnosis and follow-up, developing nations have more occurrences of this disease (Vogelmeier et al., 2017; Hyrkäs-Palmu, 2018). COPD is one of the costliest health conditions in terms of direct (healthcare and medical) and indirect (home and work productivity) expenses, largely due to acute exacerbation hospitalisations as the gold standard equipment cannot anticipate them. The UK has over 6 million COPD sufferers, significantly impacting health care and society. COPD causes 24 million lost working days and 23,000 deaths annually, resulting in about £4 billion in lost productivity. Although COPD is stable, abrupt exacerbations aggravate the patient\'s condition. Recent proteomics study suggests saliva protein biomarkers can improve diagnosis and exacerbation forecasts. There is a lack of plain, simple, accurate diagnostic procedures for diagnosing exacerbation of COPD utilising a patient\'s saliva. The project will involve developing a product incorporating a biosensor for a system for detecting COPD exacerbations which will go a long way in improving physical wellbeing as well as identifying and handling acute exacerbations in patient care, may improve medical associated lifestyle according to (Zwerink et al., 2014; Bischoff et al., 2012). National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, 2010) advises self-monitoring to be used in patient care. Innovation Traditional COPD diagnosis methods are expensive, time-consuming, and lack sensitivity and selectivity, necessitating the development of new techniques. Biosensors offer unparalleled potential for cost-effective diagnosis of COPD (Huang et al., 2019). Currently, there is a need to create efficient, accurate and readily available health monitoring systems for assessing the health condition of patients with COPD. A portable, low-cost, easy-to-use, and fast analysis tool for COPD patients to self-manage and detect acute exacerbations is proposed. The design objective is to create a portable electrochemical biosensor that can accurately and quickly detect exacerbation of COPD by analysing a patient\'s saliva. This biosensor will provide real-time data, extremely sensitive, selective, and reproducible, making it an effective diagnostic tool. Typically, the technology can handle small quantities of samples, which are usually not difficult for most patients to provide. This is important because it is now commonly recognised that frequently assessing symptoms is necessary for classifying and predicting COPD (Vestbo et al., 2013). The diagnostic approach relies on a biosensor that utilises a combination of many biomarkers to enhance the accuracy of diagnosing and predicting the outcome of COPD. The advanced biosensor will have the ability to rapidly analyse patient saliva and accurately assess the patient\'s condition. Many COPD exacerbation-detecting technologies exist. Spirometry, the primary and secondary care standard, has low accuracy, limited outcome prediction, and requires specialised operators for evaluation. Device quality, leaks, and patient condition may distort results (Dong et al.,2020). Yee et al. 2017 developed a colourimetric immunoassay to detect MMP-8 and MMP-9 in periodontal disease saliva. The sample was dropped on the biosensing zone for luminous biomarker concentration evaluation after antibodies were injected in a controlled flow. Using a microscope to measure made it inappropriate for home care. Fluorescence-based LoC biosensors measure salivary IL-8 and MMP-9 (Nie et al., 2014). The measurements required a 20 µL sample volume and yielded results in 70 minutes. Its small sample size makes it comfortable for patients to use every day, but its lengthy and difficult technique limits homecare use. Technical approach The project aims to develop a diagnostic system involving a novel biosensor design to be used in the home for detecting exacerbation of COPD using biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) from the saliva of a patient. The project begins by identifying the need for simple, reliable, accurate, accurate and readily available COPD patients’ health monitoring tools, especially during home exacerbations. After determining the goal, biosensors are developed to detect and characterise biological targets using biochemical reactions or biomarkers like CRP and PCT. CRP and PCT, saliva levels in COPD patients were evaluated as another possible testing sample to blood. According to Patel et al. (2014). C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) levels provide clinically useful information on disease status. Using many biomarkers to reliably predict COPD exacerbation will create a sensitive biosensor. A handheld gadget that measures COPD patients\' saliva for diagnosis will be created by integrating this sensor. The main objectives: Assess the diagnostic solutions that are most suitable for the goal of diagnosing COPD excerbations. Review essential technologies to develop a diagnostic system for COPD, including salivary biomarkers related to COPD exacerbation. Determine the panel of salivary protein biomarkers that signifies the onset and exacerbation of COPD. Establish the fundamental basis for the creation of biosensors and the corresponding methodology. Develop an electrochemical biosensor to detect C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) as COPD biomarkers in saliva. Clinical testing and performance evaluations A biosensor designed for protein detection consists of three fundamental components: a bioreceptor, which is a biological recognition element that specifically reacts to one or more target analytes; a transducer, which generates a quantifiable signal when bio-recognition events occur; and a signal processor, which gathers, enhances, and presents the signal. Electrochemical transducers are biosensors\' main biosensing components (Barhoumi et al., 2018). Exploitation There is a high probability that sales of self-care products for respiratory illnesses will increase in the UK. As the world becomes more connected, individuals with various health conditions are taking charge of their conditions with expert guidance and peer support in the community and online. The yearly economic burden of COPD on the NHS is approximated at £1.9 billion respectively. The UK has over 6 million COPD sufferers, significantly impacting health care and society. COPD results in a total of 24 million working days being lost each year, resulting in about £4 billion in lost productivity. The human cost of COPD is significant, about 50% of COPD patients are unaware of their diagnosis, with 23,000 deaths annually, or one every 20 minutes. A significant amount of COPD costs is spent on managing patients in acute exacerbations as inpatients. The primary market for the product is COPD patients in the UK, Europe, and North America due to higher healthcare spending and well-developed healthcare infrastructure. The product market is expected to expand globally as COPD levels rise due to global air pollution and lifestyle changes. The Asia-Pacific region: China, India, and Japan, market is expected to develop rapidly due to rising air pollution, these regions are predicted to experience the greatest growth in respiratory ailments. Pre-market capitalization is a helpful tool for obtaining insights, data, and projections that are essential for developing corporate strategies, capitalising on market possibilities, evaluating risks, establishing goals, identifying trends, and comprehending target customers. Assessing recent technologies, target market regulations, market investment, pipeline products, political and economic factors that could impact market growth, using tools such as opportunity map analysis, market attractiveness index, PORTER\'s five forces analysis, drivers and restraints impact analysis, and PESTLE Analysis, will aid in determining the appropriate price for the target market.

My CW2 is below: Introduction In vitro diagnostic (IVD) tools are devices utilised outside the human body to analyse human samples (such as body fluids, tissue samples and cells) to detect diseases or assess organ function (Wang et al., 2023). The objective of the project is to create a diagnostic system that uses an innovative biosensor design. The device will be used in a home setting to detect the excerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by analysing the biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) present in a patient\'s saliva. Regulatory requirements IVD, also known as the \\"doctor\'s eyes\\", are essential for modern laboratory medicine (Müller et al., 2022). IVD includes laboratory-based and point-of-care testing (Apacmed, 2022). The device is a Portable electrochemical biosensor with high sensitivity, precision, and consistency enabling it to generate real-time data, making it an efficient diagnostic tool. The Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) classifies the product as an in-vitro diagnostic medical device (IVD) based on risk. Classification regulation requires class three IVDs to test for biomarkers, antigens, or antibodies. The device is a class three IVD in terms of use and risk. It is a self-testing device which makes it a high risk IVD. To gauge the severity of COPD exacerbation, the device is engineered to detect biomarkers. There are fundamental characteristics that serve as guides for identifying IVDs. Self-testing IVD devices are designed for laypeople to collect data independently following manufacturer instructions (IMDRF, 2021). The public\'s safety must be considered before medical equipment, which are powerful, are distributed. Regulatory bodies must control the distribution of such device. Regulatory permission for the IVD\'s dissemination to the public is contingent upon the following ISO standards being reviewed. ISO 14971: Medical device companies worldwide must follow ISO risk management standards, which focus on the international community. ISO 10993: This standard underpins medical device biocompatibility testing, including IVDs. When evaluating IVD biomarkers, ISO 10993 criteria must be followed to protect patients from hazards. The following countries are where I will be seeking approval for the IVD. The United States of America The United Kingdom China Japan The FDA and MHRA oversee US and UK medical devices. The FDA oversees commercial laboratory medical test system safety and efficacy. The FDA prioritises patient-safety-risky devices to maximise resource use (Mansfield et al., 2005). The MHRA oversees medicines, devices, and blood products in the UK to safeguard public health and advance science. They have aligned requirements and regulatory procedures, resulting in a similar approval process for medical devices in both countries. However, depending on the risk of the device, the quantity and quality of clinical data required to obtain market approval differs in each country (Fink and Akra, 2023). US-approved medical devices merely require basic post-market surveillance, UK (EU) producers must regularly collect clinical data and submit particular reports to right agencies (Fink and Akra, 2023). Collecting evidence: Obtaining regulatory clearance for the technology requires proof that it is effective, produces reliable outcomes, and poses no risk to patients\' lives. Further, there is need to show that patients can operate the gadget properly even when not being supervised by a doctor. Laboratory trials are planned and approved before being carried out. The results of these trials are used in clinical care. Analyte-specific reagents (ASRs) from the laboratory or a different manufacturer are used in laboratory studies (Mansfield et al., 2005). No medical device can be developed without first completing the necessary laboratory and clinical testing. The process involved in a laboratory trial include the following, Selecting Appropriate test: This process aims to get the best approach to the test for maximum effectiveness of the product. Obtaining the specimen: For a laboratory test to be effective, the specimen must include the right biomarkers to ensure the result is reliable, accurate, and gives the desired result. Experimental/testing Phase: This phase entails the carrying out of laboratory procedures on the chosen specimen. Interpreting of results: In this step, the experiment results are carefully examined to determine if they meet the requirements and if the process is ready for the Clinical Trial. Post analytical phase. When laboratory experiments show promise, the Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) reviews and approves them. Once the MHRA approves all safety measures, clinical trials can begin. The clinical trial will be divided into three phases: Phase 1 trial: Data on patients\' response to the device is the main focus of this phase. Its sample size is modest. In this phase, the device\'s use and patients\' responses will be monitored. This phase primarily aims to gather data on patients\' response to the device. It is characterised by a relatively small sample size. During this phase, the device\'s application will be observed, and observe patients\' responses to it. Phase 2 trial: This requires a larger sample than phase 1 trial. This phase determines the optimal device application method and assesses any potential side effects. Phase 3 trial: This step involves mitigating any adverse effects of using the technology. The necessary physical resources include patient samples, manufacturing materials, and technicians throughout the invention process. Evidence will be collected on the COPD device\'s diagnosis accuracy and functionality. Clinical trials involve volunteers who help us understand health and medicine, unlike laboratory investigations. Differences between the laboratory and clinical trials CLINICAL TRIAL LABORATORY TRIAL Definition Entails the examination of the safety and efficacy of medical therapies in human subjects. Entails research inside a controlled laboratory environment to comprehend biological mechanisms. Setting Clinical settings, such as hospitals Laboratory environment Subjects Individuals who volunteer to take part in the trial Make use of Cell cultures, animals, and tissues besides humans Methods Case series, Randomized controlled trials, observational studies In vivo and in vitro experiments Outcome Improved medical interventions for human health Understanding of biological processes Example Studying the safety and effectiveness of a new drug in humans Investigating the mechanisms of a disease in a cell culture Fund raising For innovative ideas to make an impact in healthcare, it must first be adopted and supported. Also, before a new medical product can be used on a patient, it must be proven safe and secure in providing solution to a medical problem. Innovators must proof the efficiency of their product before taking it to the market. The scope of this project can be funded by government grants, business partnerships, or venture capital. However, this initiative will be funded by government funds from relevant organisations that fund medical product research and development. The device\'s development, regulatory compliance, clinical trials, manufacture, marketing, distribution, regulatory clearance, and postproduction surveillance is estimated to be about 25–30 million dollars. Some organisations, like the National Institute for Care and Research (NIHR), provide research grants and financing to inventive researchers who want to solve critical health issues. The FDA offers competitive grants to individuals and qualifying organisations for research and product development. NIHR Funding Advantages Disadvantages Provides great Financial Support Highly competitive funding process Provides Access to state-of-the-art facilities and infrastructure Strict rules and regulations guiding the funding process Provides credibility for the product Lengthy approval procedure Opportunity to collaborate with other researchers High level of research constraint FDA Funding Advantages Disadvantages Improved chances of regulatory approval success Possibility of limited funding sources Provides product with credibility boost Strict rules and regulations guiding the funding procedure Access to regulatory experts Grants is highly competitive High networking opportunity Long approval process The breakdown of the commercialization process can be divided into three major parts which include the innovation phase, the clinical phase and the regulatory clearance phase. The estimated price for the innovation phase can be approximately 5 million dollars. The clinical phase estimate at approximately 9 to 10 million dollars. The regulatory clearance phases up to the post market surveillance will amount for the rest of the budget as well as the miscellaneous. The Innovation stage can take about 1- 2 years same as the regulatory and production stages.

What could the migration user journeys be? So far I have: Migrating Existing Users with SSO Migrating Users to Native Auth0 Authentication Onboarding New Users with Access to Multiple Products Integrating Multiple IdPs for a Seamless User Experience Transitioning Users from Deprecated IdPs Any other scenarios?","completion":"Your current list of user migration journeys covers many of the typical scenarios encountered when migrating users to a new Identity Provider (IdP). Below are additional scenarios that you might consider, based on various organizational, technical, and user experience needs: 1. **Bulk Migration with Minimal User Interruption**: Planning a migration strategy that moves user accounts in bulk, possibly through automated scripts or tools provided by the new IdP, designed to minimize any disruption or required action from end users. This might involve pre-migrating data and then having a quick cutover where users might only need to reset their passwords. 2. **Phased Migration Based on User Groups or Roles**: Implementing a phased migration where users are migrated in groups based on certain criteria such as their role, department, location, or usage patterns. This allows for a more controlled migration process and the ability to address issues on a smaller scale before they affect the entire user base. 3. **Self-Service Migration for Users**: Creating a self-service portal or mechanism where users are informed of the migration (via email or upon login) and can initiate the migration process themselves at their convenience. This can include verifying their identity, consenting to the migration, and setting up new authentication factors if required. 4. **Re-authentication Post-migration**: Designing a process for re-authenticating users post-migration to ensure that their first login experience with the new IdP is secure. This might include multi-factor authentication (MFA) setup or re-confirmation of email and/or phone number. 5. **Migrating Users with Conditional Access Policies**: If your organization uses conditional access policies to enforce security, you\'ll need a strategy to migrate these policies and ensure they are applied correctly in the new IdP environment. This may involve mapping old policies to new ones or creating new policy definitions that align with the new IdP\'s capabilities. 6. **Hybrid Migration for Coexistence**: In scenarios where you cannot migrate all users or services at once, establishing a hybrid model where the old and new IdP coexist. This requires setting up trust relationships and federation between the two IdPs to ensure a seamless authentication experience for users. 7. **Migrating Users with Custom Authentication Flows**: If your current system involves complex or custom authentication flows (e.g., custom MFA, bespoke integration with legacy systems), creating a detailed migration plan to replicate or replace these flows in the new IdP will be crucial. 8. **Post-Migration Cleanup and Decommissioning Strategy**: Finally, planning for the eventual decommissioning of the old IdP, including data cleanup, revoking old credentials, and removing integration points. This ensures security isn\'t compromised by orphaned accounts or outdated configurations lingering after the migration. Each of these scenarios involves its own set of challenges and will require careful planning, clear communication with stakeholders, and thorough testing to ensure a smooth transition for all users involved."},{"prompt":"I m referring to the various scenarios where they could be existing IdP, federated user, non federated user, active directory user, etc. Pls list down all possible scenarios for migrating to new IdP?","completion":"Migrating users to a new Identity Provider (IdP) can encompass a wide variety of scenarios, each with its unique challenges and considerations. Here are some comprehensive scenarios that take into account different types of user accounts, authentication methods, and organizational contexts: 1. **Existing IdP Users**: This involves users who are already authenticated through an existing IdP. The migration strategy may depend on the compatibility and federation capabilities between the old and new IdP systems. Strategies can include direct migration of user databases, using SAML/OIDC for federation during a transition period, or requiring users to re-register. 2. **Federated Users**: Users authenticated through federated authentication (e.g., via SAML or OpenID Connect) from various external organizations or partners. Migration strategies include updating federation configurations, ensuring claims and attributes are correctly mapped in the new IdP, and coordinating with federated partners for a smooth transition. 3. **Non-Federated Users**: Users with accounts directly on the system without using external IdP services. For these users, migrating credentials securely is critical, which might involve password reset flows, migrating hashed passwords (if security policies allow), or transitioning these users to federated authentication where possible. 4. **Active Directory Users**: Users authenticated via Active Directory (AD). Migration often involves integrating the new IdP with AD using protocols like LDAP or using directory synchronization tools if the new IdP supports it. Special consideration should be given to maintaining group memberships, roles, and permissions continuity. 5. **Social IdP Users**: Users who log in using social IdPs (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter). Migrating these users generally involves re-configuring the social login integrations in the new IdP and ensuring that user identifiers from social IdPs are correctly matched or linked to the existing user accounts. 6. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Users**: Users who are enrolled in MFA. Migration strategies must include the transfer of MFA settings or re-enrollment into MFA on the new platform, ensuring a seamless transfer of users\' MFA devices or methods. 7. **SaaS Application Users**: Users who access various Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. Migrating these users often requires updating SSO configurations in each application to point to the new IdP, testing to verify SSO works as expected, and coordinating the cutover to minimize disruption. 8. **API Consumers**: Applications or services that rely on the old IdP for API security via tokens. Migration strategies involve updating API clients with new endpoints and authentication methods provided by the new IdP, along with possible changes in scope and permission models. 9. **Legacy System Users**: Users who access older or proprietary systems that might not support modern authentication protocols. This scenario could require developing custom authentication solutions or employing bridge solutions that connect the legacy systems to the new IdP. 10. **Users with Custom Authentication Flows**: Custom flows might include step-up authentication, adaptive or risk-based authentication, or custom MFA challenges. Replicating these flows in the new IdP may involve using its extensibility features, such as hooks, scripts, or APIs to customize authentication and authorization processes. Each of these scenarios requires a tailored approach, detailed planning, and a focus on security, user experience, and minimizing disruption to services. Coordination with stakeholders, thorough testing, and clear communication with affected users are key to a successful migration."},{"prompt":"How does User Sync affect this? Could there be scenario where user sync is not required where some require user sync?","completion":"User synchronization (User Sync) plays a crucial role in the process of migrating users to a new Identity Provider (IdP) and in the ongoing management of user identities and access controls across systems. User Sync is the process of ensuring that user account information (such as usernames, email addresses, roles, and permissions) is consistent and up-to-date across different platforms and systems. The necessity and complexity of User Sync vary significantly depending on several factors, including the organization\'s architecture, the types of systems in use, and the specific user migration scenarios. Let\'s explore scenarios where User Sync might be required and others where it might not be: # Scenarios Where User Sync is Required 1. **Active Directory (AD) Integrated Environments**: In environments deeply integrated with Active Directory, User Sync is essential when migrating to a new IdP to ensure that user attributes and group memberships remain consistent between AD and the new IdP. 2. **Hybrid IdP Models**: Organizations transitioning from one IdP to another gradually may employ a hybrid model, where both IdPs are in use simultaneously. User Sync is critical here to ensure that changes in one system are reflected in the other, preventing discrepancies. 3. **Federated Identities**: For users who access resources across federated domains, maintaining synchronized user profiles ensures seamless access and a unified identity across systems. 4. **SaaS Application Users**: Enterprises using multiple SaaS applications need consistent user identities across these platforms. User Sync can automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of user accounts, roles, and permissions, based on the central identity store. 5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Users**: In scenarios where MFA settings or methods are included as user attributes, keeping this information synchronized across systems is important to ensure security measures are consistently applied. # Scenarios Where User Sync Might Not Be Required 1. **Self-Contained Single System Environments**: In situations where all user authentication and authorization occur within a single, standalone system without integration with other platforms or external resources, User Sync might not be necessary. Each user\'s information is managed individually within that system. 2. **Stateless API Authentication**: For applications using stateless authentication mechanisms (such as JWT tokens) and where user sessions are managed without the need for a persistent user store, User Sync might not be essential. 3. **Single Sign-On (SSO) Without Provisioning**: If the new IdP is used purely for SSO without the need for user provisioning or de-provisioning in various systems (e.g., all user management is done manually or through another process), the user sync process might be simplified or not needed. 4. **Social IdP Users**: Users logging in through social IdPs might not require user sync in scenarios where the application relies entirely on the social IdP for authentication and does not store user details or permissions. 5. **Temporary or Guest Access**: In cases where users are provided temporary or guest access without the need for deep integration into an organization’s systems, User Sync might not be required. In practice, the decision on whether User Sync is needed, and the complexity of its implementation, depends on the organization\'s specific requirements, the technologies in use, and the desired outcomes of the migration or integration process. Proper analysis and planning are needed to determine the best approach for handling user identities across systems."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Overwatch, developed by Blizzard Entertainment, is a team-based first-person shooter that emphasizes hero selection, teamwork, and objective-based gameplay. Each hero belongs to one of three roles: Damage, Tank, or Support, with each bringing unique abilities to the battlefield. Here\'s how a disguise device could impact the game: # Gameplay Impact 1. **Strategic Depth and Complexity**: A disguise device would add a new layer of strategy, allowing players to sneak behind enemy lines or feign retreats. Teams would need to adapt their strategies to account for potential disguised enemies, increasing the game\'s complexity. 2. **Increased Paranoia and Communication**: Teams would need to constantly communicate to verify allies\' identities, lest they fall prey to disguised enemies. This could lead to a more paranoid gameplay environment, with players second-guessing every encounter. 3. **Meta Shifts**: Certain heroes might become more or less valuable depending on how well they can exploit or counter disguises. Heroes with area-of-effect abilities or those that can reveal enemies, like Hanzo or Widowmaker with their respective recon abilities, could become crucial picks. # Potential Issues 1. **Balance Concerns**: Ensuring that the disguise device is balanced and doesn\'t favor any one class over others would be a significant challenge. It shouldn\'t make any hero too powerful or overshadow their inherent abilities. 2. **Game Pace Disruption**: Overwatch is known for its fast-paced action. A disguise device could potentially slow down the pace of the game, with teams being more cautious and spending more time verifying threats instead of engaging in combat. 3. **Player Frustration**: Being killed by a disguised enemy could be seen as unfair or frustrating, especially if there\'s a perception that skill was not a factor. Maintaining a sense of fair play and ensuring that skill remains a key component would be vital. # Implementation Considerations - **Limited Use**: To mitigate potential issues, the device could have limitations, such as a short duration, long cooldown, or being visible to enemies at close range. - **Visual/Audio Cues**: Implementing subtle visual or audio cues could help alert perceptive players to a disguise, maintaining a balance between deception and detectability. - **Role-Specific Limitations**: The device could have varying effects or limitations based on the user\'s role, ensuring that it complements but doesn\'t overpower their role\'s intended function. # Conclusion While a disguise device introduces exciting possibilities, its implementation would need to be carefully considered to maintain Overwatch\'s fast-paced gameplay, fairness, and the unique identity of each hero. Balancing such a device, ensuring it enhances the game without detracting from its core principles, would be crucial for its successful integration."},{"prompt":"I will give you a meeting minutes sample and from that sample you will be required for you to generate other minutes which resemble the one i have given it to you.

WORLD MEETING ROOM - DAY The room is bustling with noise as various nations gather, preparing for the day\'s discussions. The camera zooms in on AMERICA, who is sitting at his desk with a space shuttle toy, making whooshing noises as he pretends it\'s flying. ENGLAND, sitting nearby, looks over, annoyed. ENGLAND: (sighing) Must you always bring toys to these meetings, America? AMERICA: (smiling) Aw, come on, England! This isn\'t just any toy. It\'s a model of the Space Shuttle! And speaking of space, did I ever tell you guys about the time Big Bird almost went into space? The room grows quiet, nations turning their focus to America, curiosity piqued. FRANCE: (intrigued) Big Bird? As in, the character from your American children\'s television show? AMERICA: (nodding excitedly) Yup! The one and only! It’s a pretty wild story. The nations gather closer, even RUSSIA and CHINA showing interest. AMERICA: (beginning his tale) So, back in the 1980s, NASA wanted to get more people excited about space and the Space Shuttle missions. They figured, what better way to do that than by sending someone everyone loves into space? They thought of Big Bird from Sesame Street! ITALY: (clapping) Oh! I love Sesame Street! It\'s always so happy and fun. AMERICA: Yeah, it’s awesome! So, the plan was to send Big Bird— well, the man inside the suit, Caroll Spinney— into space on the Challenger shuttle. He was going to teach kids from space! GERMANY: (raising an eyebrow) That sounds... ambitious. What happened? AMERICA: (sighing) Well, there were a couple of problems. First, the Big Bird costume was huge! Too big for the shuttle. And then there were safety concerns. So, the idea was eventually scrapped. JAPAN: (thoughtfully) That is both interesting and somewhat sad. It would have been a unique way to inspire children. AMERICA: True, but the story doesn’t end there! Tragically, the Challenger Shuttle mission in 1986... it, uh, it didn’t go well. (He becomes somber) The room\'s atmosphere grows solemn, the nations sharing a moment of silence for the remembered disaster. ENGLAND: (softly) Yes, that was a dark day for all of us. It reminded us of the risks and sacrifices associated with space exploration. AMERICA: (nodding) Exactly. But it’s also why we’ve got to keep exploring and dreaming. Big Bird didn’t make it to space, but the spirit of exploration and teaching kids to dream big, that’s what’s important. FRANCE: (smiling) That is a very heartwarming perspective, America. Truly, it captures the resilient spirit of exploration. AMERICA: (brightening up) And who knows? Maybe one day, Big Bird or another beloved character will make it up there, to inspire the kids watching from Earth!

Similitudes: - Ambos relatos cuentan cómo el ser humano fue creado por una deidad: Marduk en el mito babilónico y Dios en el relato cristiano del Génesis. - En ambos casos, el ser humano es creado a partir de materiales terrenales: el barro en el mito de Marduk y el polvo de la tierra en el relato del Génesis. Diferencias: - En el mito de Marduk, el ser humano es creado como resultado de una lucha entre dioses y como un medio para servir a los dioses, mientras que en el relato del Génesis, el ser humano es creado por amor y para tener una relación íntima con Dios. - En el mito de Marduk, el ser humano es creado como un esclavo para trabajar en la construcción de la ciudad de Babilonia, mientras que en el relato del Génesis, el ser humano es creado para cuidar y gobernar la creación de Dios. - En el mito de Marduk, la creación del ser humano es un acto de violencia y dominio, mientras que en el relato del Génesis, la creación del ser humano es un acto de generosidad y amor divino. En resumen, mientras que ambos relatos hablan de la creación del ser humano por un ser superior a partir de materiales terrenales, el mito de Marduk muestra una visión más violenta y utilitaria de la creación, mientras que el relato cristiano del Génesis presenta una visión más amorosa y relacional."},{"prompt":"Is a group of robbers crashing while escaping from the police, and while running from the police, they encounter a mysterious creature in the woods be a good base plot for a thriller game?","completion":"Yes, the scenario you described can serve as an excellent base plot for a thriller game. It combines elements of crime, action, and horror/supernatural, making it ripe for intriguing gameplay and storytelling. Let\'s break down the elements and see how they could contribute to a compelling game: 1. **Robbery and Police Chase**: The game opens with a high-adrenaline scenario, instantly engaging players with a dramatic escape. This part of the plot can introduce players to the game\'s mechanics, controlling characters, and making quick decisions under pressure. It sets the stage for the tension and stakes involved. 2. **Crash and Isolation**: The transition from a high-speed chase to a crash adds a sudden twist, heightening the tension. This moment could serve as a crucial plot device that shifts the game\'s tone from a straightforward escape to survival. Being isolated, especially in an unfamiliar and possibly hostile environment, can introduce survival mechanics into the game—resource management, stealth, and exploring the surroundings for a way out or to communicate with the outside world. 3. **Encounter with a Mysterious Creature**: This introduces a completely new layer of intrigue and danger. It can be the central element that elevates the game from a standard crime thriller to a supernatural or horror thriller. The creature can serve multiple narrative and gameplay purposes: a constant threat that stalks the players, a mystery to unravel (origins, weaknesses, motives), or even a metaphorical or literal representation of the characters\' guilt and crimes. 4. **Character Development and Dynamics**: The group dynamics among the robbers can provide rich material for character development and storytelling. Their interactions, decisions, and conflicts, especially when under pressure from external threats (police and the creature), can reveal their backstories, motivations, and potentially lead to redemption arcs or tragic downfalls. 5. **Setting and Atmosphere**: The woods can be an excellent setting that naturally complements the tension and mystery. The environment itself can be both beautiful and menacing, with its own set of challenges (wildlife, getting lost, natural hazards) that players must navigate alongside the central threats. To ensure the game is engaging, developers would need to balance gameplay elements (action, survival, exploration, puzzle-solving) and narrative depth (character arcs, backstory of the creature, moral dilemmas). The game could also offer players choices that affect the outcome, enhancing its replayability and personal significance. In conclusion, the plot you\'ve outlined has great potential for a thrilling and immersive game, offering players a mix of action, strategy, and horror with a rich narrative foundation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Это делается с помощью классов, реализующих интерфейс `IPostprocessBuildWithReport` или `IPreprocessBuildWithReport` для действий до начала процесса сборки. Для использования этих интерфейсов необходимо подключить пространство имен `UnityEditor.Build` и `UnityEditor.Build.Reporting`. Вот базовый пример того, как можно вызвать скрипт после сборки в Unity: 1. Создайте новый скрипт C# в вашем проекте Unity (например, с именем `BuildPostProcessor.cs`). 2. В этом скрипте, используйте следующий код как основу: ```csharp using System.Diagnostics; using UnityEditor; using UnityEditor.Build; using UnityEditor.Build.Reporting; using UnityEngine; public class BuildPostProcessor : IPostprocessBuildWithReport { // Установите порядок выполнения. 0 - достаточно рано, вы можете использовать и другие числа, // если необходимо контролировать порядок выполнения по отношению к другим скриптам. public int callbackOrder { get { return 0; } } public void OnPostprocessBuild(BuildReport report) { // Здесь делайте непосредственно то, что нужно после сборки. // Например, вызов скрипта: RunMyScript(); } void RunMyScript() { // Путь к вашему скрипту string scriptPath = \\"/путь/к/вашему/скрипту/myscript.bat\\"; ProcessStartInfo startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo() { FileName = scriptPath, // Если нужно, установите рабочую директорию // WorkingDirectory = \\"/путь/к/рабочей/директории\\", UseShellExecute = false, CreateNoWindow = true, // Скрыть окно командной строки WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden // Или используйте ProcessWindowStyle.Normal для отображения }; Process proc = new Process() { StartInfo = startInfo }; proc.Start(); } } ``` 3.

Помните, что этот код должен находиться в директории `Assets/Editor` вашего проекта Unity, чтобы он корректно компилировался и запускался в качестве части процесса сборки. Это требование обусловлено тем, что Editor API, которое используется для работы со сборкой, работает только внутри среды Unity Editor и не включается в финальную сборку игры.

Eyewitnesses at the scene report that the event, dubbed the \\"Peanut Party,\\" was held last Saturday and might have been more about proving a point than promoting healthy eating. Jessica Milner, a 38-year-old mother of two and self-proclaimed \\"battle-against-picky-eating\\" warrior, is at the center of this culinary controversy. Neighbors were shocked to learn that Milner\'s method of dealing with her 6-year-old son, Timmy\'s aversion to certain foods, involved organizing a party with the sole purpose of him eating a single peanut. Witnesses say the afternoon started innocuously with games and snacks typical of a child\'s party. The mood shifted, however, when Milner announced it was \\"peanut time\\" and presented her son with a plate that held a solitary peanut. Guests report a tense atmosphere as Milner insisted that Timmy consume the peanut, despite his visible distress and refusal. \\"It was supposed to be fun, but when the peanut came out, everything just felt off,\\" noted one concerned attendee, who preferred to stay anonymous. \\"We thought it was a joke at first. No one could believe she was serious.\\" The standoff reportedly ended when Timmy, under immense pressure, ate the peanut. While he suffered no physical harm, the psychological impact of the incident has sparked heated debates online and within the Rivertown community on the ethics of such extreme parenting tactics. Experts are weighing in on the situation, condemning Milner\'s actions as misguided and potentially harmful. \\"Picky eating in children is a complex issue that should be approached with sensitivity and understanding,\\" explains Dr. Lena Goodwin, a child psychologist. \\"Forcing a child to eat something in a high-pressure setting can lead to negative associations with food and exacerbate the problem.\\" Social media has exploded with opinions, with many expressing outrage over Milner\'s actions, calling for child welfare services to intervene. Others, however, are voicing support for the frustrated mother, sharing their own battles with picky eaters and the lengths they\'ve gone to in the name of nutrition. As the debate rages on, the \\"Peanut Party\\" has opened a broader conversation about parenting styles, child welfare, and the lengths to which some parents will go to combat picky eating. For now, Timmy is reportedly doing well, with no plans for future food-themed parties. Meanwhile, Jessica Milner remains defiant amid the backlash, but it\'s unclear if her peanut-pushing days are behind her."},{"prompt":"请将“Since the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they exchange their products, the specific social character of each producer’s labour does not show itself except in the act of exchange. In other words, the labour of the individual asserts itself as a part of the labour of society, only by means of the relations the act of exchange establishes directly between the products, and indirectly, through them, between the producers. To the latter, therefore, the relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest appear, not as direct relations between individuals at work, but as what they really are, material relations between persons and social relations between things. [1965, p. 73; emphasis added] Social relations do not merely appear to be relations between things: rather, this appearance reflects the real fracturing of doing and done, the real rupture of the sociality of doing. Relations between doers really are refracted through relations between things (between dones that deny their origin in the sociality of doing). These things are the fetishised forms of the relations between producers, and, as such, they deny their character as social relations. Commodities, value and money conceal ‘instead of disclos[e], the social character of private labour, and the social relations between the individual producers’ (1965, p. 76). The fracturing of social relations is consolidated by bourgeois thought, which takes these fetishised forms as its basis rather than criticising them: The categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms. They are forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite, historically determined mode of production, viz., the production of commodities. [1965, p. 76] There is, then, no clear distinction here between thought and reality, theory and practice. Theory is an element of practice, actively contributing to the production and reproduction of the separation of doing from done. The starting-point for our thought is the fetishised world which confronts us. We are born into a world in which the community of doing is fractured. The separation of doing and done permeates our whole relation to the world and to those around us. Our vision of the world is already pre-shaped before we begin to reflect critically. Power-over, that separation of doing and done which is inherent in the production of commodities for the market, presents itself here impersonally. Marx introduces fetishism in the context of the production and exchange of commodities. This is not, however, a pre-capitalist phase, for the generalisation of commodity production presupposes the existence of labour power as a commodity, that is, the existence of a capitalist society.4 Commodity fetishism is, therefore, the penetration of capitalist power-over into the core of our being, into all our habits of thought, all our relations with other people. Confronted with the fetishised world, all we can do is criticise. Value, for example, … does not stalk about with a label describing what it is. It is value, rather, that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic. Later on, we try to decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of our own social products; for to stamp an object of utility as a value, is just as much a social product as language … Man’s reflections on the forms of social life, and consequently, also his scientific analysis of those forms, take a course directly opposite to that of their actual historical development. He begins, post festum, with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him. [1965, pp. 74–5] Bourgeois thought has, in the best of cases, managed to decipher some of the social hieroglyphics: ‘Political Economy has indeed analysed, however incompletely, value and its magnitude, and has discovered what lies beneath these forms’ (1965, p. 80). There is, however, a limit to bourgeois criticism. The separation of subject and object, doing and done, inevitably involves a hypostatisation of the present, a fixation of the present. As long as the separation of subject and object is not questioned, as long as the capitalist form of social organisation is not seen as transient, criticism is inevitably blind to the historicity of the phenomena criticised. The rupture of the sociality of doing is assumed to be natural, eternal. In other words, bourgeois (fetishised) thought is blind to the question of form. The question of form (value, money or capital as forms of social relations) arises only if one is alive to the historicity of bourgeois social relations, that is, to the fact that capitalism is a particular historical form of organising relations between people: If … we treat this mode of production as one eternally fixed by Nature for every state of society, we necessarily overlook that which is the differentia specifica of the value-form, and consequently of the commodity-form, and of its further developments, money-form, capital-form, &c. [1965, p. 81] Consequently, bourgeois criticism does not look to the genesis of the phenomenon criticised, does not ask why social relations exist in these forms. The category of form is central to Marx’s discussion in Capital. He speaks of ‘money-form’, ‘commodity-form’, ‘capital-form’, and so on. These are not to be understood in the sense of a species-genus distinction (money as a ‘form’ or ‘species’ of something else), but simply as a mode of existence. Money, commodity, capital are modes of existence of social relations, the forms in which social relations currently exist.5 These are the frozen or rigidified modes of existence of relations between people. ‘Form’, then, is the echo of the scream, a message of hope. We scream against things as they are: yes, comes the echo, but things-as-they-are are not eternal, they are just the historically congealed forms of social relations: These formulae, which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society, in which the process of production has the mastery over man, instead of being controlled by him, such formulae appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself. [1965, pp. 80–1] But for us who scream, they are neither self-evident nor eternal. It should already be clear what a central part the concept of fetishism plays in revolutionary theory. It is at once a critique of bourgeois society, a critique of bourgeois theory and an explanation of the stability of bourgeois society. It points at once to the dehumanisation of people, to our own complicity in the reproduction of power, and to the difficulty (or apparent impossibility) of revolution. The concept of fetishism is central to Marx’s critique of capitalist society.6 The theme of dehumanisation is constantly present in Marx’s discussion in Capital and elsewhere. In capitalism there is an inversion of the relation between people and things, between subject and object. There is an objectification of the subject and a subject-ification of the object: things (money, capital, machines) become the subjects of society, while people (workers) become the objects. Social relations are not just apparently but really relations between things (between money and the state, between your money and mine), while humans are deprived of their sociality, transformed into ‘individuals’, the necessary complement of commodity exchange. (‘In order that this alienation be reciprocal, it is only necessary for men, by a tacit understanding, to treat each other as private owners, and by implication as independent individuals’ (1965, p. 87).) In the long and detailed discussion of conditions in the factory and the process of exploitation, the emphasis is constantly on the inversion of subject and object: Every kind of capitalist production, in so far as it is not only a labour-process, but also a process of creating surplus-value, has this in common, that it is not the workman who employs the instruments of labour, but the instruments of labour that employ the workman. But it is only in the factory system that this inversion for the first time acquires technical and palpable reality. [1965, p. 423] It is not only for the physical misery that it brings, but above all for the inversion of things and people that Marx condemns capitalism: for the fetishisation of social relations in other words. Inextricably linked with the condemnation of the inversion of subject and object in bourgeois society is the critique of bourgeois theory which takes this inversion for granted, which bases its categories on the fetishised forms of social relations: the state, money, capital, the individual, profit, wages, rent, and so on. These categories are derived from the surface of society, the sphere of circulation, in which the subjectivity of the subject as producer is completely out of sight and all that can be seen is the interaction of things and of the individuals who are the bearers of these things. It is here, where social subjectivity is hidden from view, that liberal theory blooms. This sphere of circulation is ‘a very Eden of the innate rights of man. There alone rule Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham’ (1965, p. 176). The whole three volumes of Capital are devoted to a critique of political economy, that is, to showing how the conceptions of political economy arise from the fetishised appearances of social relations. Political economy (and bourgeois theory in general) takes for granted the forms in which social relations exist (commodity-form, value-form, money-form, capital-form, and so on). In other words, bourgeois theory is blind to the question of form: commodities and money (and so on) are not even thought of as being forms, or modes of existence, of social relations. Bourgeois theory is blind to the transitory nature of the current forms of social relations, takes for granted the basic unchangeability (the ‘is-ness’) of capitalist social relations. Bourgeois thought, however, is not just the thought of the bourgeoisie, or of capitalism’s active supporters. It refers rather to the forms of thought generated by the fractured relation between doing and done (subject and object) in capitalist society. It is crucially important to see that the critique of bourgeois theory is not just a critique of ‘them’. It is also, and perhaps above all, a critique of ‘us’, of the bourgeois nature of our own assumptions and categories, or, more concretely, a critique of our own complicity in the reproduction of capitalist power relations. The critique of bourgeois thought is the critique of the separation of subject and object in our own thought. The fetishism which is so highly elaborated in the work of the political economists and other bourgeois theorists is equally the basis of everyday ‘common-sense’ conceptions in capitalist society. The assumption of the permanence of capitalism is built into the daily thought and practice of people in this society. The appearance and real existence of social relations as fragmented relations between things conceal both the basic antagonism of those relations and the possibility of changing the world. The concept of fetishism (rather than any theory of ‘ideology’ or ‘hegemony’) thus provides the basis for an answer to the age-old question, ‘Why do people accept the misery, violence and exploitation of capitalism?’ By pointing to the way in which people not only accept the miseries of capitalism but also actively participate in its reproduction, the concept of fetishism also underlines the difficulty or apparent impossibility of revolution against capitalism. Fetishism is the central theoretical problem confronted by any theory of revolution. Revolutionary thought and practice is necessarily anti-fetishistic. Any thought or practice which aims at the emancipation of humanity from the dehumanisation of capitalism is necessarily directed against fetishism. ”翻译为中文","completion":"由于生产者们直到他们交换产品时才进入社会接触，每位生产者的劳动的特定社会性质只有在交换行为中才显现出来。换言之，个人的劳动只有通过交换行为所直接建立的产品间的关系、间接地通过产品间的关系建立的生产者间的关系，才能够作为社会劳动的一部分表现出来。因此，对生产者而言，将一个人的劳动与其他人的劳动连接起来的关系，并非作为工作中个体之间的直接关系出现，而是以它们实际上的存在形式——人与人之间的物质关系以及物与物之间的社会关系出现。[1965, p. 73；强调添加] 社会关系并不仅仅表现为事物之间的关系：事实上，这种表象反映了行动与被行动之间真实的断裂，社会化行动的真实分断。行动者之间的关系确实通过事物之间的关系（否认其起源于行动社会化的已完成事物之间的关系）而被折射。这些事物是生产者之间关系的拜物教式表现形式，如此，它们否认了自身作为社会关系的性质。商品、价值和货币掩盖了“而不是揭露，私人劳动的社会性质，以及个体生产者之间的社会关系”(1965, p. 76)。 通过资产阶级思想的巩固，社会关系的断裂被加强，这种思想将这些拜物教式形式作为其基础而不是批判它们： 资产阶级经济的范畴由此类形式构成。它们是以社会有效性表达一个特定的、历史确定的生产模式的条件和关系的思想表现形式，即商品生产。[1965, p. 76] 因此，在这里不存在思想与现实、理论与实践之间的清晰区别。理论是实践的一个元素，积极地促进了做与被做之间分离的生产与再生产。 我们思考的起点是我们面对的这个拜物教式的世界。我们出生在一个行动共同体被断裂的世界中。做与被做的分离贯穿了我们与世界以及我们周围人的全部关系。在我们开始批判性反思之前，我们对世界的看法已经被预设形状。权力至上，即在商品市场生产中固有的做与被做的分离，在这里以非人格化的形式表现出来。马克思在商品生产和交换的背景下引入拜物教。然而，这并不是一个前资本主义阶段，因为商品生产的普遍化前提是劳动力作为商品的存在，即资本主义社会的存在。因此，商品拜物教是资本主义权力至上渗透到我们存在的核心，渗透到我们所有的思想习惯、我们与其他人的所有关系中。 面对这个拜物教式的世界，我们所能做的就是批判。例如，价值 ……并不是带着一个标签四处走动，告诉我们它是什么。恰恰相反，是价值将每一产品转化为社会象形文字。后来，我们试图解读这些象形文字，揭示我们自己社会产品的秘密；因为将一个实用物品标记为价值，就像语言一样，同样是一种社会产品……人对社会生活形式的反思，因此，对这些形式的科学分析，也正好与它们的实际历史发展过程相反。他从现成的发展过程结果开始，事后（post festum）开始反思。[1965, pp. 74–75] 资产阶级思想在最好的情况下，确实分析了价值及其大小，发现了这些形式下隐藏的内容（1965, p. 80）。然而，资产阶级批判有一个局限。主体与客体、做与被做的分离，不可避免地涉及对现状的物化，对当前状态的固定。只要主体与客体的分离没有被质疑，只要资本主义的社会组织形式没有被视为是暂时的，批判就不可避免地对批判现象的历史性视而不见。做的社会性的断裂被假定为自然的、永恒的。换句话说，资产阶级（拜物教式的）思想对形式的问题视而不见。只有当人们对资产阶级社会关系的历史性有所察觉时，即认识到资本主义是组织人与人之间关系的一种特定历史形式时，形式的问题（作为社会关系形式的价值、货币或资本）才会被提出： 如果……我们将这种生产模式视为每个社会状态的永恒自然固定模式，我们必然忽略了价值形式的特异性，因此也忽略了商品形式及其进一步发展的货币形式、资本形式等的特异性。[1965, p. 81] 因此，资产阶级批判没有观察到被批判现象的生成，没有询问社会关系为何以这些形式存在。 形式的范畴是马克思在《资本论》中讨论的中心。他提到了“货币形式”、“商品形式”、“资本形式”等。这些不应被理解为物种-属的区分（货币作为某物的“形式”或“物种”），而仅仅作为一种存在方式。货币、商品、资本是社会关系的存在模式，是当前社会关系存在的形式。5 这些是人与人之间关系的冻结或僵化的存在模式。“形式”，因此，是呼喊的回声，是希望的信息。我们对现状的呼喊：是的，回声来了，但事物的现状并非永恒，它们只是社会关系历史凝固的形式： 这些公式，它们上面清楚地印有属于一个社会状态的不可误认的字样，在这个社会状态下，生产过程控制了人，而不是被人控制，这样的公式在资产阶级智力中看来就像是自然赋予的必然性一样，就像生产劳动自身一样。[1965, pp. 80–81] 但对我们这些呼喊者来说，它们既不是自明的，也不是永恒的。 应该已经清楚，拜物教概念在革命理论中扮演了核心部分。它既是对资产阶级社会的批判，对资产阶级理论的批判，也是对资产阶级社会稳定性的解释。它同时指向了人的非人性化，我们在资产阶级权力再生产中的同谋，以及革命的困难（或表面的不可能性）。 拜物教概念是马克思对资本主义社会批判的中心。6 马克思在《资本论》及其他处的讨论中不断呈现的人的非人性化主题。在资本主义中，人与物、主体与客体之间的关系发生了倒转。主体被物化，物被赋予了主体性：物（货币、资本、机器）成为社会的主体，而人（工人）成为了客体。社会关系不仅在表面上而是在实质上成为了物与物之间的关系（货币与国家之间、你的货币与我的货币之间），而人则被剥夺了他们的社会性，被转化为“个体”，商品交换所必需的互补物。（“为了使这种异化互为对方，只需要人通过默认的理解，互相对待作为私有所有者，并暗示作为独立个体。”[1965, p. 87]。）在关于工厂条件和剥削过程的长篇详细讨论中，不断强调的是主体和客体的倒转： 每一种资本主义生产，只要它不仅仅是一个劳动过程，而且还是一个创造剩余价值的过程，都有一个共同之处，那就是不是工人使用劳动工具，而是劳动工具使用工人。但只有在工厂制度中，这种倒转才首次获得技术上和实际上的现实。[1965, p. 423] 马克思谴责资本主义不仅是因为它带来的物理痛苦，更重要的是因为事物和人的倒转：换句话说，是因为社会关系的拜物教化。 与对资产阶级社会中主体和客体倒转的谴责不可分割的是对资产阶级理论的批判，这种理论将这种倒转视为理所当然，将其范畴建立在社会关系的拜物教化形式之上：国家、货币、资本、个体、利润、工资、租金等。这些范畴源于社会的表面，即流通领域，在那里，作为生产者的主体的主观性完全看不见，所有看得见的只是事物的相互作用以及那些携带这些事物的个体的相互作用。正是在这个社会主体性被隐藏的地方，自由主义理论繁荣起来。这个流通领域是“人的固有权利的伊甸园。那里唯有自由、平等、财产和边沁统治”（1965, p. 176）。《资本论》的整个三卷本都致力于对政治经济学的批判，也就是说，展示政治经济学的概念是如何源于社会关系的拜物教化表象。政治经济学（以及一般的资产阶级理论）认为社会关系存在的形式（商品形式、价值形式、货币形式、资本形式等）是理所当然的。换句话说，资产阶级理论对形式的问题视而不见：商品和货币（等等）甚至没有被认为是社会关系的形式或存在模式。资产阶级理论对当前社会关系形式的暂时性视而不见，认为资本主义社会关系的基本不变性（“是-性”）是理所当然的。 然而，资产阶级思想不仅仅是资产阶级或资本主义的积极支持者的思想。它更指的是资本主义社会中做与被做（主体与客体）断裂关系生成的思想形式。至关重要的是要看到，对资产阶级理论的批判不仅仅是对“他们”的批判。它还是，也许首先是对“我们”的批判，对我们自己的假设和范畴的资产阶级性质的批判，或更具体地说，是对我们自己在资本主义权力关系再生产中的同谋的批判。对资产阶级思想的批判是对我们自己思想中主体和客体分离的批判。 政治经济学家和其他资产阶级理论家高度发展的拜物教同样是资本主义社会日常“常识”观念的基础。资本主义的永久性假设被内置于这个社会中人们的日常思想和实践中。社会关系作为事物之间断裂关系的表象和实质存在，既掩盖了这些关系的基本对立，也掩盖了改变世界的可能性。拜物教概念（而不是任何“意识形态”或“霸权”理论）因此提供了回答古老问题“为什么人们接受资本主义的苦难、暴力和剥削？”的基础。通过指出人们不仅接受资本主义的苦难，还积极参与其再生产，拜物教概念还强调了反对资本主义的革命的困难或表面的不可能性。拜物教是任何革命理论面临的中心理论问题。革命性的思想和实践必然是反拜物教的。任何旨在从资本主义的非人化中解放人类的思想和实践必然是针对拜物教的。"},{"prompt":"请将“IV The tragic dilemma of revolutionary change, the fact that its urgency and its apparent impossibility are two sides of the same process, intensifies to the degree that the fetishism of social relations becomes more penetrating and more pervasive. The separation of doing and done, of subject and object, it is clear from Marx’s discussion in Capital, goes beyond the immediate ‘tearing away from man the object of his production’ by the exploiting class. It is not just that the capitalist tears away from the worker the object which she has produced. The fact that the sociality of doing is mediated (broken and stuck together cracked) through the market (the sale and purchase of commodities) means that the rupture of doing and done is by no means limited to the immediate process of exploitation, but extends to the whole society. Although Marx’s focus in Capital is on the critique of political economy, there is no reason at all to think that fetishism extends only to the sphere conceptualised by political economy. The implication of Marx’s discussion is rather that fetishism permeates the whole of society, that the whole of capitalism is ‘an enchanted, perverted,7 topsy-turvy world’ (1972a, p. 830), and that the subjectification of the object and the objectification of the subject is characteristic of every aspect of life. ‘Separation’, says Marx, is the ‘real generation process of capital’ (1972b, p. 422). The question of the all-pervasive character of fetishism is taken up by a number of authors working in the Marxist tradition. The further the argument is developed, the more intense the tragic dilemma of revolution becomes. The more urgent revolutionary change is shown to be, the more impossible it seems. In terms of reification (Lukács), instrumental rationality (Horkheimer), one-dimensionality (Marcuse), identity (Adorno), discipline (Foucault)8, the different authors have emphasised the penetration of power into every sphere of our existence, the increasing closure of existence under capitalism. Their work raises to an excruciating pitch the intensity of the revolutionary dilemma. Rather than try to give an account of the contributions of the different theorists, we shall try to build on their work to develop some of the points made in the previous chapter. This involves going back over the argument so far. The starting-point is the separation of doing and done. This implies an antagonistic separation between the doers and the appropriators of the done. The appropriators of the done (the owners of capital) use their control of the done, which is the means of doing, to get the doers to labour for them to increase the done which they appropriate. The capitalists, in other words, exploit the workers: they pay them what they need in order to survive (the value of their labour power) and appropriate the surplus that they produce (the surplus value). The separation of doing and done implies a dual class analysis, an antagonism between capital and the working class. This is fundamentally important and nothing in the argument should be taken as derogating from this position. This class antagonism is often understood within the Marxist and socialist tradition to be an external relation. It is assumed that the antagonism between working class and capital is an external antagonism which leaves the two sides untouched in their fundamentals. The two sides of the antagonism are then a good side (working class) and a bad side (capitalist class). In such a perspective, one might expect that the question of revolution would be a relatively simple one, largely a practical question of organisation. Why, then, has there not been a successful communist revolution? The answers given are usually in terms of ideology, hegemony or false consciousness. The working class does not rise up because it is imbued with the ideology of the market; in a class society, the ideas of the ruling class are hegemonic; the working class suffers from false consciousness. In each case, the question of ideology, hegemony or false consciousness is separated from the question of the separation of doing from done: the sphere of ideology is seen as separate from the ‘economic’. The emphasis on the lack of understanding of the working class is usually (inevitably?) accompanied by an assumption that the working class is a ‘they’. ‘They’ have the wrong ideas, so our role (we who have the right ideas) is to enlighten them, to illuminate them, to bring them true consciousness.9 The political problems inherent in such an approach should be obvious. A second problem with such an approach is simply that it is unable to account for the complexity of the world. Lines are drawn too crudely, the complexity of social connections is short-circuited, so that Marxism loses its power of conviction. This has been particularly obvious in discussions of changing forms of social conflict in recent years – conflict around issues of gender or the environment, for example. There has been a tendency either to force such struggles into a preconceived mould of class struggle, or to speak of them as ‘non-class struggles’. In the latter case, the concept of non-class struggle is accompanied either by the view that class struggle is diminishing in importance or that, in spite of everything, the fundamental conflict between capital and labour still remains the most important form of conflict. The understanding of the conflict between labour and capital as an external conflict which leaves both sides essentially untouched leads to the conception of the antagonism as an immediate one, in which both sides are immediately, empirically present. And then come the problems: where was the working class in the struggle against the Vietnam War, against nuclear weapons, where is the working class in support of the Zapatista uprising, how can we speak of working-class revolution when the working class is numerically on the decline, and so on. All of these questions can be answered, of course, but the cumulative evidence of a separation between ‘the working class’ as an empirically identifiable group and the most striking forms of rebellion has led to a progressive undermining of the idea that capitalism should be understood in terms of a basic class antagonism. The argument here is that a class understanding of capitalism is fundamental, but that the class antagonism cannot be understood as an external relation, nor can class be understood in this immediate way. The separation of doing and done, as we have already begun to see in the previous chapter and in the first sections of this one, is not just a simple antagonism between doers and the appropriators of that which is done. Capitalist power-over, the separation of doing and done, is like one of those horrific modern bullets which do not simply pierce the flesh of the victim but explode inside her into a thousand different fragments. Or, less horrifically, capitalist power is like a rocket that shoots up into the sky and explodes into a multitude of coloured flares. To focus on the flares or the fragments of the bullet without seeing the trajectory of the rocket or the bullet is what much postmodern theory (or, indeed, bourgeois theory in general) does.10 On the other hand, to focus just on the primary movement of the bullet or the rocket and to treat the flares and the fragments as something external (non-class struggle) is a crudity that is politically unhelpful and theoretically unconvincing. The concept of fetishism is concerned with the explosion of power inside us, not as something that is distinct from the separation of doing and done (as in the concepts of ‘ideology’ and ‘hegemony’), but as something that is integral to that separation. That separation does not just divide capitalists from workers, but explodes inside us, shaping every aspect of what we do and what we think, transforming every breath of our lives into a moment of class struggle. The problem of why revolution has not happened is not a problem of ‘them’, but a problem of a fragmented ‘us’. We live, then, in an ‘enchanted, perverted, topsy-turvy world’ in which relations between people exist in the form of relations between things. Social relations are ‘thingified’ or ‘reified’. The term ‘reification’ is the one used by Lukács in his History and Class Consciousness, published in 1923. As the term ‘reification’ suggests, Lukács insists on its relevance for every aspect of social life.11 Reifi-cation is not just associated with the immediate labour process, nor just something that affects the ‘workers’: ‘The fate of the worker becomes the fate of society as a whole’ (1971, p. 91). And: The transformation of the commodity relation into a thing of ‘ghostly objectivity’ … stamps its imprint upon the whole consciousness of man … And there is no natural form in which human relations can be cast, no way in which man can bring his physical and psychic ‘qualities’ into play without their being subjected increasingly to this reifying process. [1971, p. 100] V The separation of doing from done (and its subordination to the done) establishes the reign of is-ness, or identity. Identity is perhaps the most concentrated (and most challenging) expression of fetishism or reification. The breaking of the flow of doing deprives doing of its movement. Present doing is subordinate to past done. Living labour is subordinated to dead labour. Doing is frozen in mid-flight, transformed into being. The beauty, transfixed by the witch’s curse, losing her movement loses her beauty: sleeping beauty is a contradiction in terms. The freezing is not absolute (any more than the rupture of doing is absolute). It is not that everything stands still, but everything is locked into a perpetual continuity, everything is repeated, everything moves forward on tracks. If the world is looked at from the point of view of doing, it is clearly impossible to say ‘the world is’, or ‘things are’, or ‘I am’. From the perspective of doing, it is clear that everything is movement: the world is and is not, things are and are not, I am and am not. The contradiction that is inherent in these statements presents no problem if we think in terms of doing: in doing I go beyond myself, the world moves beyond itself, and so on. The change in me that is implied in my doing means that I am and am not. But once doing is broken, once doing is subordinated to the done, movement is halted and the statement that I am and am not seems incoherent. Once doing is ruptured, it is no longer doing and contradiction that prevail. Identity rules, contradiction is flattened. The world is, that’s the way things are: if we say ‘the world is and is not; that’s the way things are and are not’, these now seem meaningless, illogical statements.”翻译为中文","completion":"IV 革命性变革的悲剧性困境在于，其紧迫性与其表面上的不可能性是同一过程的两面，随着社会关系的拜物教化变得更加深入和普遍，这种困境愈发加剧。 正如马克思在《资本论》中的讨论所明确的，做与被做、主体与客体的分离，超越了剥削阶级\\"从人手中夺走其生产物\\"的直接行为。不仅仅是资本家从工人手中夺走了她所生产的物品。行动的社会性通过市场（商品的买卖）被介导（断裂并粘合得有缺口）的事实意味着，做与被做的断裂绝不仅限于剥削的直接过程，而是扩展到整个社会。虽然马克思在《资本论》中重点批判了政治经济学，但完全没有理由认为拜物教仅限于政治经济学概念化的范围。马克思讨论的暗示则是，拜物教贯穿整个社会，整个资本主义是\\"一个魔法、颠倒、错乱的世界\\"(1972a, p. 830)，客体的主体化和主体的客体化是生活各方面的特征。马克思说，\\"分离\\"是\\"资本的真正生成过程\\"(1972b, p. 422)。 拜物教普遍性特质的问题被马克思主义传统中的一些作者所关注。论证越发展，革命的悲剧性困境就变得越加剧烈。革命性变革被展示为越加紧迫，它看起来也就越不可能。从物化（卢卡奇）、工具理性（霍克海默）、一元化（马尔库塞）、同一性（阿多诺）、纪律（福柯）8的角度来看，不同的作者强调了权力渗透到我们存在的每一个领域，资本主义下存在的日益封闭性。他们的工作将革命困境的紧迫性提升到了极致。 我们不打算对不同理论家的贡献进行描述，而是试图基于他们的工作来发展前一章中提出的一些观点。这包括重新审视到目前为止的论证。 起点是做与被做的分离。这意味着行动者与完成物的占有者之间存在敌对的分离。占有完成物的者（资本的所有者）利用他们对完成物的控制——也就是行动的手段，来让行动者为他们劳动，以增加他们占有的完成物。换言之，资本家剥削工人：他们支付工人生存所需（他们的劳动力价值）并占有工人生产的剩余（剩余价值）。做与被做的分离意味着双重阶级分析，资本与工人阶级之间的对立。这一点至关重要，论证中的任何内容都不应被视为对这一立场的贬低。 这种阶级对立在马克思主义和社会主义传统中常常被理解为外部关系。人们假设工人阶级与资本之间的对立是一种外部对立，这种对立未触及双方的根本。对立的两方因而是好的一方（工人阶级）和坏的一方（资本家阶级）。在这样的视角下，人们可能期望革命问题是一个相对简单的问题，主要是组织的实践问题。那么，为什么没有成功的共产主义革命发生呢？给出的答案通常涉及意识形态、霸权或错误意识。工人阶级没有起义是因为他们被市场的意识形态所渗透；在阶级社会中，统治阶级的观念是霸权性的；工人阶级受到错误意识的影响。在每种情况下，意识形态、霸权或错误意识的问题都与做与被做的分离问题分开：意识形态领域被视为与“经济”分离。对工人阶级缺乏理解的强调通常（不可避免地？）伴随着一个假设：工人阶级是一个“他们”。 “他们”持有错误的观念，所以我们的角色（我们这些有正确观念的人）就是启迪他们、照亮他们、带给他们真正的意识。9 这种方法固有的政治问题应该是显而易见的。 这种方法的第二个问题仅仅在于它无法解释世界的复杂性。划分得过于粗糙，社会联系的复杂性被简化，导致马克思主义失去了说服力。这在近年来关于社会冲突变化形式的讨论中特别明显——例如，围绕性别或环境问题的冲突。有一种倾向是将这类斗争硬塞到预设的阶级斗争模式中，或将它们称为“非阶级斗争”。在后一种情况下，非阶级斗争的概念要么伴随着阶级斗争重要性递减的观点，要么尽管一切，资本与劳动之间的基本冲突仍然是最重要的冲突形式的观点。将劳动与资本之间的冲突理解为不触及双方本质的外部冲突，导致了将对立视为直接的、双方均立即、经验性地存在的观念。然后就出现了问题：在反对越南战争、反对核武器的斗争中工人阶级在哪里，在支持萨帕蒂斯塔起义时工人阶级在哪里，当工人阶级在数量上减少时，我们如何谈论工人阶级革命，等等。当然，所有这些问题都可以得到回答，但“工人阶级”作为一个可以经验性识别的群体与最显著的反叛形式之间的累积证据逐渐削弱了应该用基本阶级对立来理解资本主义的观点。 这里的论点是，对资本主义的阶级理解是基本的，但阶级对立不能被理解为外部关系，阶级也不能以这种直接方式被理解。正如我们已经在前一章和本章的第一部分开始看到的，做与被做的分离不仅仅是行动者与完成物占有者之间简单的对立。资本主义的权力至上，即做与被做的分离，就像是那些恐怖的现代子弹，不仅仅是穿透受害者的肉体，而是在她体内爆炸成千上万的碎片。或者，不那么恐怖地说，资本主义权力就像一枚射向天空并爆炸成无数彩色焰火的火箭。专注于焰火或子弹的碎片，而不看火箭或子弹的轨迹，是许多后现代理论（或确切地说，一般的资产阶级理论）所做的事情。10 另一方面，仅仅关注子弹或火箭的初级运动，并将焰火和碎片视为外部的东西（非阶级斗争），是一种在政治上无益、在理论上不令人信服的粗糙做法。 拜物教概念关注的是权力在我们内部的爆炸，不是作为与做与被做的分离（如在“意识形态”和“霸权”概念中）不同的东西，而是作为与该分离不可分割的东西。这种分离不仅将资本家与工人分开，而且在我们内部爆炸，塑造我们所做的和我们所想的每一个方面，将我们生活的每一次呼吸都转化为阶级斗争的时刻。为什么革命尚未发生不是“他们”的问题，而是一个破碎的“我们”的问题。 因此，我们生活在一个“魔法、颠倒、错乱的世界”中，人与人之间的关系以物与物之间的关系的形式存在。社会关系被“物化”或“物神化”。 “物化”一词是卢卡奇在1923年出版的《历史与阶级意识》中使用的。正如“物化”一词所暗示的，卢卡奇坚持认为它对社会生活的每一个方面都是相关的。11 物化并不仅与直接劳动过程相关，也不仅影响“工人”：“工人的命运成为整个社会的命运”(1971, p. 91)。并且： 将商品关系转化为“幽灵般的客体性”的过程……在人的整个意识上留下了印记……没有一种自然形式能够承载人类关系，没有一种方式可以让人发挥他的物质和心理“品质”，而不越来越多地受到这种物化过程的影响。[1971, p. 100] V 做与被做的分离（及其对被做的从属）确立了是-性（is-ness）或同一性的统治。同一性或许是拜物教或物化最集中（最具挑战性）的表达形式。行动的流动的断裂剥夺了行动的动态。当前的行动从属于过去的被做。活的劳动从属于死的劳动。行动在半途被冻结，转化为存在。美丽在女巫的诅咒下失去了动态，失去了美丽：沉睡的美人是一个悖论。这种冻结并不是绝对的（就像做与被做的断裂并不是绝对的）。并不是一切都静止不动，但一切都被锁定在永恒的连续性中，一切都在重复，一切都在轨道上前进。 如果从行动的角度看世界，显然不可能说“世界存在”，或“事物存在”，或“我存在”。从行动的角度来看，很明显一切都是运动的：世界既存在又不存在，事物既存在又不存在，我既是又不是。如果我们从行动的角度思考，这些陈述中固有的矛盾不会构成问题：在行动中，我超越了自我，世界超越了自身，等等。行动中的变化意味着我既存在又不存在。但一旦行动被断裂，一旦行动从属于被做，运动就停止了，声称我既存在又不存在似乎是不连贯的。一旦行动被断裂，就不再是行动和矛盾占主导。同一性统治一切，矛盾被抹平。世界就是这样，事物就是这样：如果我们说“世界既是又不是；事物就是这样也不是这样”，这些现在似乎是毫无意义、不合逻辑的陈述。"},{"prompt":"请将“Identity implies the homogenisation of time. When the flow of doing is broken and doing subjected to the done and its quantitative accumulation, then doing is forced onto certain tracks, contained within certain parameters. Doing is reduced to labour, limited to doing-in-the-service-of-the-expansion-of-capital. This both limits the content of doing and imposes a certain (and ever-increasing) rhythm upon doing. Labour, as doing has become, is measured quantitatively: it is labour for a certain number of hours, labour that produces something that can be sold for a price, labour that produces value, labour which is rewarded quantitatively in money by a wage. People’s doing becomes converted into a train that moves faster and faster, but along pre-established tracks: ‘Time sheds its qualitative, variable, flowing nature; it freezes into an exactly delimited, quantifiable continuum filled with quantifiable “things” … : in short, it becomes space’ (Lukács 1971, p. 90). Time becomes clock time, tick-tick time, in which one tick is just the same as another: a time that moves but stays still, treadmill time.12 The varying intensity of lived time, of the time of passion and happiness and pain, is subordinated to the tick-tick of the clock. Homogeneous time has the present as its axis. It is not that the past and the future are completely denied, but the past and especially the future are subservient to the present: the past is understood as the pre-history of the present, and the future is conceived as the pre-visible extension of the present. Time is seen as a linear movement between past and future. Radically alternative possibilities for the future are pushed aside as fiction. All that lies, lay or might lie outside the tracks of tick-tick time is suppressed. Past struggles that pointed towards something radically different from the present are forgotten: ‘All reification is a forgetting’, as Horkheimer and Adorno put it (1972, p. 230). The rule of identity is the rule of amnesia. Memory,13 and with it hope, are subordinated to the relentless movement of the clock which goes nowhere: ‘Only with the farewell to the closed, static concept of being does the real dimension of hope open’ (Bloch 1986, p. 18). The rule of identity implies certain linguistic hierarchies. It implies, for example, the dominance of one verb, ‘is’, over all the others.14 In a world that is defined, other verbs are deactivated: their force is limited by that which is. Doing is a doing which is not just limited by, but permeated by, that which is: our everyday activity is constrained and permeated by that which is.15 Put differently, Isness implies the dominance of nouns over verbs. That which is becomes crystallised, consolidated, rigidified into nouns: in nouns movement is suppressed or contained. Just as time becomes tick-tick time, movement becomes tick-tick movement, the movement of an object without subject, a movement that itself becomes a thing, a movement rather than a moving. The separation of doing from done is the separation of constitution or genesis from existence. That which is done is separated off from the doing which did it. It acquires a separate existence distinct from the doing which constituted it. I make a chair. From the perspective of the social flow of doing, there is a fleeting objectification of the chair: it is immediately integrated through use (through doing) into the collective flow (if it is not used, it ceases to be a chair from the perspective of doing). But in capitalism, the objectification is more than fleeting. The chair which I made exists now as the property of my employer. It is a commodity which can be sold. Its existence is quite separate from its constitution. Indeed, its constitution or genesis (the doing which made it) is negated by its existence as a commodity: it is forgotten, a matter of total indifference to the existence of the chair. The purchaser uses the chair and in that sense reincorporates it into doing, but the flow is (really and apparently) broken: there is absolutely no direct relation between the doing of the user and the doing of the maker. Existence acquires a duration. The time of existence of the chair is a time of duration: the chair now is, its is-not-ness totally forgotten. Constitution and existence are sundered. The constituted denies the constituting, the done the doing, the object the subject. The object constituted acquires a durable identity. It becomes an apparently autonomous structure. This sundering (both real and apparent) is crucial to the stability of capitalism. The statement that ‘that’s the way things are’ presupposes that separation. The separation of constitution and existence is the closure of radical alternatives.16 VI The separation of doing from done and the transformation of doing into being (identity) that it implies is the core not only of the rigid-ification of time but also of the disintegration of every aspect of social relations. If the social flow of doing is what braids people’s lives together, if it is the material formation of a ‘we’, then the fracturing of the collective doing which capitalism involves pulls the braid apart, tears the individual strands of the braid one from another. If the flow of doing implies community, a community across time and space, then the breaking of that flow dismembers all possibility of community. The breaking of the collective flow of doing brings with it the individualisation of the doers. For the exchange of commodities to take place, both the commodities and their producers must be abstracted from the collectivity of doing: In order that this alienation [of commodities] may be reciprocal, it is only necessary for men, by a tacit understanding, to treat each other as private owners of those alienable objects, and by implication as independent individuals. But such a state of reciprocal independence has no existence in a primitive society based on property in common … [Marx 1965, p. 87] The starting-point for thought becomes not the person-as-part-of-the-community but the individual as a person with his17 own distinct identity. Community can thenceforth be imagined only as the aggregation of discrete individuals, the putting together of beings rather than the flow of doings. The individual stands apart from the collectivity. He is separated from his species-being or species-life, as the young Marx puts it. In the bourgeois notion of science, that is, in the notion of science which assumes capitalist society to be permanent, this distancing of the individual from the community is prized as a virtue. The further away the scientist of society stands from the society which he is studying the better. The ideal scientist would be an observer placed on the moon, from where he would be able to analyse society with true objectivity. The collectivity, society, becomes an object, separated from the subject by as great a distance as possible. In this way of thinking, science and objectivity are regarded as synonymous. To study something scientifically is to study it objectively or, if it is accepted that this is not possible, then the scientist must do his best to aproximate objectivity, to maintain a distance from the object of study. Objectivity here means suppressing our own subjectivity as far as possible: a subjective statement is considered, by definition, to be unscientific. The notion of what is scientific is thus based upon an obvious falsehood, namely the idea that it is possible to express a thought that excludes the thinker. (This does not, of course, mean that a statement that is explicitly subjective is thereby necessarily correct or scientific.) Identity thus implies a third-person discourse. To write scientifically, we write about things in the third person, as ‘it’ or ‘they’: political parties are such and such; Marxism is so and so; Britain is this or that. First-person discourse (I am bored by political parties; we want a better life; above all, we scream) is regarded as unscientific. Study or theory is therefore study of something or about something, as in: social theory is the study of society, that is a book about Marxism, today we are going to learn about Mexico in the nineteenth century. In each case, the preposition ‘of’ or ‘about’ marks a separation or distance between the student or theorist and the object of study.18 ‘Knowledge about’ is quite simply the other side of ‘power-over’. The best students or theorists of society are those who can view society as though they stood outside it. (Students who find this pretence difficult often have problems in getting their work recognised, although, again, this does not mean that first-person discourse is thereby correct.) Theory, then, is what the word ‘theory’ (from θɛω, I view) suggests: a viewing or contemplation of an external object. The subject is present, but as a viewer, as a passive rather than an active subject, as a de-subjectified subject, in short as an objectified subject. If we write about ‘it’, then the only way in which we may appear scientifically is as viewer (voyeur).19 Then, precisely because the theory is seen as existing separately from the theorist, it is seen as something that can be ‘applied’ to the world. The third person of which we speak is a third-person present indicative. What is important in thought that takes identity as its basis is things as they are, not things as they might be or as we wish they were. There is no room for the subjunctive in the scientific discourse of identitarian thought. If we are excluded, then our dreams and wishes and fears are excluded too. The subjunctive mood, the mood of uncertainties, anxieties, longings, possibilities, the mood of the not yet, has no place in the world of objectivity. The language of the world of ‘that’s-the-way-things-are’ is firmly in the indicative mood. The breaking of the social flow of doing implies, then, that I (no longer the vague ‘we’) as a social scientist abstract from my feelings and my position in society and try to understand society as it is. Society presents itself to me as a mass of particulars, a multitude of discrete phenomena. I proceed by trying to define the particular phenomena that I want to study and then seeking the connection between those defined phenomena. Identity implies definition. Once the flow of doing is fractured, once social relations are fragmented into relations between discrete things, then a knowledge which takes that fragmentation for granted can only proceed through defining, delimiting each thing, each phenomenon, each person or group of people. Knowledge proceeds through definition: something is known if it can be defined. What is politics? What is sociology? What is economics? What is a political party? What is Marxism? The introductory questions to study in schools or universities are typically definitional questions. Postgraduate theses typically begin with a definition or delimitation of the object of study. Definition is the description of an identity which is distinct from other identities. Definition aims to delimit identities in a non-contradictory manner: if I define x, it does not make any sense, from a definitional perspective, to say that x is both x and non-x. Definition fixes social relations in their static, fragmented, reified is-ness. A definitional world is a clean world, a world of clear divisions, a world of exclusion, a world in which the other is clearly separated as other. Definition constitutes otherness. The definition of x constitutes non-x as other. If I define myself as English, then I am not Irish; if I define myself as white, then I am not black; if I define myself as Aryan, then I am not Jewish. The Irish, the blacks, the Jews are Others, not-Us. A whole world of horror is contained in the process of definition. ”翻译为中文","completion":"同一性意味着时间的同质化。当行动的流动被打破，行动受制于已完成的事物及其数量上的积累时，行动就被迫进入某些轨道，被限制在某些参数内。行动被简化为劳动，仅限于为资本扩张服务的行动。这既限制了行动的内容，又强加了一种（且不断增加的）节奏于行动之上。劳动，作为已变成的行动，被量化衡量：它是为一定小时数的劳动，生产可以以一定价格出售的东西的劳动，生产价值的劳动，以金钱形式通过工资量化奖励的劳动。人们的行动被转化为一列越来越快的列车，但沿着预设的轨道运行：“时间失去了其质性、可变性、流动性的特点；它冻结成一个确切界定的、可量化的连续体，充满了可量化的‘事物’...：简而言之，它变成了空间”（卢卡奇1971，第90页）。时间变成了钟表时间，嘀嗒嘀嗒的时间，其中一个嘀嗒与另一个嘀嗒完全相同：时间在移动却又保持静止，跑步机时间。不同强度的生活时间，激情、幸福和痛苦的时间，从属于钟表的嘀嗒嘀嗒。 同质化的时间以现在为其轴心。并不是说过去和未来被完全否定，但过去特别是未来都从属于现在：过去被理解为现在的前史，未来被设想为现在的预见性延伸。时间被视为过去与未来之间的线性运动。彻底不同于现在的未来可能性被排除在外，视为虚构。所有位于嘀嗒嘀嗒时间轨迹之外的东西都被压制。指向与现在截然不同的东西的过去斗争被遗忘：“所有的物化都是一种遗忘”，霍克海默和阿多诺如是说（1972，第230页）。同一性的统治是失忆的统治。记忆，以及与之相伴的希望，从属于无处可去的时钟的无情运动：“只有和封闭的、静态的存在概念告别，希望的真正维度才会打开”（布洛赫1986，第18页）。 同一性意味着某些语言层级制度。例如，它意味着一个动词“是”对所有其他动词的支配。在一个被定义的世界里，其他动词被弱化：它们的力量被现状所限制。行动不仅仅受到限制，而且被现状所渗透：我们的日常活动受到现状的约束和渗透。换句话说，是-性意味着名词对动词的支配。现状变得结晶、巩固、僵化成名词：在名词中，运动被压制或包含。就像时间变成嘀嗒嘀嗒时间一样，运动变成了嘀嗒嘀嗒运动，一个没有主体的物体的运动，自身变成了一种事物，一种运动而不是移动。 行动与已完成的分离是构成或生成与存在之间的分离。已完成的事物与做出它的行动分离开来。它获得了与构成它的行动不同的独立存在。我制造了一把椅子。从社会行动流的角度看，椅子的客观化是短暂的：它通过使用（通过行动）立即融入集体流动（如果它不被使用，从行动的角度看，它就不再是椅子）。但在资本主义中，客观化不仅是短暂的。我制造的椅子现在作为我的雇主的财产而存在。它是可以出售的商品。它的存在与它的构成完全分离。实际上，它的构成或生成（制造它的行动）被它作为商品的存在所否定：它被遗忘，对椅子的存在完全无关紧要。购买者使用椅子，在这个意义上将它重新纳入行动，但流动（实际上和表面上）被打断：使用者的行动与制造者的行动之间绝对没有直接关联。存在获得了持续时间。椅子的存在时间是持续时间：椅子现在存在，它的不存在性完全被遗忘。构成和存在被割裂。所构成的否定了构成的，已完成的否定了行动，客体否定了主体。构成的客体获得了持久的同一性。它变成了一种表面上自主的结构。这种割裂（无论是实际的还是表面的）对资本主义的稳定至关重要。“事情就是这样”的陈述前提了那种分离。构成与存在的分离是激进替代方案的关闭。 VI 行动与已做的分离及其所暗示的行动向存在（同一性）的转化，不仅是时间僵化的核心，也是社会关系各个方面瓦解的核心。如果社会行动的流动是将人们的生活编织在一起的东西，如果它是“我们”的物质形成，那么资本主义所涉及的集体行动的破碎就将这束辫子撕裂，将辫子的个别线条相互撕开。如果行动的流动意味着社区，一个跨越时间和空间的社区，那么这种流动的断裂就粉碎了所有社区的可能性。 集体行动流动的破碎伴随着行动者的个体化。为了商品交换能够发生，商品及其生产者都必须从行动的集体中抽象出来： 为了实现这种商品的异化[以互惠的方式]，只需要人们通过默认的理解，互相对待作为那些可让渡物体的私有所有者，间接地作为独立个体。但是，在基于公共财产的原始社会中，这种互惠的独立状态是不存在的……[马克思 1965，第87页] 思考的出发点不再是作为社区一部分的人，而是作为拥有自己独特同一性的个体。此后，社区只能被想象为离散个体的聚合，将存在拼凑在一起而不是行动的流动。 个体与集体分离开来。他从自己的物种本性或物种生活中分离开来，如年轻的马克思所言。在资本主义社会被视为永恒的那种资产阶级的科学观念中，这种个体与社区的距离被视为一种美德。社会科学家离他所研究的社会越远越好。理想的科学家将是一个置身月球的观察者，从那里他将能够以真正的客观性分析社会。集体、社会成为一个对象，与主体尽可能远地分离。 在这种思维方式中，科学与客观性被视为同义词。科学地研究某物意味着客观地研究它，或者，如果接受这是不可能的，那么科学家必须尽最大努力接近客观性，与研究对象保持距离。这里的客观性意味着尽可能压抑我们自己的主观性：主观的陈述被认为是非科学的定义。因此，科学的概念基于一个明显的谬误，即认为有可能表达一个排除了思想者的思想。（当然，这并不意味着明确主观的陈述因此就必然是正确的或科学的。） 同一性因此暗示了第三人称话语。为了科学地写作，我们以第三人称写作关于事物：政党是某某；马克思主义是如何如何；英国是这样或那样。第一人称话语（我对政党感到厌烦；我们想要更好的生活；最重要的是，我们呐喊）被认为是不科学的。因此，学习或理论是关于某物的学习，如：社会理论是对社会的研究，这是一本关于马克思主义的书，今天我们将学习十九世纪的墨西哥。在每种情况下，“关于”或“对于”的介词标志着学生或理论家与研究对象之间的分离或距离。关于知识是对权力的另一面。“对社会有最好理解的学生或理论家是那些能够将社会视为自己站在其外部的人。（发现这种伪装难以做到的学生经常在使他们的工作得到认可方面遇到问题，尽管再次强调，这并不意味着第一人称话语因此就是正确的。）因此，理论正如单词“理论”（来自希腊语θɛω，我观察）所暗示的：对外部对象的观察或沉思。主体存在，但作为观察者，作为被动而非主动的主体，作为去主体化的主体，简而言之，作为被物化的主体。如果我们写关于“它”，那么我们科学地出现的唯一方式是作为观察者（窥视者）。然后，正因为理论被视为与理论家分开存在，它被视为可以“应用”到世界上。 我们所谈论的第三人称是第三人称现在时。基于同一性为基础的思想中重要的是事物的现状，而不是事物可能的状态或我们希望它们是什么样的状态。在以同一性为基础的科学话语中，没有虚拟语气的空间。如果我们被排除在外，那么我们的梦想、愿望和恐惧也被排除了。虚拟语气，不确定性、焦虑、渴望、可能性的语气，尚未发生的事物的语气，在“事情就是这样”的世界的语言中没有位置。在该世界的语言坚定地使用陈述语气。 社会行动流的断裂意味着，我（不再是模糊的“我们”）作为一个社会科学家，从我的感受和我在社会中的位置中抽象出来，试图理解社会的现状。社会呈现给我的是一大堆零散的现象，众多的离散现象。我通过尝试定义我想研究的特定现象，然后寻找这些定义现象之间的联系，来进行我的研究。 同一性意味着定义。一旦行动的流动被打断，一旦社会关系被碎片化为离散事物之间的关系，那么以这种碎片化为前提的知识只能通过定义来推进，为每件事物、每种现象、每个人或人群划界。知识通过定义来推进：如果某物可以被定义，就被认为是已知的。政治是什么？社会学是什么？经济学是什么？政党是什么？马克思主义是什么？学校或大学中的研究入门问题通常是定义性问题。研究生论文通常以对研究对象的定义或划界开始。定义是对与其他身份不同的身份的描述。定义旨在以非矛盾的方式划定身份：如果我定义了x，从定义的角度来看，说x即是x又是非x是没有意义的。定义固定了静态、碎片化、物化的社会关系。定义性的世界是一个干净的世界，一个有明确划分的世界，一个排他性的世界，一个将他者清晰地作为他者的世界。定义构成了他者性。对x的定义构成了非x作为他者。如果我定义自己为英国人，那么我就不是爱尔兰人；如果我定义自己为白人，那么我就不是黑人；如果我定义自己为雅利安人，那么我就不是犹太人。爱尔兰人、黑人、犹太人是他者，非我们。定义过程中包含了一个恐怖的世界。"},{"prompt":"请将“Definition excludes us as active subjects. The ‘we’ who started this book, the still unexplored ‘we’ who want to change the world, are excluded from a definitional view of the world. When we define something, we normally define it as separate from us. Definition constitutes that which is defined as an object, as an object which, by its definition, is separated from the subject. It is no different when ‘we’ are defined, as in ‘we are women’ or ‘we are the working class’: the definition delimits us, denies our active subjectivity (at least in relation to that which is defined), objectifies us. The we-who-want-to-change-the-world cannot be defined.20 The world of identity is a world of particulars, individualised and atomised. The table is a table, the chair is a chair, Britain is Britain, Mexico is Mexico. Fragmentation is fundamental to identitarian thought. The world is a fragmented world. A world of absolute identity is thereby also a world of absolute difference. Knowledge of the world is equally fragmented, into the distinct disciplines. Study of society takes place through sociology, political science, economics, history, anthropology, and so on, with all their distinct sub-disciplines and endless specialisations, which rest in turn on fragmented concepts of space (Britain, Mexico, Spain), time (the nineteenth century, the 1990s) and social activity (the economy, the political system). VII But what is beyond this fragmentation? A world composed purely of particulars would be impossible to conceptualise and impossible to inhabit. The fracturing of doing is the fracturing of sociality, but some sort of sociality is necessary, both conceptually and practically. The sociality is no longer a communal braiding of doing, more a lumping together of particulars into the same bag, much as potatoes in a sack might be said to form a collectivity, to adapt Marx’s famous description of the peasants as a class.21 Collectivities are formed on the basis of identity, on the basis of being, rather than on the movement of doing. This is the process of classification. Doing may well be part of the process of classification, but it is a dead doing, doing that is contained within an identity, within a role or character-mask: classification of doctors as a group, say, is based not on the weaving together of their doing, but on their definition as a certain type of doer, on the imposition of a character-mask as doctor. Classes in this sense are always more or less arbitrary: any collection of identities can be thrown into a sack together, sub-divided into smaller bags, put together into larger containers, and so on. It is the fracturing of doing that, through definition and classification, constitutes collective identities. It is the fracturing of doing that creates the idea that people are something – whatever, doctors, professors, Jews, blacks, women – as though that identity excluded its simultaneous negation. From the perspective of doing, people simultaneously are and are not doctors, Jews, women, and so on, simply because doing implies a constant movement against-and-beyond whatever we are. From the perspective of doing, definition can be no more than an evanescent positing of identity which is immediately transcended.22 The barrier between what one is and what one is not, between collective self and collective other cannot therefore be seen as fixed or absolute. It is only if one takes identity as one’s standpoint, only if one starts from the acceptance of the rupture of doing, that labels such as ‘black’, ‘Jewish’, ‘Irish’, and so on, take on the character of something fixed. The idea of an ‘identity’ politics which takes such labels as given inevitably contributes to the fixation of identities. The appeal to being, to identity, to what one is, always involves the consolidation of identity, the strengthening, therefore, of the fracturing of doing, in short, the reinforcement of capital.23 As long as one remains within the concept of identity, then, it makes little difference whether one thinks of that identity as woman or man, black or white, gay or heterosexual, Irish or English. This does not mean, however, that these categories are symmetrical, that the struggles of blacks can simply be treated as equivalent to the struggles of whites, or that the women’s movement is the same as a men’s movement. The distinction cannot be made on the basis of identity: it would be nonsensical to say there are good identities and bad identities. The distinction lies rather in the fact that there are many situations in which an apparently affirmative, identitarian statement carries a negative, anti-identitarian charge. To say ‘I am black’ in a society characterised by discrimination against blacks is to challenge the society in a way in which to say ‘I am white’ in those same societies clearly does not: despite its affirmative, identi-tarian form, it is a negative, anti-identitarian statement. To say ‘we are indigenous’ in a society that systematically denies the dignity of the indigenous is a way of asserting dignity, of negating the negation of dignity, of saying ‘we are indigenous and more than that’. The negative charge of such statements, however, cannot be understood in a fixed manner: it depends on the particular situation and is always fragile. To say ‘I am Jewish’ in Nazi Germany is not the same as saying ‘I am Jewish’ in contemporary Israel; to say ‘I am black’ in apartheid South Africa is not the same as saying it in post-apartheid South Africa. There is a tension in such positive-negative statements, a tension in which the positive constantly threatens to engulf the negative. Thus, for example, the nationalism of the oppressed (anti-imperialist nationalism), although it may aim at radical social transformation, is easily diverted from its broader aims into simply replacing ‘their’ capitalists with ‘ours’, as the history of anti-colonial movements makes clear. Alternatively, of course, the positive-negative tension may also explode in the opposite direction, into an explicitly anti-identitarian movement, as is currently the case of the Zapatista movement in Mexico. Classification, the formation of collective identities on the basis of definition, is, of course, not just of immediately political relevance. It is fundamental to the scientific procedure as it is conceived in capitalist society.24 It is the core of formal abstraction – the attempt to conceptualise the world on the basis of static and non-contradictory categories, rather than on the basis of movement and contradiction (substantive or determinate abstraction) (see Gunn, 1987b, 1992; Bonefeld, 1987, 1992). Formal abstraction, abstraction on the basis of identity in other words, is the basis of all the methods and procedures which are recognised as scientific in our institutions of teaching and learning. Through classification, conceptual hierarchies are formed. Particulars are ordered under universals, universals under higher universals, and so on. This is a desk chair; the desk chair is an upright chair; the upright chair is a chair; the chair is a piece of furniture. A hierarchy of species and genera is established: a desk chair is a species, or type, or form, or class, of upright chair. The hierarchical ordering of concepts is at the same time a process of formalisation: the concept of chair (or furniture) becomes increasingly separated from any particular content. Lips touch in a kiss; a bullet flies towards the victim. Both the touching of the lips and the flying of the bullet are forms of motion. We can speak of the motion of both in a way that abstracts completely from the different contents of kissing and killing. Formalisation, the abstraction from content, makes possible the quantification and mathematisation of the object of study.25 Once lip-touching and bullet-flying are classified as forms of motion, it becomes possible to compare them quantitatively by comparing the speed with which the different objects move. In quantification all content is left behind: lips and bullet are brought together on the unassailable assumption that 1=1, 2=2, 3=3, and so on. Quantification, however, is just one aspect of the way in which mathematics develops the formal abstraction which is inherent in identification. If x is x and y is y, then the only way in which we can bring them into relation with each other is formally, by abstracting from their particular content. If we classify John and Jane as people, we do so not by denying their particular identities (John remains John, Jane remains Jane), but by abstracting from them, by leaving aside their particular contents as John or Jane and focusing on their formal equivalence as people. Formal abstraction is at the same time homogenisation: in identitarian thought one person is equal to another in the same homogeneous way that one tick of time is equal to another, one square metre of space is equal to another. Once particularities are left behind, it is possible to develop a formal reasoning which aims at making the whole structure of identification and classification as rigorous, orderly and non-contradictory as possible. Formal logic26 and mathematics start from the simple identity x=x and develop its implications to the highest degree possible. If x is not x, if x is both x and not-x, then the basis of mathematics is undermined. The mutual exclusion of x and non-x is expressed most clearly in binary logic (Boolean algebra), in which everything is expressed as 1 or 0, True or False, Yes or No. There is no room here for the yes-and-no or maybe of common experience.27 The separation of doing from done which is the basis of fetishism or reification thus involves an increasing formalisation of social relations and a corresponding formalisation of thought. In the course of the Enlightenment, the philosophical accompaniment to the establishment of capitalist social relations, reason becomes increasingly formalised. Where previously the notion of reason had been related to the pursuit of the good or the true, it now becomes progressively limited to the establishment of the formally correct. Truth is reduced to ‘formally correct’: beyond that, truth is seen as a matter of subjective judgement. What is formally correct can be seen as a mathematical problem which abstracts entirely from the content of the matter. The tendency of theory is ‘towards a purely mathematical system of symbols’ (Horkheimer 1972, p. 190). In this … increasingly formalistic universality of reason … value judgement has nothing to do with reason and science. It is regarded as a matter of subjective preference whether one decides for liberty or obedience, democracy or fascism, enlightenment or authority, mass culture or truth. [Horkheimer 1978b, p. 31]”翻译为中文","completion":"定义排除了我们作为主动主体的身份。“我们”是开启这本书的人，那个尚未探索的“我们”，那个想要改变世界的“我们”，被排除在对世界的定义视角之外。当我们定义某物时，我们通常将其定义为与我们分离的东西。定义将被定义的事物构成为一个对象，作为一个对象，根据其定义，它与主体分离。当“我们”被定义时，例如在“我们是女性”或“我们是工人阶级”中，情况并无不同：定义限制了我们，否认了我们的主动主体性（至少与被定义的事物相关），将我们客体化。想要改变世界的“我们”不能被定义。 同一性的世界是一个由个体化和原子化的特殊事物构成的世界。桌子是桌子，椅子是椅子，英国是英国，墨西哥是墨西哥。碎片化是同一性思想的基础。世界是一个碎片化的世界。绝对同一性的世界因此也是一个绝对差异的世界。对世界的认知同样是碎片化的，分为不同的学科。通过社会学、政治学、经济学、历史学、人类学等以及所有它们的不同子学科和无尽的专业化进行，这些学科基于碎片化的空间（英国、墨西哥、西班牙）、时间（十九世纪、1990年代）和社会活动（经济、政治体系）概念。 VII 但这种碎片化的背后是什么？一个纯粹由特殊事物构成的世界将无法概念化，也无法居住。行动的破碎是社会性的破碎，但某种形式的社会性在概念上和实践上是必需的。这种社会性不再是行动的共同编织，而更像是将特殊事物简单地堆砌在同一个袋子里，就像马克思著名的描述农民阶级一样，可能说袋子里的马铃薯形成了一个集体。基于同一性、基于存在而非行动的流动在构成集体。这是分类的过程。行动可能是分类过程的一部分，但它是一种死的行动，被限制在一个身份、一个角色或人物面具内：比如说，将医生作为一个群体进行分类，不是基于他们行动的相互编织，而是基于将他们定义为某种类型的行动者，强加给他们作为医生的角色面具。从这个意义上说的阶级总是或多或少是任意的：任何身份的集合都可以被一起扔进一个袋子里，划分为更小的包裹，放进更大的容器里，等等。 正是行动的破碎，通过定义和分类，构成了集体身份。正是行动的破碎创造了人们是某种东西的观念——无论是什么，医生、教授、犹太人、黑人、女性——好像那种身份排除了其同时的否定。从行动的角度看，人们同时是也不是医生、犹太人、女性等，仅仅因为行动意味着不断地反对并超越我们所是的任何东西。从行动的角度看，定义不过是对身份的一种瞬间设定，它立即被超越。我们是与我们不是之间、集体自我与集体他者之间的界限因此不能被视为固定或绝对的。只有当以同一性为立场，只有当从接受行动的断裂出发时，“黑人”、“犹太人”、“爱尔兰人”等标签才会具有某种固定性质的特征。以这些标签为既定基础的“身份”政治不可避免地促进了身份的固定。提倡存在、身份、我们所是的东西，总是涉及到身份的巩固，因此加强了行动的破碎，简而言之，加强了资本的力量。 只要停留在同一性的概念内，无论是将身份视为女性或男性、黑人或白人、同性恋或异性恋、爱尔兰人或英国人，这都无多大差别。然而，这并不意味着这些类别是对称的，黑人的斗争可以简单地被视为与白人的斗争等价，或女性运动与男性运动相同。区别不能基于身份：说有好的身份和坏的身份是毫无意义的。区别更多地在于，在许多情况下，一种表面上肯定的、同一性的陈述携带着一种否定的、反同一性的力量。在一个以歧视黑人为特征的社会中说“我是黑人”，是以一种明显不同于在同一社会中说“我是白人”的方式挑战社会：尽管它具有肯定的、同一性的形式，它是一种否定的、反同一性的陈述。在一个系统性否定土著尊严的社会中说“我们是土著”，是一种肯定尊严的方式，是对尊严的否定的否定，是说“我们是土著，而且不止于此”。然而，这种陈述的否定性质不能以固定的方式理解：它取决于特定情况，而且总是脆弱的。在纳粹德国说“我是犹太人”与在当代以色列说“我是犹太人”不同；在种族隔离的南非说“我是黑人”与在后种族隔离的南非说它不同。这种肯定-否定陈述中存在一种张力，肯定不断威胁着吞没否定。因此，例如，受压迫者的民族主义（反帝国主义民族主义），尽管可能旨在实现激进的社会变革，但很容易被偏离其更广泛的目标，仅仅是用“我们的”资本家取代“他们的”资本家，反殖民运动的历史表明了这一点。当然，肯定-否定的张力也可能以相反的方式爆炸，进入明确的反同一性运动，正如墨西哥的萨帕蒂斯塔运动目前的情况。 分类，基于定义形成集体身份的过程，当然不仅仅具有直接的政治相关性。它对于资本主义社会所构想的科学程序至关重要。这是形式抽象的核心——基于静态和非矛盾范畴而非基于运动和矛盾（实质或确定的抽象）来概念化世界的尝试（参见 Gunn, 1987b, 1992; Bonefeld, 1987, 1992）。换句话说，基于同一性的抽象是我们的教学机构中被认可为科学的所有方法和程序的基础。 通过分类，形成了概念层级。特殊事物按照普遍性分类，普遍性按照更高的普遍性分类，等等。这是写字台椅；写字台椅是直立椅；直立椅是椅子；椅子是家具。建立了物种和属的层级：写字台椅是直立椅的一个物种、类型、形式或类别。概念的层级排序同时也是形式化的过程：椅子（或家具）的概念与任何特定内容的分离越来越大。嘴唇在接吻中接触；子弹飞向受害者。嘴唇的接触和子弹的飞行都是运动的形式。我们可以以完全抽象于接吻和杀戮不同内容的方式谈论两者的运动。 形式化，从内容中抽象出来，使得研究对象的量化和数学化成为可能。一旦嘴唇接触和子弹飞行被分类为运动的形式，就可以通过比较不同对象移动的速度来定量比较它们。在量化中所有内容都被抛弃：嘴唇和子弹在1=1、2=2、3=3等不容置疑的假设下被放在一起。 然而，量化只是数学发展固有于认同中的形式抽象的一个方面。如果x是x而y是y，那么我们将它们联系在一起的唯一方式是形式上的，通过抽象它们特定的内容。如果我们将约翰和简分类为人，我们这样做不是通过否认他们的特定身份（约翰仍然是约翰，简仍然是简），而是通过抽象它们，忽略他们作为约翰或简的特定内容，关注他们作为人的形式等价性。形式抽象同时也是同质化：在同一性思想中，一个人等同于另一个人，就像一个时间的嘀嗒等同于另一个时间的嘀嗒，一个平方米的空间等同于另一个平方米的空间一样。一旦特殊性被抛弃，就可以发展一种旨在使认同和分类的整个结构尽可能严谨、有序和非矛盾的形式推理。形式逻辑和数学从简单的同一性x=x开始，并将其含义发展到尽可能高的程度。如果x不是x，如果x既是x又是非x，那么数学的基础就被破坏了。x和非x的相互排斥在二元逻辑（布尔代数）中表达得最清楚，在二元逻辑中，一切都表达为1或0、真或假、是或否。这里没有常见经验中的是也不是或也许的空间。 行动与已完成的分离，也就是拜物教或物化的基础，因而涉及社会关系的日益形式化和思想的相应形式化。在启蒙运动的过程中，随着资本主义社会关系的确立，理性变得越来越形式化。在此之前，理性的概念与追求善或真相关，现在逐渐被限制为建立形式上正确的东西。真理被简化为“形式上正确”：除此之外，真理被视为主观判断的问题。形式上正确的东西可以被视为一个完全抽象于事物内容的数学问题。理论的趋势是“朝着纯粹的数学符号体系”（霍克海默1972，第190页）。在这种趋势中， …越来越形式化的理性普遍性……价值判断与理性和科学无关。人们选择自由或服从、民主或法西斯、启蒙或权威、大众文化或真理，被视为主观偏好的问题。[霍克海默1978b，第31页]"},{"prompt":"je souhaite créer un jeu de \\"couleur book\\" où les enfants peuvent avoir des dessins sur mon site et colorier les dessins en ligne. est-ce que tu pourrais me donner des appli ou comment le faire ?","completion":"Créer un jeu de \\"coloriage\\" ou \\"Color Book\\" en ligne pour enfants est une excellente idée pour stimuler la créativité et l\'apprentissage.

Her presence disrupts the aquatic symphony, a solitary figure enveloped by the cold embrace of the sea. As she descends further into the depths, her movements are both graceful and frantic, a desperate search for salvation in an environment that offers none. Her hair, once a symbol of her vibrant essence, now billows around her in a haunting display of beauty amidst turmoil. It flows like dark ink in water, spreading out in tendrils that weave an intricate dance of their own. Each strand is a brushstroke, painting a portrait of struggle and elegance. The color, a deep chestnut with hints of auburn that glimmer faintly when caught by the sparse rays of light piercing the watery veil, adds a fiery contrast to the cool blues that surround her. This woman, whose identity is as obscured as the murky waters she finds herself in, moves with a certain poise that belies her desperate situation. Her hair, a manifestation of her fierce spirit, follows her in an ethereal trail, marking her path through the abyss. It swirls and floats, creating patterns that momentarily disrupt the monotony of the ocean’s vast emptiness. In this moment, she and her hair are one—a fusion of human fragility and the untamed force of nature. The water, both a medium of life and a harbinger of doom, plays with her hair in a morbid parody of affection, caressing it with watery fingers, attempting to soothe even as it suffocates. As the pressure builds and the light from above becomes but a memory, the woman\'s descent slows. Her struggle ebbs, her movements become more deliberate, and her hair settles around her like a shroud, a final testament to the life that flickers within. In this underwater realm, where time seems to hold its breath, the tale of the woman with the chestnut hair unfolds—a silent scream in the overwhelming quiet of the deep blue."},{"prompt":"consider an isentropic diffuser that have subsonic flow in all cross sections. assume that P_0(stagnation pressure in upstream) and P_b(back pressure in downstream) are constant. now we increase the lenght of diffuser which it means we increase the cross section area . assume that the flow still subsonic.Now, how should we justify this contradiction that although the pressure ratio of (P_b/P_0) remains constant so the Mach should not change, on the other hand, we know that the cross-sectional area has increased and the Mach should decrease at the outlet of this diffuser. Is there a way to fix this?","completion":"One way to address this apparent contradiction is to consider the effect of the entropy change in the flow. In an isentropic process, the entropy of the flow remains constant. As the cross-sectional area of the diffuser increases, the flow expands and the velocity decreases. This decrease in velocity leads to a decrease in the Mach number of the flow, even though the pressure ratio remains constant. Therefore, even though the pressure ratio (P_b/P_0) remains constant, the decrease in velocity resulting from the increase in cross-sectional area causes the Mach number to decrease at the outlet of the diffuser. In summary, the decrease in Mach number is a result of the entropy change in the flow due to the expansion and decrease in velocity, even though the pressure ratio remains constant."},{"prompt":"so if (P_b/P_0) remains constant, the mach number should remains constant. the problem is here.","completion":"You are correct that in an isentropic process, if the pressure ratio remains constant, the Mach number should also remain constant. In this case, if the diffuser is isentropic and the pressure ratio (P_b/P_0) remains constant, the Mach number should theoretically remain constant as well. However, if the flow is subsonic in all cross sections of the diffuser, and the cross-sectional area is increased, this would typically lead to a decrease in the Mach number at the outlet. This discrepancy may indicate that the assumption of isentropic flow is not exactly valid or that there are some other factors at play. One possible explanation could be that there are losses in the diffuser such as friction, heat transfer, or other non-ideal effects that are causing the Mach number to decrease even though the pressure ratio remains constant. These losses could be causing an increase in entropy and affecting the flow properties. In summary, if the pressure ratio remains constant and the flow is isentropic, the Mach number should theoretically remain constant. Any deviation from this behavior may be attributed to non-ideal effects or assumptions in the analysis."},{"prompt":"but we said we have an isentropic diffuser, which means entropy is constant, but all factors you said such as friction, heat transfer, will change entropy. we want the diffuser to stay isentropic.","completion":"You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. In an isentropic process, entropy remains constant, and any changes in entropy would imply a departure from isentropic behavior. In the case of an isentropic diffuser with subsonic flow in all cross-sections, the pressure ratio (P_b/P_0) remains constant, and the Mach number should also remain constant. However, if the cross-sectional area of the diffuser is increased without any non-ideal effects present, the Mach number should remain constant throughout the diffuser. If there is a contradiction where the Mach number is decreasing as the cross-sectional area increases while the pressure ratio remains constant, there may be some other factors or assumptions at play that are affecting the flow properties. It is essential to reassess the assumptions and factors involved in the analysis to account for the discrepancy and ensure that the behavior of the flow in the isentropic diffuser is accurately predicted."},{"prompt":"in your opinion which factors can affect the flow to reach this situation?","completion":"One possible factor that could affect the flow in an isentropic diffuser with subsonic flow and constant pressure ratio, leading to a decrease in Mach number as the cross-sectional area increases, is the presence of shock waves or flow separation. If the diffuser is not designed properly or if the flow conditions are such that shock waves form within the diffuser, this could cause a decrease in Mach number and disrupt the isentropic behavior of the flow. Similarly, flow separation, where the flow detaches from the walls of the diffuser, could also lead to changes in Mach number and compromise the isentropic process. Additionally, other non-ideal effects such as boundary layer effects, turbulence, and viscosity could also impact the flow properties and result in deviations from the expected behavior. These factors can introduce entropy changes and lead to variations in the flow properties, including the Mach number. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider all these factors and their potential impact on the flow behavior when analyzing the performance of an isentropic diffuser to ensure accurate predictions and explanations for any discrepancies observed in the flow properties."},{"prompt":"no I want factors that won\'t change isentropic assume.","completion":"I apologize for the oversight. If we are considering an isentropic process and assuming all other factors remain constant, there should not be any changes in the flow properties that would lead to a decrease in Mach number as the cross-sectional area increases in an isentropic diffuser with subsonic flow. In the context of an isentropic process with subsonic flow, where the pressure ratio remains constant and entropy is conserved, there should theoretically be no change in Mach number as the diffuser length and cross-sectional area increase. If there is a discrepancy where the Mach number is decreasing despite the isentropic conditions, it may indicate an issue with the assumptions made in the analysis or the understanding of the flow behavior. Ensuring that all assumptions hold true and revisiting the analysis to verify the results would be necessary to address this contradiction."},{"prompt":"Now suppose we want to eliminate this contradiction, what assumptions should we apply.","completion":"To eliminate the contradiction between the constant pressure ratio and the decreasing Mach number as the cross-sectional area of the diffuser increases in an isentropic process with subsonic flow, one possible assumption that could be made is that there are non-ideal effects present in the flow that are not accounted for in the isentropic analysis. For example, these non-ideal effects could include viscous effects, such as boundary layer growth, which could lead to losses in the flow and result in a decrease in Mach number even though the process is assumed to be isentropic. By considering and incorporating these non-ideal effects into the analysis, the discrepancy between the constant pressure ratio and decreasing Mach number may be resolved. Additionally, assumptions about the behavior of the flow near the diffuser walls, such as assuming fully developed flow or neglecting possible flow separation, could also be revisited to ensure that the analysis accurately captures the flow properties within the diffuser. By carefully considering and addressing these non-ideal effects and refining the assumptions used in the analysis, it may be possible to eliminate the contradiction and obtain a more accurate representation of the flow behavior in the isentropic diffuser."},{"prompt":"no we still have no non-ideal effects , whats the other ways?","completion":"If we are assuming an isentropic process with no non-ideal effects present, and we want to eliminate the contradiction between the constant pressure ratio and the decreasing Mach number as the cross-sectional area increases in the isentropic diffuser with subsonic flow, one possible way to reconcile this discrepancy could be to revisit the assumptions about the flow conditions. One assumption that could cause this contradiction is the assumption of subsonic flow in all cross-sections of the diffuser. If the flow is indeed subsonic throughout the diffuser, the Mach number should remain constant as the cross-sectional area increases, given the constant pressure ratio and the isentropic nature of the process. Therefore, one way to eliminate the contradiction could be to reassess the flow conditions and verify that the flow is indeed subsonic in all sections of the diffuser. If there are flow conditions or changes in the flow properties that are leading to supersonic flow in certain sections of the diffuser, this could explain the decreasing Mach number and help to reconcile the discrepancy. By carefully verifying and ensuring that the assumptions about the flow conditions are accurate and consistent with the expected behavior, it may be possible to eliminate the contradiction and ensure that the analysis of the isentropic diffuser with subsonic flow is correctly interpreted."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A lot of businesses are started by people who have hobbies or special talents and want to turn these interests into a business. But scaling up from a hobby to a real business, such as a bakery, restaurant or shop, requires business know-how and a substantial investment. Many people do not have enough of either of these, so they never take the first step. An increasing number of aspiring business owners have found a way to take a first step that makes this transition from hobby to business more gradual, less expensive and less risky. They are taking their dreams and talents on the road - in vans and lorries, and even horse trailers. The first entrepreneurs to do this have been in the food business. In recent years a wave of street food vans has arrived on the scene, serving everything from gourmet cupcakes and burgers to Vietnamese street food. Street food vans have become a way for aspiring chefs to try out recipes and test the water before making a big investment in a traditional, brick-and-mortar business’ Beginning on a small scale has its advantages, the most important of which is the relatively modest size of start-up costs. These costs, which consist primarily of the vehicle and any required equipment, usually come to about £5,000-£10,000, a fraction of what it would cost to start a shop or restaurant. Similarly, overhead costs² are generally low. Mobile business owners must pay for fuel, of course, but other utility payments are modest. With such tightly controlled costs, mobile businesses often break even in a year or two; in contrast, success comes to brick- and-mortar businesses much more slowly, and they often fail within the first two years. In short, mobile businesses are relatively low-risk propositions. The mobile food vendor trend in the US and Europe has spread to other parts of the globe. Today, you can get waffles and pancakes from a lorry in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and tacos from an old school bus in Dubai. The success of these street food vans has inspired other entrepreneurs to consider starting out on wheels. Rich Harper once ran a chain of gyms, but his real interest was boxing. In 2005, he bought an old lorry, equipped it with some gym equipment andtook to the streets - all for a total start-up cost of just under £5,000. His business quickly made a profit and is still going strong, as he brings the boxing ring to customers all over his state. UK entrepreneurs could take inspiration from the US where, today, there are vehicles that sell flowers, shoes, clothes and all kinds of specialty food items. There are also mobile businesses that provide services, such as hair styling, pet grooming and repair of high-tech devices. Mobile retail has grown steadily, declaring a 12% increase between 2009 and 2014. Mobile retail is not without problems, however. Weather, the fluctuating price of fuel, and just finding a place to set up are all challenges that mobile entrepreneurs have to deal with. These business owners, however, feel the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In the US, the mobile food business alone the largest in the mobile retail sector - generates an average annual revenue of 857 million. Once convinced that their business has achieved sufficient success, some successful mobile entrepreneurs move on to a brick-and-mortar business. Others, like Rich Harper and his boxing gym, are satisfied to stay mobile. In an interesting twist, some brick-and-mortar business owners, observing the success of mobile retailers, have added a mobile component to their business. The vehicle acts as a marketing tool to bring business into the shop. As stand-alone businesses or as extensions of shops, mobile retail has huge future potential in these economic times. 이 문장을 한국어로 자연스럽게 번역해줘","completion":"취미나 특기를 사업으로 전환하고 싶어하는 많은 사람들이 비즈니스 지식과 상당한 투자금이 부족해 첫 단계를 내딛지 못한다. 하지만 점점 더 많은 예비 사업가들이 이러한 전환을 더 점진적이고 비용이 적게 들며 위험 부담이 덜한 방식으로 시작하는 방법을 찾아냈다. 그들은 자신의 꿈과 재능을 길거리로, 즉 밴, 트럭, 심지어 말 트레일러로 옮겨가고 있다. 이런 방식을 처음 시작한 사람들은 음식 사업 분야에 있었다. 최근 몇 년 동안 거리의 음식 트럭이 등장해 모든 종류의 음식을 제공하기 시작했으며, 이는 거리 음식 트럭이 개인 체험식당이나 전통적인 오프라인 사업을 시작하기 전에 레시피를 시험해 보고 시장을 탐색할 수 있는 방법이 되었다. 소규모로 시작하는 것은 특히 창업 비용이 비교적 작다는 큰 장점이 있다. 이 비용은 주로 차량과 필요한 장비로 구성되며 대개 £5,000-£10,000 정도로, 상점이나 식당을 시작하는 데 드는 비용의 일부에 불과하다. 마찬가지로 고정 비용도 일반적으로 낮다. 모바일 사업주는 연료 비용을 지불해야 하지만 다른 유틸리티 비용은 적다. 이처럼 비용을 엄격히 통제함으로써, 모바일 기업은 종종 일 년에서 두 해 안에 손익분기점에 도달한다; 이와는 대조적으로, 성공은 오프라인 기업에 더 천천히 오며, 그들은 종종 처음 두 해 안에 실패한다. 간단히 말해서, 모바일 비즈니스는 상대적으로 낮은 위험의 제안이다. 미국과 유럽에서 시작된 모바일 음식 판매자 트렌드가 전 세계 다른 지역으로 퍼져 나갔다. 오늘날 사우디아라비아 제다에서는 트럭에서 와플과 팬케이크를, 두바이에서는 오래된 스쿨버스에서 타코를 판매한다. 이러한 거리 음식 트럭의 성공은 다른 기업가들이 바퀴 달린 것으로 시작하는 것을 고려하게 만들었다. 영국의 기업가들은 차량으로 꽃, 신발, 의류 및 각종 전문 식품 항목을 판매하고, 머리 스타일링, 애완동물 그루밍, 고급 기기 수리 서비스를 제공하는 모바일 사업이 점차 성장하고 2009년부터 2014년까지 12% 증가했다는 점에서 미국에서 영감을 받을 수 있다. 모바일 소매는 날씨, 연료 가격의 변동, 그리고 설치 장소를 찾는 것 등 문제에 직면해 있지만, 이러한 비즈니스 소유주들은 장점이 단점보다 크다고 느낀다. 미국에서는 모바일 음식 사업만도 연간 평균 매출액이 8억 5천 7백만 달러에 이른다. 비즈니스가 충분한 성공을 거두었다고 확신한 후, 일부 성공적인 모바일 기업가들은 오프라인 사업으로 전환한다. 반면, 리치 하퍼와 그의 복싱 체육관과 같은 다른 사람들은 모바일 상태를 유지하는 데 만족한다. 흥미로운 반전으로, 모바일 판매자의 성공을 관찰한 일부 오프라인 사업주들은 비즈니스에 모바일 구성요소를 추가했다. 차량은 상점으로 비즈니스를 유치하는 마케팅 도구로 작용한다. 독립적인 사업이든 상점의 확장이든, 모바일 소매는 이 경제 시대에 엄청난 잠재력을 가지고 있다."},{"prompt":"привет при сборке вышла такая ошибка AssetsScriptsEditorVersionIncrementor.cs(3,19): error CS0234: The type or namespace name \'Build\' does not exist in the namespace \'UnityEditor\' (are you missing an assembly reference?)","completion":"Привет!

1. 系统概述 我们有一个名为`Counter_Guide`的模型，该模型主要依赖于内部定义的`Counter_attention`模块，目的在于处理两种不同形态的输入数据：`x`和`event_x`。通过`Counter_attention`模块，模型能够增强其中一种模态的特征，同时使用另一种模态的特征作为上下文信息。具体来说，`Counter_attention`模块利用`Multi_Context`子模块来获取辅助信息，并通过`Adaptive_Weight`子模块调整另一模态特征的重要性，实现互补增强效果。 # 2. `Counter_attention`模块 `Counter_attention`模块是系统的核心，由两个重要部分组成：`Multi_Context`和`Adaptive_Weight`。 - **Multi_Context**: - 作用：通过并行的三个线性层捕获输入特征的不同上下文表示，然后将它们合并提取综合的上下文信息。 - 工作流程：给定辅助输入`assistant`，`Multi_Context`通过三个ReLU激活的线性层分别处理输入，将这三个处理结果在最后一个维度上进行拼接，最后通过一次线性变换得到最终的上下文表示。 - **Adaptive_Weight**: - 作用：通过全局平均池化和两个线性层，为主要输入`present`生成逐元素的重要性权重。 - 工作流程：计算`present`的全局平均池化值，通过两层网络（ReLU激活和Sigmoid激活）生成每个特征的重要性权重，然后调整`present`的特征值，使得其中更重要的特征变得更显著。 # 3. `Counter_Guide`模型 - **工作流程**: 1. 在给定输入`x`和`event_x`时，首先通过`Counter_attention`模块处理`x`作为主要输入（`present`）和`event_x`作为辅助输入（`assistant`），得到增强过后的`out_x`。 2. 同理，再通过`Counter_attention`交换`x`和`event_x`的角色，得到增强过后的`out_event_x`。 3. 通过这种方式，`x`和`event_x`均得到了来自对方的信息增强，实现了双向信息互补。 # 4. 绘制模型架构图 为了清晰地表示这一过程，你可以按照以下步骤来绘制模型架构： 1. **Counter_Guide Level**: - 展示输入特征`x`和`event_x`进入`Counter_Guide`模型的流程。 - 用箭头表示`x`和`event_x`首先交给`Counter_attention`模块的处理。 2. **Counter_attention Level**: - 显示`Counter_attention`内部的两个主要组成部分：`Multi_Context`和`Adaptive_Weight`。 - 画出`assistant`先进入`Multi_Context`的流程，并将其结果与`present`一起通过`Adaptive_Weight`的处理。 3. **Multi_Context & Adaptive_Weight Details**: - 为`Multi_Context`部分，绘制并行的线性层，表示输入通过三条路径的处理，并在最后合并。 - 对于`Adaptive_Weight`，展示全局平均池化后的数据流通过线性层和Sigmoid激活的过程。 通过综合这些步骤和细节，可以形成一幅清晰的、层级化的模型架构图，有效地展示模型的工作原理和信息流动路径。"},{"prompt":"那么将counter_guide拆解为几个部分？","completion":"`Counter_Guide`模型可以拆解为以下几个关键部分： 1. **Counter_attention Module**: 这是模型的核心组件，负责整合来自不同输入（`x`和`event_x`）的信息，并通过注意力机制实现互补增强。`Counter_attention`模块本身包含下面的两个子模块： a. **Multi_Context**: 用于提取输入特征的多个上下文表示。这一部分通过并行的线性层获取不同角度的特征表示，然后合并这些表示以形成一个综合的上下文信息。 b. **Adaptive_Weight**: 用于生成逐元素的权重，这些权重根据`Multi_Context`模块的输出调整主输入特征的重要性。主要通过全局平均池化和一系列线性层实现，最终通过逐元素乘以原特征以调整其重要性。 2. **Forward Mechanism**: 这是`Counter_Guide`模型的前向传播机制，它描述了信息如何流经`Counter_attention`模块。这个部分处理两种输入（`x`和`event_x`），每种输入都分别作为`present`和`assistant`进行处理。这包括了： a. **Enhancement of x**: 使用`event_x`作为辅助信息，通过`Counter_attention`模块增强`x`的表示。 b. **Enhancement of event_x**: 与上一步骤相反，这一步骤使用`x`作为辅助信息，通过`Counter_attention`模块增强`event_x`的表示。 简而言之，`Counter_Guide`的设计主要围绕**信息增强**和**注意力调整**两个核心概念展开，通过`Counter_attention`模块的内部子模块（`Multi_Context`和`Adaptive_Weight`）进行实现，并通过其前向传播机制整合两种不同模态的输入，实现相互补充和增强的效果。这种结构设计增强了模型处理多模态特征并从中提取有价值信息的能力，对于理解和优化多模态学习场景是非常有用的。"},{"prompt":"那么先把Multi_Context的具体步骤写一下，比如：x → linear1 → relu → x1 ; x → linear2 → relu → x2 ,","completion":"以下是`Multi_Context`模块的具体步骤，详细地描述了输入数据`x`如何通过该模块得到增强的过程： 1. **输入数据**: - 输入`x`表示模块接收的原始数据。 2. **通过第一个线性层**: - `x → linear1`：数据`x`首先经过第一个线性层（`self.linear1`），变换为一个新的特征空间，产生临时输出`x1\'`。 3. **ReLU激活1**: - `x1\' → ReLU`：对`x1\'`应用ReLU激活函数，得到激活后的输出`x1`。 4. **通过第二个线性层**: - `x → linear2`：同时，原始数据`x`也经过第二个线性层（`self.linear2`），形成另一组新的特征表示`x2\'`。 5. **ReLU激活2**: - `x2\' → ReLU`：对`x2\'`应用ReLU激活函数，得到激活后的输出`x2`。 6. **通过第三个线性层**: - `x → linear3`：此外，原始数据`x`进一步通过第三个线性层（`self.linear3`），产生第三组特征表示`x3\'`。 7. **ReLU激活3**: - `x3\' → ReLU`：对`x3\'`应用ReLU激活函数，得到激活后的输出`x3`。 8. **特征融合**: - `[x1, x2, x3] → concat`：将上述三个ReLU激活后的输出`x1`, `x2`, `x3`在最后一个维度上进行拼接（concatenate），形成一个综合融合了不同视角信息的特征表示。 9. **通过最终线性层**: - `concatenated output → linear_final`：将融合后的特征向量通过最终的线性层（`self.linear_final`）进行一次变换，得到`Multi_Context`模块的最终输出。 这样，`Multi_Context`模块通过并行化处理并融合不同的特征变换，从而在不同的上下文中捕获输入的特征表达，最终增强了模型的表征能力。"},{"prompt":"那么在画图的时候，linear层需要做区分吗？因为这里由4个linear层","completion":"在绘制`Multi_Context`模块的架构图时，确实需要区分四个`linear`层，因为它们在模块中承担着不同的角色和功能。这不仅有助于清楚地理解模块的工作流程，还方便从视觉上区分各个处理步骤。以下是绘制时的一些建议： 1. **标记每个`linear`层**: - 为每个`linear`层提供唯一标识，例如通过在名称后添加数字进行区分（`linear1`, `linear2`, `linear3`, `linear_final`）。这样可以清楚地表明数据流经的路径。 2. **不同颜色或图案**: - 使用不同的颜色或内部图案（如果是黑白打印的话）来区分每个线性层，可以进一步提升图表的可读性和吸引力。 3. **明确输入输出关系**: - 在数据流向线性层的箭头上或旁边，标明经过ReLU激活前后的数据变量（`x1\'`, `x1`, 等等），这样可以明确每一步的输入输出关系。 4. **特征融合表示**: - 当显示`x1`, `x2`, `x3`合并时，可以用并行线条或者某种形式的叠加显示来象征性地表示这三者的合并过程，再通过一条箭头流向`linear_final`。 5. **上下文强调**: - 考虑到这个结构的目的是为了提供一个丰富的上下文表征，可以在这4个`linear`层的周围或背景上添加一个包含的框或者阴影区域，来强调它们是`Multi_Context`模块的一部分，和整体目标的关联性。 采用这样的策略，你的架构图不仅会清晰地传达信息，也会显得更加专业和容易理解。确保标记和说明都是清楚且一致的，以便于观众能够轻松跟随数据经过各个处理步骤的路径。"},{"prompt":"那么Adaptive_Weight的流程是？","completion":"`Adaptive_Weight`模块的流程涉及全局平均池化操作和两个线性层的逐步处理，最后通过sigmoid激活函数输出权重。下面是详细的步骤： 1. **输入数据**: - 输入`x`表示模块接收的原始数据，这里的`x`可以是`Counter_attention`模块中，经过`Multi_Context`增强后的`present`数据。 2. **全局平均池化**: - `x → Global Average Pooling`：对输入数据`x`在特定维度（通常是时间或空间维度）上应用全局平均池化。这样可以减少数据的维度同时保留重要特征，输出结果为`x_avg`。 3. **通过第一个线性层**: - `x_avg → fc1`：全局平均池化后的数据`x_avg`经过第一个线性层（`self.fc1`），其中通常进行特征维数的压缩。这里，输出维度为输入维度的1/4，输出为`x_fc1`。 4. **ReLU激活**: - `x_fc1 → ReLU`：对第一个线性层的输出应用ReLU激活函数，增加非线性处理，输出为`x_relu`。 5. **通过第二个线性层**: - `x_relu → fc2`：激活后的结果`x_relu`再次经过一个线性层（`self.fc2`），此时通常将特征维度扩展回原来的大小，即输入大小，输出为`x_fc2`。 6. **Sigmoid激活**: - `x_fc2 → Sigmoid`：对`x_fc2`应用Sigmoid激活函数，使输出变为0到1之间的值，代表权重，输出结果为`weight`。这个权重表示原始输入数据中每个特征的重要性。 7. **生成加权特征**: - `x * weight`：最后，原始特征`x`与通过`Adaptive_Weight`生成的权重`weight`进行逐元素的乘法操作（注意`weight`可能需要先进行扩展以匹配`x`的维度），最终生成加权特征`out`，这一步实现了对原始输入特征的自适应重要性调整。 通过这个流程，`Adaptive_Weight`模块能够根据输入特征的全局信息自动学习到一个权重映射，使得网络可以更加关注那些对当前任务更为重要的特征，从而提升模型性能。"},{"prompt":"那么现在按照这样的格式，把整个的counter_guide 流程写处来，整个流程按照 x→ 的格式","completion":"以下是`Counter_Guide`模型中整体流程的详细步骤，采用`x → ...`格式来表示： #

调整`x`以`event_x`为参考的正确表述： 1. **处理`x`利用Multi_Context模块：** - `x → linear1(x) → ReLU → context1` - `x → linear2(x) → ReLU → context2` - `x → linear3(x) → ReLU → context3` 在这个阶段，我们实际上是在处理`x`，通过三个不同的`linear`层和随后的ReLU激活得到三个不同的`context`表示。 - `[context1, context2, context3] → concat → linear_final(concatenated_context) → MC_output_x` 这里`MC_output_x`是对`x`应用`Multi_Context`模块之后得到的输出。为了简化表述，我们假设`Multi_Context`输出便是`x`通过不同上下文增强后的结果。 2. **调整`x`利用`Adaptive_Weight`模块：** 以上述`MC_output_x`为基础（即`x`的增强表示），然后进入`Adaptive_Weight`模块进行进一步调整，如果这里要考虑`event_x`作为上下文或辅助信息对`x`的影响，那么`event_x`应该影响`Adaptive_Weight`的处理过程，但根据初步描述，`Adaptive_Weight`处理的主体是`x`或其变体。 正确的调整步骤应该解释为基于`MC_output_x`对`x`本身的调整，如下： - `x * torch.sigmoid(MC_output_x) → modified_x` （这一步暂时看起来象征性地使用`Multi_Context`的输出来调节`x`，但实际的实现需要更精确的方法来整合这些信息。） - `modified_x → Global Average Pooling → modified_x_avg` - `modified_x_avg → fc1 → ReLU → fc1_output` - `fc1_output → fc2 → Sigmoid → weight` - `modified_x * weight.unsqueeze(1) → weighted_x` # 最终输出： - 最终得到的输出是`weighted_x`，它考虑了通过`Multi_Context`模块增强的`x`特征表示，并通过`Adaptive_Weight`模块调整以强调关键特征的`x`。 请注意，如果意图是通过`event_x`来调整`x`，那么必须在`Adaptive_Weight`处理之前，有一步是明确地结合`event_x`的信息，比如使用`event_x`的某种处理结果来影响`x`的权重生成过程。但按照目前的描述，处理过程主要集中在`x`自身，使用其经过`Multi_Context`增强的表示来进一步调整自己。"},{"prompt":"在counter_guide中，adaptive weight和multi_Context可以分开吗？","completion":"在`Counter_Guide`架构中，`Adaptive_Weight`和`Multi_Context`是独立的模块，它们在设计上是为了解决不同的问题和执行不同任务的。因此，从概念上讲，它们可以分开。不过，在`Counter_Guide`的特定实现中，这两个模块是协同工作的，相互依赖以达到整体的模型目标。以下是它们分开与否的情况： # 如果它们分开： 1. **独立功能**：`Multi_Context`专注于从不同的视角捕捉输入数据的上下文信息，以提供一个综合的上下文表示；而`Adaptive_Weight`负责为特征生成自适应权重，强调重要的特征并减弱不重要的部分。 2. **灵活应用**：将它们设计为独立的模块可以在其他模型或系统中更灵活地重用。例如，可能只需要`Multi_Context`模块在某些场景下提供上下文增强特征，或者单独使用`Adaptive_Weight`针对特定任务调整特征权重。 3. **模块互换**：在某些设计中，可以更容易地用其他模块替代`Multi_Context`或`Adaptive_Weight`以探索不同的上下文增强或权重学习策略。 # 如果它们结合在一起使用： 1. **互补效应**：虽然它们可以独立存在，但在`Counter_Guide`模型中结合使用时，它们提供了互补的功能，其中`Multi_Context`的输出可能作为`Adaptive_Weight`输入的一部分，共同为模型任务（例如特征增强或注意力机制）提供了系统性的解决方案。 2. **增强特征表示**：`Multi_Context`提供的上下文信息可以帮助`Adaptive_Weight`更准确地评估特征的重要性，从而提高了特征表示的质量和模型整体的性能。 3. **紧密协作**：在`Counter_Guide`这样的架构下，它们紧密协作确保输入数据（如`x`和`event_x`）既获得了由`Multi_Context`提供的丰富上下文信息，也被`Adaptive_Weight`准确地重权重，实现了信息的有效整合和利用。 总之，在`Counter_Guide`模型中，尽管`Adaptive_Weight`和`Multi_Context`可以作为独立模块分开，但它们被设计为一起工作，以提供一种结合了上下文增强和自适应权重调整的复杂特征处理策略。这种组合方式充分利用了两者的优点，为复杂任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。"},{"prompt":"那么multi_context中接收几个输入？","completion":"在您提供的`Multi_Context`模块设计中，`Multi_Context`接收**一个**输入。这个输入是一个多维张量，通常代表特征数据。在这个模块的上下文中，输入数据被进一步处理以提取或增强其上下文信息，通过使用并行的线性层和非线性激活函数（如ReLU）来实现。这个处理流程有助于从给定的输入数据中提取多种上下文角度或表示，进一步融合这些表示以形成一个综合的、增强的特征表示。 简单来说，尽管`Multi_Context`可能利用输入数据的不同方面或特性来形成多个上下文表示，它实际上只接收一个输入张量，并以此为基础进行其内部的多路径处理流程。"},{"prompt":"那么现在输入RGB特征x，然后将流程画出来","completion":"为了图示化地表达`Multi_Context`模块处理RGB特征`x`的流程，我们将采用文字描述这一序列的步骤，从而为绘图提供指导。 #

1. `Multi_Context`模块互动 设计目标 `Multi_Context`模块的设计目的在于利用并行的处理路径提取输入特征的多重上下文信息，这里`event_x`作为辅助信息来源加强`x`的表示。 实际操作 - 当`x`通过`Multi_Context`模块的三个线性+ReLU路径（`linear1`, `linear2`, `linear3`加上ReLU）处理时，`event_x`同样也会经过自己的`Multi_Context`模块处理（如果有），但核心在于如何利用`event_x`的信息来影响`x`的处理或反之亦然。 - 一种交互方式可能是，在`x`经过`Multi_Context`模块之后，使用`event_x`的某种统计量或特征（比如其经过`Multi_Context`处理的输出），以动态调整或衡量`x`的处理效应，或者直接参与到最终的线性融合过程中。 # 2. `Adaptive_Weight`模块互动 设计目标 `Adaptive_Weight`模块旨在根据全局信息动态调整特征的权重，强调重要部分。 实际操作 - 以`x`为例，在通过`Adaptive_Weight`模块生成重要性权重时，可以利用`event_x`提供的上下文或状态信息来引导权重的生成。比如，如果`Multi_Context`提供的`event_x`信息表明某些特征更为重要，可以通过加权机制提高这些部分的权重。 - 这意味着`event_x`通过`Multi_Context`和`Adaptive_Weight`的处理结果，间接地影响了`x`的特征重要性调整，这种影响可以通过直接计算或学习到的交互参数来实现。 # 综合思考 - **互补特性增强**：`x`和`event_x`在经过各自的`Multi_Context`和`Adaptive_Weight`处理后，都获得了增强和加权的特征表示。通过设计，两者的处理不仅独立于彼此，也互相影响，实现了信息的双向流动和互补利用。 - **输出融合与应用**：最终，`x`和`event_x`的增强特征可以在后续模型中分别使用或进一步融合，用于决策支持、特征理解或其他高级任务。 总体来说，`x`与`event_x`的互动反映了`Counter_Guide`架构的核心思想，即通过互相提供上下文信息和调整彼此的特征重要性，增强模型对于输入信息的理解和利用。"},{"prompt":"import torch,os import torch.nn as nn from torch.nn.parameter import Parameter class Multi_Context(nn.Module): def __init__(self, inchannels): super(Multi_Context, self).__init__() self.conv2_1 = nn.Sequential( nn.Conv2d(in_channels=inchannels, out_channels=inchannels, kernel_size=1, stride=1, padding=0), nn.BatchNorm2d(inchannels), nn.ReLU(inplace=True)) self.conv2_2 = nn.Sequential( nn.Conv2d(in_channels=inchannels, out_channels=inchannels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(inchannels), nn.ReLU(inplace=True)) self.conv2_3 = nn.Sequential( nn.Conv2d(in_channels=inchannels, out_channels=inchannels, kernel_size=5, stride=1, padding=2), nn.BatchNorm2d(inchannels), nn.ReLU(inplace=True)) self.conv2 = nn.Sequential( nn.Conv2d(in_channels=inchannels * 3, out_channels=inchannels, kernel_size=3, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(inchannels)) def forward(self, x): x1 = self.conv2_1(x) x2 = self.conv2_2(x) x3 = self.conv2_3(x) x = torch.cat([x1,x2,x3], dim=1) x = self.conv2(x) return x class Adaptive_Weight(nn.Module): def __init__(self, inchannels): super(Adaptive_Weight, self).__init__() self.avg = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1) self.inchannels = inchannels self.fc1 = nn.Conv2d(inchannels, inchannels//4, kernel_size=1, bias=False) self.relu1 = nn.ReLU() self.fc2 = nn.Conv2d(inchannels//4, 1, kernel_size=1, bias=False) self.relu2 = nn.ReLU() self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid() def forward(self, x): x_avg = self.avg(x) weight = self.relu1(self.fc1(x_avg)) weight = self.relu2(self.fc2(weight)) weight = self.sigmoid(weight) out = x * weight return out class Counter_attention(nn.Module): def __init__(self, inchannels): super(Counter_attention, self).__init__() self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(nn.Conv2d(in_channels=inchannels, out_channels=inchannels, kernel_size=3, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(inchannels)) self.conv2 = nn.Sequential(nn.Conv2d(in_channels=inchannels, out_channels=inchannels, kernel_size=3, padding=1), nn.BatchNorm2d(inchannels)) #

对`x`的处理流程 1. **通过`Multi_Context`模块**：`x`分别通过三种不同卷积核尺寸（1x1、3x3、5x5）的卷积层加上批标准化（BatchNorm）和ReLU激活函数，对应`Multi_Context`类中的`conv2_1`, `conv2_2`, `conv2_3`。这部分在代码中已经清晰展现。 ```python x1 = self.conv2_1(x) x2 = self.conv2_2(x) x3 = self.conv2_3(x) x = torch.cat([x1,x2,x3], dim=1) x = self.conv2(x) ``` 2. **与`event_x`交互之前的处理**：得到的`x`则通过后续的3x3卷积（`self.conv2`），但在描述中没有提及后续的sigmoid步骤。实际上，在代码实现中`x_new`是通过`self.conv2(x)`而不是直接应用sigmoid得到的。在描述的流程图中，`x_new`应该是`self.conv2(x)`的输出。 # 对`event_x`的处理流程 1. **直接的卷积操作**：对原始的`event_x`应用3x3卷积操作，与`Counter_attention`类中`self.conv1(present)`和`self.conv2(assistant)`的操作对应，这里的`present`实质上就是`x`，而`assistant`就是`event_x`。 ```python pr2 = self.conv1(present) pr2 = present * self.sig(pr2) as2 = self.conv2(assistant) as2 = assistant * self.sig(as2) ``` # 最终的融合和处理 1. **与描述的互动处理**：描述中提到`(原始event_x)`与`x_new`进行元素级相乘得到`x11`，以及`(原始event_x)`与`event_new`相乘得到`x22`，这对应于代码中的`present * self.sig(mc1)`和`assistant * self.sig(mc2)`的操作。`self.sig(mc1)`和`self.sig(mc2)`代表经过处理的`x`和`event_x`分别经过`Sigmoid`激活函数的结果，符合描述中`x_new`和`event_new`的处理流程。 ```python mc1 = self.mc1(assistant) pr1 = present * self.sig(mc1) mc2 = self.mc2(present) as1 = assistant * self.sig(mc2) ``` 2. **输出的组合**：最后的输出是`out1`和`out2`经`Adaptive_Weight`模块处理后相加的结果——`out = out1 + out2`。 # 总结 - 在流程描述与代码中，`Multi_Context`的处理对应于`x`和`event_x`分别经过不同卷积核尺寸处理并合并的过程。 - `x`和`event_x`通过各自的处理并结合`Sigmoid`激活的结果来相互作用，体现在`Counter_attention`模块中的`pr1`和`as1`的计算。 - 最终输出的融合并不直接体现在描述的流程中，但可能是由于对流程简化的需要以及将注意力机制的效果直接应用于融合过程的设计考虑。 - 描述中提到的直接与`x_new`和`event_new`相乘后的处理，并最终与原始的`event_x`相加的流程，在代码中有所体现，通过`Counter_attention`内部的元素级乘法和加法操作来实现。"},{"prompt":"那么在import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.nn.functional as F class Multi_Context(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_channels, output_channels): #

`Adaptive_Weight`模块的实现差异： 1. **自适应平均池化**： - 实现中利用`AdaptiveAvgPool2d`，在每个通道上对空间维度进行全局平均池化以产生全局特征描述。 2. **卷积层代替全连接层**： - 使用`Conv2d`（而非`Linear`）进行权重的学习和调整，使得该过程适用于保持数据的空间结构，这对于图像或其他二维数据尤其重要。 3. **权重生成过程**： - 通过一系列的卷积操作和激活函数，动态地学习每个位置的权重（最终通过`sigmoid`激活输出），这些权重随后用于对应的特征位置进行加权，而不是直接基于线性变换的输出。 # 总结 在`Counter_Guide`模型的实现中，`Multi_Context`和`Adaptive_Weight`模块通过使用卷积层而非全连接层，专门为处理具有空间维度的数据（如图像）而设计。这使得模型能够在捕捉不同尺度的空间特征时保留更多结构信息，并通过动态权重调整更有效地处理这些特征。因此，`Counter_Guide`模型在处理空间数据时表现出对上下文信息的敏感性和对特征重要性的动态适应能力。"},{"prompt":"在上段代码中，以x作为present和event_x作为assistant，然后对于event的处理是？","completion":"在提供的代码片段中，当`x`被视为`present`（当前考虑的主要特征）和`event_x`作为`assistant`（辅助特征提供上下文信息）时，处理`event_x`（`assistant`）的步骤包含以下几个关键环节，参考`Counter_attention`模块的实现： #

Step 1: `Multi_Context`模块处理`assistant` (`x`) 1. **特征线性变换**: - `x`（作为`assistant`）经历三个并行的线性变换（`linear1`, `linear2`, `linear3`），每个变换后接一个ReLU激活函数，以提取不同表达的特征。 2. **特征融合**: - 三个变换之后的特征在特征维度上进行拼接（`torch.cat`），然后通过`linear_final`进行最终的线性变换。这一步实现了多个视角特征的融合。 # Step 2: 对`present` (`event_x`) 应用增强特征 1. **应用`Multi_Context`输出**: - 处理后的`assistant`特征（`mc_output`）通过Sigmoid函数来得到权重，这些权重用于调整`present`特征（`event_x`）的权重，实现特征增强。 2. **特征权重调整**: - 原始`present`特征 (`event_x`) 与`mc_output`的sigmoid输出相乘，得到加权调整后的`present`特征 (`weighted_present`)，在这里，`mc_output`直接影响了`event_x`的表达，体现了`x`（`assistant`）对`event_x`（`present`）的增强作用。 # Step 3: 使用`Adaptive_Weight`模块进一步调整`event_x` 1. **全局信息加权**: - `weighted_present`（加权后的`event_x`）进一步输入到`Adaptive_Weight`模块中，该模块通过全局平均池化和两层线性变换学习一个全局的权重，以Sigmoid激活函数结束，提供最终的特征表示的重要性权重。 2. **最终的特征输出**: - 根据学习到的权重，`Adaptive_Weight`模块输出的权重与`weighted_present`相乘，生成最终调整过权重的`event_x`输出。这一步确保了`event_x`被有效地增强，同时考虑了全局上下文信息的重要性。 # 总结 通过`Counter_attention`模块，`event_x`（作为`present`）得到了来自`x`（作为`assistant`）的信息增强，并进一步通过`Adaptive_Weight`模块进行动态权重调整。这展示了一种强大的方式来充分利用两种不同特征之间的互补信息，从而在多模态特征表达、信息融合和上下文感知任务中提高模型的性能。"},{"prompt":"将Step 3: 使用Adaptive_Weight模块进一步调整event_x的具体流程和小模块写出来","completion":"在`Counter_Guide`架构中，对于`event_x`（作为`present`）经过初步的增强处理后，Step 3涉及使用`Adaptive_Weight`模块进行进一步的动态权重调整。以下是该步骤的详细流程及其组成部分的分解： # 使用`Adaptive_Weight`模块调整`event_x` 初始化`Adaptive_Weight`模块 ```python class Adaptive_Weight(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_channels): super(Adaptive_Weight, self).__init__() self.avg = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1) # 全局平均池化 self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_channels, input_channels // 4) # 第一层线性变换 self.fc2 = nn.Linear(input_channels // 4, input_channels) # 第二层线性变换 self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid() # Sigmoid 激活函数 ``` 前向传播流程 1. **全局平均池化**: 应用自适应平均池化(`AdaptiveAvgPool2d`)将加权后的`event_x`（即`weighted_present`）在每个通道里进行空间维度的全局平均，以捕捉全局上下文信息。 2. **特征降维与映射**: 经过池化得到的全局信息通过一个线性层(`fc1`)降维，其中输入通道数减少到原来的1/4，以减少参数量并提取关键信息。 3. **ReLU激活函数**: 对`fc1`的输出应用ReLU函数，增加非线性，有助于提高模型的表达能力。 4. **特征映射与升维**: 从`fc1`的输出经过第二个线性层(`fc2`)，将特征维度映射回原始维度，为每个原始特征分配权重。 5. **Sigmoid权重生成**: 最后，通过Sigmoid激活函数将`fc2`的输出转换为位于[0, 1]区间的权重，这些权重表示原始特征每个维度的重要程度。 6. **动态特征加权**: 获得的权重通过`unsqueeze`操作调整维度后，与`weighted_present`（加权后的`event_x`）进行元素级乘法，实现特征的动态加权。 完整前向传播函数 ```python def forward(self, x): x_avg = self.avg(x) #

Step 1: `Multi_Context`模块处理`assistant` (`x`) - `x`作为辅助信息（`assistant`）提供上下文信息，通过`Multi_Context`模块进行处理，该模块通过多尺寸卷积核捕获不同尺度的特征，实现多重线性变换和特征融合。 # Step 2: `present` (`event_x`)特征增强 - `event_x`（作为`present`主要特征）经过步骤1处理得到的增强版`assistant`特征（`x`的加工版本），通过Sigmoid函数和元素级乘法调整其特征权重。 # Step 3: 应用`Adaptive_Weight`模块动态调整`event_x` - 经特征权重调整后的`event_x`进一步通过`Adaptive_Weight`模块接收全局信息加权调整，学习一个全局的权重，该权重将`event_x`中每个特征的重要性进行重新调整。 在此过程中，虽流程描述可能聚焦在如何通过`assistant`（在这个上下文中是`x`）来增强`present`（这里是`event_x`），但`event_x`分支自身确实经历了一系列的处理： 1. **与增强后的`assistant`的特征结合**：`event_x`与处理后的`assistant`（`x`）输出特征结合，目的是根据上下文信息调整它自身的特征表达。 2. **特征自增强**：此外，`event_x`自身还可能通过其他卷积层直接进行特征增强处理（这个过程在Counter_attention模块的实现中是可选的，具体取决于模型设计）。 3. **动态特征权重调整**：最后，使用`Adaptive_Weight`模块基于全局特征对`event_x`的各个特征进行动态权重调整，进一步精细化特征表示。 总之，虽然`x`和`event_x`作为`assistant`和`present`的角色分别经过了专门的处理路径，但两者实际上都接受了各自路径上的处理，并在互相增强的逻辑下进行了综合特征的生成和调整。这种设计体现了在处理多模态或互补信息时，通过互相作用增强模型对特征的理解和表示能力的方法。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Урок был спланирован с учетом возрастных особенностей восьмиклассников, их интересов и предпочтений в методах обучения.<br/><br/>В начале урока мной были заложены цели не только усвоения конкретных знаний о неполных квадратных уравнениях, но и развития логического мышления, а также умения анализировать и строить выводы. Я стремился создать дружелюбную атмосферу, чтобы учащиеся не боялись высказываться и демонстрировать свои знания и сомнения.<br/><br/>Методически урок был построен так, что начался с повторения уже известных фактов о квадратных уравнениях. Это позволило сгладить переход к новой теме. После чего был представлен и разобран новый материал, где я использовал презентацию с наглядными примерами неполных квадратных уравнений и методов их решения.<br/><br/>Большую часть урока я посвятил практике: решению задач вместе с классом и работе учеников в группах и индивидуально. Это позволило мне лучше понять уровень усвоения материала каждым учеником и вовремя предоставить обратную связь или дополнительную помощь тем, кто испытывал трудности.<br/><br/>Однако, в ходе урока я заметил, что некоторым учащимся было сложно сосредоточиться, что, возможно, было вызвано монотонностью моих объяснений. В будущем мне стоит внедрить больше интерактивных и игровых форм работы, чтобы повысить вовлеченность и активность всех учеников.<br/><br/>Также я почувствовал необходимость разнообразить дидактические материалы и задания, делая их более доступными и интересными для разных категорий учеников. Важным аспектом, который я извлек из этого опыта, является понимание того, что поддержка и поощрение со стороны учителя играют большую роль в мотивации учеников.<br/><br/>В конце урока я провел рефлексию, позволив учащимся выразить свое мнение о полученных знаниях и процессе обучения, что дало мне дополнительную обратную связь и понимание того, какие аспекты моего преподавания мне следует улучшить в будущем.<br/><br/>В заключение, хотя урок и был не лишен недостатков, я считаю его ценным опытом, который показал мне направления для дальнейшего профессионального и личностного роста как педагога.USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по алгебре 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\". Самоанализ напиши в произвольной формеASSISTANT: Самоанализ моего урока по алгебре на тему “Неполные квадратные уравнения” для 8 класса стал значимым этапом в практике преподавания. Этот опыт позволил мне не только применить теоретические знания, полученные в университете, но и понять глубину своей ответственности как учителя за образовательный процесс.<br/><br/>Основная цель урока – ознакомить учащихся с неполными квадратными уравнениями и научить их успешно решать такие уравнения. Я постарался сделать урок максимально интерактивным и насыщенным, используя презентацию с визуальными примерами и групповую работу, чтобы способствовать лучшему восприятию и усвоению информации учащимися.<br/><br/>В качестве одной из ключевых методик обучения я включил решение задач на доске и работу в парах, что, как мне казалось, должно было способствовать лучшему усвоению материала. Мне удалось охватить различные виды неполных квадратных уравнений, постаравшись обеспечить наиболее ясное понимание методов их решения.<br/><br/>Однако, несмотря на мои усилия, во время урока я столкнулся с рядом сложностей. Некоторые ученики испытывали проблемы с концентрацией внимания и не могли полностью сосредоточиться на изложенном материале. Возможно, это было связано с недостаточным использованием игровых элементов и недостаточно четкой структурированностью урока для удержания внимания учащихся.<br/><br/>Также я заметил, что наличие однотипных заданий вызвало у некоторых учеников скуку, что показывает мне необходимость более тщательного подбора и дифференциации заданий в зависимости от интересов и уровня подготовки каждого ученика.<br/><br/>В заключение, этот опыт учебного урока показал мне важность гибкости и адаптивности в подходах к преподаванию. В дальнейшем я планирую использовать разнообразные методы обучения и контроля, более активно вовлекать учащихся в учебный процесс и уделять больше внимания индивидуальным особенностям и потребностям студентов. Этот урок стал важным уроком и для меня лично, подчеркнув необходимость постоянного самосовершенствования в роли учителя.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по физике 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Зависимость силы тока от сопротивления.

Электрическое сопротивление проводника”<br/><br/><br/>Подготовка и проведение урока по этой теме стали для меня важным испытанием моих педагогических и профессиональных навыков. Задача состояла не просто в изложении теоретического материала, но и в том, чтобы сделать урок понятным и интересным для восьмиклассников, с учетом их возрастных особенностей и предварительных знаний.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Урок начался с краткого повторения предыдущих тем по электричеству, чтобы обеспечить плавный переход к новому материалу. Введение в тему “Электрическое сопротивление проводника” было оформлено в форме презентации с визуальными иллюстрациями, которые помогли проиллюстрировать ключевые понятия.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Особое внимание я уделила практическим заданиям и экспериментам, которые позволили учащимся самостоятельно наблюдать зависимость силы тока от сопротивления в цепи. Это придало уроку интерактивность и способствовало лучшему усвоению материала. При реализации этой части урока я столкнулась с тем, что не все ученики могли активно участвовать в эксперименте одновременно, что показало мне значимость более тщательного планирования групповых и индивидуальных заданий.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>В ходе урока я также обнаружила, что понятие “сопротивление” оказалось сложным для понимания некоторыми учениками. Чтобы адресовать этот вопрос, я организовала дополнительное объяснение с использованием аналогий и еще несколько примеров из жизни, что, на мой взгляд, помогло учащимся лучше охватить тему.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Осознавая важность мотивации учащихся, я старалась поощрять активное участие и положительно реагировала на любые попытки ответов или вопросы. Это помогло создать поддерживающую атмосферу, в которой ученики не боялись проявить инициативу.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>В заключение, анализируя урок, я осознаю, что могла бы использовать разнообразие методов обучения еще шире, включая игры и кроссворды для закрепления теоретических понятий. Также мне стоит больше внимания уделить организации практической работы таким образом, чтобы каждый ученик получил возможность активно участвовать в эксперименте.<br/>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Этот опыт показал мне, что даже хорошо спланированный урок может столкнуться с непредвиденными сложностями и что важно быть готовым ко всему и уметь гибко адаптироваться к обстоятельствам, сохраняя при этом внимание и интерес учеников.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, проводишь классный час для 8 класса по теме: \\"День памяти воинов-интернационалистов\\", напиши планируемые результаты проведения этого классного часаASSISTANT: Планируемые результаты проведения классного часа для 8 класса по теме “День памяти воинов-интернационалистов”:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Формирование уважительного отношения к истории своей страны:</strong> Учащиеся смогут глубже понять значение и трагизму конфликтов, в которых участвовали воины-интернационалисты, и их вклад в историю.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Развитие навыков коллективной работы и взаимопомощи:</strong> Планируется вовлечение учащихся в подготовку докладов, презентаций, и художественных номеров, что способствует укреплению духа товарищества и командной работы.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Расширение кругозора:</strong> Учащиеся получат знания о событиях, которые оказывали значительное влияние на мировую историю, а также о зоне конфликтов, их причинах и последствиях.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Воспитание чувства патриотизма:</strong> Обсуждение темы и участие в планировании мероприятий должны способствовать воспитанию гражданственности и патриотизма, осознанию значения героизма и самопожертвования в истории страны.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Развитие эмоциональной восприимчивости:</strong> Через чтение стихов, писем солдат, просмотр документальных отрывков планируется развитие способности сопереживать и выражать свои чувства и мысли по поводу услышанного и увиденного.<br/><br/>6. <strong>Поддержка интереса к изучению истории:</strong> Через участие в интерактивной части, обсуждения, задания на креативное мышление ученики могут обнаружить для себя новые интересные факты и аспекты, поддерживающие их интерес к предмету.<br/><br/>7. <strong>Формирование критического мышления:</strong> Анализ различных исторических источников, сопоставление фактов, обсуждение в классе помогут ученикам научиться критически осмысливать информацию, выделять главное и делать выводы.<br/><br/>8. <strong>Развитие коммуникативных навыков:</strong> Планируемые дискуссии, доклады, презентации позволят ученикам развить навыки публичного выступления, улучшить способности к аргументации своей точки зрения и вежливому общению.<br/><br/>В итоге, классный час должен способствовать формированию комплексного восприятия исторических событий, развитию социально значимых качеств личности и стимулированию активной жизненной позиции учащихся.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, проводишь классный час для 8 класса по теме: \\"День памяти воинов-интернационалистов\\", напиши подробный ход урока.Пропиши слова и деятельность учителя, так же деятельность учениковASSISTANT: <strong>Ход классного часа по теме “День памяти воинов-интернационалистов” для 8 класса</strong><br/><br/><strong>Введение (5 минут)</strong><br/>- <strong>Учитель:</strong> “Добрый день, ребята.

Поскольку плоскость ориентирована в направлении вектора (vec{k}), поток будет равен интегралу компоненты векторного поля в направлении (vec{k}) по заданной области. В данной задаче нас интересует третья компонента векторного поля, потому что она соответствует направлению (vec{k}), то есть (F_k = z^2 + x^2). Однако, поскольку интегрирование происходит через плоскость Oxy, значение (z) на этой плоскости равно 0, и тогда (F_k = x^2). Таким образом, поток векторного поля через заданную поверхность равен: [ Phi = iint limits_{S} vec{F} cdot dvec{S} = iint limits_{S} (x^2 + y^2) dz = iint limits_{D} x^2 , dA ] Где (D) — это проекция интересующей нас области на плоскость Oxy, которая в данном случае представляет собой круг радиусом 1 с центром в начале координат. Переходим к полярным координатам для удобства вычисления интеграла: [ x^2 = r^2 cos^2(theta), quad dA = r, dr, dtheta ] [ Phi = int limits_{0}^{2pi} int limits_{0}^{1} r^3 cos^2(theta) , dr , dtheta ] Вычисляем интегралы последовательно: [ Phi = int limits_{0}^{2pi} cos^2(theta) , dtheta int limits_{0}^{1} r^3 , dr = left( int limits_{0}^{2pi} frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2} dtheta right) left( frac{r^4}{4} Big|_{0}^{1} right) ] [ Phi_1 = frac{1}{4} left[ left( frac{1}{2} theta + frac{1}{4} sin(2theta) right) Bigg|_{0}^{2pi}right] times 1^4 = frac{1}{4} left[ pi right] = frac{pi}{4} ] Таким образом, поток векторного поля (vec{a}) через данную поверхность равен (frac{pi}{4})."},{"prompt":"Phone сalls are than e-mail.

error during a data import session when trying to import data into a system from an Excel file (`export1.xlsx`). The error messages you shared indicate issues with the mapping configuration, specifically concerning the mapping of certain attributes to an \'EntityLink\' type which appears to be not supported or incorrectly set up in your import configuration. Each of the error messages indicates a problem with an attribute\'s \'AttributeType\', stating that it has been incorrectly set to \'EntityLink\'. This problem appears across multiple attributes in two main object classes - \'Линия\' and \'Проектная потребность\'. # How to Resolve the Import Session Error: 1. **Review AttributeType Settings**: Go through the mapping configuration for the import operation, especially focusing on the attributes mentioned in the error messages. The \'AttributeType\' for each of these needs to be correctly defined according to the expected input format and data relationship. 2. **Correct the AttributeType**: For each of the attributes mentioned in the error logs, correct the \'AttributeType\' to the appropriate value that matches what your system expects. If \'EntityLink\' is not a supported type for these attributes, you might need to choose a different type that correctly represents the data relationship and format these attributes should have. 3. **Consult Documentation**: If available, consult the documentation of the system or API you are importing data into. The documentation might provide specific instructions on how to map attribute types, especially for complex relationships like links to other entities. 4. **Contact Support**: If after reviewing the documentation and attempting to correct the mapping issues you still experience problems, consider reaching out to the support team of the system or software you\'re working with. There might be specific constraints or requirements for the import process not clearly documented. 5. **Test with a Subset of Data**: If possible, create a smaller or simplified version of your Excel file and attempt to import it after applying the fixes. This can help you identify if the issue was fully resolved or if there are other underlying issues without having to process the entire dataset. Remember, the key here is to ensure that each attribute\'s \'AttributeType\' is correctly set up to match the data structure and relationships expected by the system you are importing data into. This will likely resolve the import session errors you have encountered."},{"prompt":"response

This suggests that the data format in these cells does not match the expected numeric format. # Steps to Resolve the Issue: 1. **Review and Correct Data in Excel**: - Open the `export1.xlsx` file and navigate to column \'S\'. - Check rows 3 and 4 for any non-numeric characters or formatting issues that might prevent the system from recognizing them as numeric values. This can include spaces, commas in place of decimal points (or vice versa, depending on locale settings), or any non-numeric characters. - Correct the data format to ensure these cells contain clean numeric values. 2. **Confirm Data Consistency**: - Review adjacent rows and cells in column \'S\' to ensure consistency in data formatting. - If the file contains similar data formats that might cause issues, correct them according to the expected numeric format. 3. **Save and Re-import**: - After making the necessary corrections, save the Excel file. - Attempt to re-import the file into the system. 4. **Check Import Settings**: - Ensure the import settings on the system expecting the data match the format provided in the Excel file. For instance, if the system expects a decimal point but your Excel file uses a comma for decimal notation, this discrepancy can cause import failure. 5. **Locale Settings**: - Sometimes, issues like these arise from differences in locale settings between the system generating/exporting the Excel file and the system importing it. Ensure both systems align on using either dot (.) or comma (,) as the decimal separator. 6. **Seek Support if Necessary**: - If you\'ve made the necessary corrections but continue to encounter issues, it may be helpful to contact support for the software you\'re using to import this data. They might provide additional insights specific to their software or even suggest a workaround. By closely examining and modifying the data in the problematic cells, you can resolve the issue preventing the successful import of your Excel file."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Reason becomes a matter of efficiency, ‘the optimum adaptation of means to ends’ (Horkheimer 1978b, p. 28). Reason, in other words, becomes instrumental reason, a means to achieve an end rather than a scrutiny or critique of the end itself. Reification involves the loss of meaning, or rather meaning becomes the purely formal process of measuring means to an end. Nuclear destruction is the outcome of rational thought. It is when judged by such rationality that our scream appears irrational. The formalisation of reason is at the same time the separation of what is from what ought to be. Rational thought is now concerned with what is and its rational (efficient) ordering. This means not the elimination of ‘ought’ but its separation from ‘is’: what is is one thing and what ought to be another. Most people would agree that there ought to be no children forced to live on the streets, but (so the argument goes) the reality is different. The study of society, whether it be sociology, politics, economics or whatever ‘discipline’ of social science, is the study of what is. The question of what ought to be may be interesting too, but we must not blur the distinction between the two, we must not confuse reality with dreams. As long as they are kept separate, there is no problem. Moralistic reasoning about what ought to be, far from undermining what is, actually reinforces it: the ‘ought’ presupposes an existing reality to which the category of ‘ought’ remains inapplicable in principle. Whenever the refusal of the subject simply to accept his empirically given existence takes the form of an ‘ought’, this means that the immediately given empirical reality receives affirmation and consecration at the hands of philosophy: it is philosophically immortalised. [Lukács 1971, p. 160] To the extent that there really is a formal abstraction of social relations, those relations can be understood as being governed by laws, and it becomes possible to speak of the ‘laws of capitalist development’. The owners of capital do not control capitalist society. Rather, they too are subject to the laws of capitalist development, laws which reflect the separation of the doer from the doing, the autonomy of the doing. The most that people can do is adapt themselves to these ‘laws’ which they do not control: man in capitalist society confronts a reality ‘made’ by himself (as a class) which appears to him to be a natural phenomenon alien to himself; he is wholly at the mercy of its ‘laws’, his activity is confined to the exploitation of the inexorable fulfilment of certain individual laws for his own (egoistic) interests. But even while ‘acting’ he remains, in the nature of the case, the object and not the subject of events. [Lukács 1971, p. 135] Freedom, in this context, becomes simply knowledge of and subordination to the laws, the acceptance of necessity.28 The law-bound nature of capitalist society, then, and the possibility of the scientific study of these laws is nothing other than an expression of the fact that doers do not control their doing and that ‘all human relations … assume increasingly the objective forms of the abstract elements of the conceptual systems of natural science and of the abstract substrata of the laws of nature’ (Lukács, 1971, p. 131). VIII The argument could go on and on. The point is that at the basis of an immensely complex social structure lies a simple principle – identity. The principle of identity is so basic to capitalist social organisation that to underline its importance seems absolutely meaningless, simply because it seems so obvious. And yet it is not so obvious. The idea that someone is x without the simultaneous realisation that she is not x is rooted in something that is very far from obvious: namely, the daily repeated separation of done from doing, the daily repeated seizure from the doers of the product of their doing and its definition as the property of someone else. This very real, very material identification (this thing is mine, not yours) spreads like a crack into every aspect of our social organisation and every aspect of our consciousness. Identity is the antithesis of mutual recognition, of community, friendship and love.29 If I say that ‘I am x’, it implies that my being x does not depend on anyone else, that it does not depend on anyone else’s recognition. I stand alone, my relations with other people are quite peripheral to my being. Social recognition is something that stands outside me, something that comes through the market when I can sell my product or sell my own capacity to do things at a higher price (promotion, for example). Other people are just that, other. Seen through the prism of identity, relations between people are external. As Bublitz (1998, pp. 34ff) points out in her discussion of Aristotle, friendship and love are impossible to conceptualise on the basis of a formal logic of identity. There can be no mutual recognition, no recognition of ourselves in others, of others in ourselves. From an identitarian perspective, the ‘we’ with which we started can be no more than an arbitrary sack of potatoes, or else a false (and threatening) chumminess with no real basis. There is no room there for the mutual inter-penetration of existence which we experience as friendship or love. Enmity, on the other hand, is easy to understand: the other is the other. The other is not part of us and we are not part of the other.30 It is clear that the process of identification is not external to us. We are active in the process of identifying or reifying social relations, just as we are active in producing the done which is turned against our doing. There is no innocent subject. Power-over reaches into us and transforms us, forcing us to participate actively in its reproduction. The rigidification of social relations, the that’s-the-way-things-areness that confronts our scream is not just outside us (in society), but reaches into us as well, into the way that we think, the way we act, the way we are, the fact that we are. In the process of being separated from our done and from our doing, we ourselves are damaged. Our activity is transformed into passivity, our will to do things is transformed into greed for money, our cooperation with fellow-doers is transformed into an instrumental relation mediated by money or competition. The innocence of our doing, of our power-to, becomes a guilty participation in the exercise of power-over. Our estrangement from doing is a self-estrangement. Here is no pure, eager revolutionary subject, but damaged humanity. We are all deeply involved in the construction of identitarian reality, and this process is the construction of ourselves. The reality that confronts us reaches into us. What we scream against is not just out there, it is also inside us. It seems to invade all of us, to become us. That is what makes our scream so anguished, so desperate. That too is what makes our scream seem so hopeless. At times it seems that our scream itself is the only fissure of hope. Reality, the reality of capital, seems completely inescapable. As Marcuse puts it: … the unfree individual introjects his masters and their commands into his own mental apparatus. The struggle against freedom reproduces itself in the psyche of man, as the self-repression of the repressed individual, and his self-repression in turn sustains his masters and their institutions. [1998, p. 16] This introjection of our masters is the introjection of an identitarian, alienated reality (theorised by Freud as an absolute, biologically determined reality rather than a historically specific form of reality), to which we subordinate our pursuit of pleasure.31 Reification, therefore, refers not just to the rule of the object but to the creation of a peculiarly dislocated subject. The separation of doer from doing and done creates a doer who is cut adrift from doing, who is subordinate to the done, but appears to be completely independent of it. The separation of people from the social tapestry of doing constitutes them as free individuals, free not only in the double sense indicated by Marx, namely free from personal bondage and free of access to the means of survival, but free also from responsibility to the community and free from a sense of meaningful participation in the collective doing. While our discussion has shown that the fracture of doing means that the subject too is fractured (alienated, anguished, damaged), the subject of bourgeois theory is an innocent, healthy, freely self-determining individual: admittedly, certain individuals have psychological problems, but they are just personal problems, nothing to do with the social schizophrenia that cuts through every aspect of our existence. The more subordination to the done is taken for granted, the more free the individual subject appears. The more thoroughly identification is established as something that is simply beyond question, beyond thought, the freer the society appears. The more profoundly unfree we are, the more liberated we appear to be. The illusory freedom of the citizen is the counterpart of the illusory community of the state. We live in a free society, don’t we? No wonder our scream is so violent. We have, then, two concepts of the subject. The subject of bourgeois theory is the free individual, whereas the subjectivity that has been central to our account is a collective subjectivity rent asunder by the tearing of doing from done, an atomised subject damaged to our depths. The subject of bourgeois theory does not scream, while our subject screams to high heaven, not because of any particularity, just because of our sundered subjectivity. For bourgeois theory, subjectivity is identity, whereas in our argument, subjectivity is the negation of identity. There is no doubt that the first concept, that of the innocent, wholesome, subject, has often been transferred by some currents in Marxist theory to the notion of the working class. Soviet images of the heroic working class come to mind, but the image of the heroic revolutionary goes far beyond the Soviet experience. It is in this context that it becomes possible to understand the concern of some theorists (structuralists, post-structuralists, postmodernists) to attack the notion of the subject. Much of what is seen as an attack on subjectivity is simply an attack on identity, on the bourgeois identification of subjectivity with identity. Thus, for example, when Foucault speaks of (and analyses in detail) the ‘immense work to which the West has set generations to produce … the subjection of men; I mean their constitution as “subjects” in both senses of the word’ (1990, p. 60), then this is surely correct in relation to the constitution of the ‘free’ subject of capitalist society, who is indeed subject in both senses of the word. To identify the bourgeois subject with subjectivity as a whole, however, is a most murderous throwing of the baby out with the bathwater. To confound subjectivity with identity and criticise subjectivity in an attempt to attack identity leads only to a total impasse, since subjectivity, as movement, as negation of is-ness, is the only possible basis for going beyond identity, and therefore beyond the bourgeois subject.32 ”翻译为中文","completion":"理性与理解分离，思想与存在分离。理性变成了效率的问题，“手段与目的的最优适配”（霍克海默，1978b，第28页）。换句话说，理性变成了工具理性，成为实现目的的手段，而不是对目的本身的审视或批判。物化意味着失去意义，或者说意义变成了衡量手段与目的的纯形式过程。核毁灭是理性思维的结果。正是通过这样的理性判断，我们的尖叫显得不合理。 理性的形式化同时也是存在与应当之间的分离。理性思维现在关注的是现实及其理性（高效）的排序。这意味着不是消除“应当”，而是将其与“现实”分离：现实是一回事，应当是另一回事。大多数人都会同意，孩子们不应该被迫生活在街头，但（所以这个论点的逻辑是）现实是不同的。无论是社会学、政治学、经济学还是任何社会科学的“学科”，都是对现实的研究。对“应当是什么”的问题也许也很有趣，但我们不能混淆两者，我们不能将现实与梦想混为一谈。只要它们被保持分离，就没有问题。关于应当怎样的道德推理，远非削弱现实，实际上是对它的加强： “应当”预设了一个存在的现实状态，而“应当”的范畴原则上不适用于此。每当主体拒绝简单接受他的经验性给定存在，采取“应当”的形式时，即意味着经验性给定的现实得到了哲学的肯定和圣化：它在哲学上被永久化了。[卢卡奇，1971，第160页] 在社会关系真正形成形式抽象的情况下，人们可以理解这些关系是受法律支配的，并且成为可能讨论“资本主义发展的法则”。资本的拥有者并不控制资本主义社会。相反，他们也受到资本主义发展法则的制约，这些法则反映了行为者与行为、行为的自主性的分离。人们所能做的最多就是适应这些他们无法控制的“法则”： 在资本主义社会中，人面对一个他（作为一个阶级）自己“造成”的现实，这个现实对他来说是一个外来的自然现象；他完全受制于它的“法则”，他的活动限于利用某些个别法则的必然实现，以追求自己的（自私的）利益。但即使在“行动”时，他在本质上仍是事件的对象而非主体。[卢卡奇，1971，第135页] 在这种背景下，自由简单地变成了对法则的认识和顺从，接受必然性。因此，资本主义社会的法律束缚特性，以及科学研究这些法则的可能性，只不过是行为者不控制他们行为的事实，以及“所有人类关系……越来越多地呈现为自然科学的概念系统抽象元素和自然法则抽象基础的客观形式”的表达。[卢卡奇，1971，第131页] 八 论点可以无休止地展开。关键是在一个极其复杂的社会结构的基础上，有一个简单的原则——同一性。资本主义社会组织中同一性的原则如此基本，以至于强调它的重要性似乎完全毫无意义，仅仅因为它看起来如此显而易见。然而，它并非那么明显。没有同时实现她不是x的认识，某人是x，这种观念根植于一些非常不明显的东西：即每天重复的行为与成果的分离，每天重复从行为者那里夺走他们行为的成果并将其定义为别人的财产。这种非常现实、非常具体的认同（这东西是我的，不是你的）如裂缝一样蔓延到我们社会组织的每一个方面和我们意识的每一个方面。 同一性是相互认可、社区、友谊和爱的对立面。如果我说“我是x”，它意味着我的x身份不依赖于其他任何人，不依赖于其他任何人的认可。我独立存在，我与其他人的关系对我的存在相当外围。社会认可是一种站在我外面的东西，当我可以以更高的价格卖掉我的产品或出卖我自身的能力（例如晋升）时通过市场来实现。其他人就是其他人。通过同一性的棱镜看，人与人之间的关系是外在的。正如布卢比茨（Bublitz，1998，第34页及以下）在讨论亚里士多德时指出的，基于形式逻辑的同一性，友情和爱是不可能概念化的。不可能有相互认可，无法认识到我们自己存在于他人之中，他人存在于我们之中。从同一性的角度来看，“我们”不过是一个任意的马铃薯袋，或者是没有任何实质基础的错误（且威胁性的）亲密关系。在那里没有空间给予我们经验到的作为友情或爱的存在之间的相互渗透。另一方面，敌意很容易理解：另一个就是另一个。另一个不是我们的一部分，我们也不是另一个的一部分。 很明显，认同的过程并不是外在于我们。在识别或物化社会关系的过程中，就像我们在生产用来反对我们行为的成果的过程中一样，我们是积极参与的。没有无辜的主体。权力渗透到我们内部并改变我们，迫使我们积极参与其再生产。社会关系的僵化，我们尖叫声所面对的“事情就是这样”的实质不仅仅在我们外部（在社会中），而且也渗透到我们自身，渗透到我们的思考方式、我们的行为方式、我们的存在方式，我们存在的事实中。在与我们的行为和成果分离的过程中，我们自己也受到了伤害。我们的活动变成了被动性，我们做事的意愿变成了对金钱的贪婪，我们与共事者的合作变成了通过金钱或竞争介导的工具性关系。我们行为的纯真，我们的能动性，变成了对权力行使的有罪参与。我们与行为的疏离是一种自我疏离。这里没有纯粹、渴望革命的主体，而是受损的人性。我们都深深参与了同一性现实的建构，而这个过程就是我们自身的建构。 我们所面对的现实深入到我们内部。我们所反抗的不仅仅在外面，它也在我们里面。它似乎侵入了我们所有人，成为了我们。这就是我们的尖叫如此痛苦、如此绝望的原因。同时，这也是我们的尖叫看似如此无望的原因。有时候，我们的尖叫本身似乎是希望的唯一裂缝。资本的现实似乎完全无法逃避。正如马尔库塞所说： “…不自由的个体将他的主人及其命令内化到他自己的心智结构中。反对自由的斗争在人的心灵中自我复制，作为被压迫者的自我压抑，而他的自我压抑反过来维持了他的主人和他们的制度。”[1998，第16页] 对我们主人的内化就是对同一性、异化现实的内化（由弗洛伊德理论化为绝对的、生物学上决定的现实，而不是历史特定形式的现实），我们在其中将追求快乐置于从属地位。 因此，物化不仅仅指对象的统治，还指一种特殊错位主体的创造。行为者与行为、成果的分离创造了一个与行为脱节、从属于成果但似乎完全独立于它的行为者。将人们与社会行为的编织分离，使他们成为自由个体，不仅是马克思指出的双重意义上的自由，即从个人束缚中解放出来和获得生存手段的自由，还包括对社区的责任和参与集体行为的有意义感觉的自由。尽管我们的讨论已经表明，行为的破裂意味着主体也是破裂的（异化、痛苦、受损），但资产阶级理论的主体是一个无辜的、健康的、自由自主的个体：确实，某些个体有心理问题，但那只是个人问题，与贯穿我们存在的每一个方面的社会分裂无关。从属于成果被认为是理所当然的，个体主体就显得更加自由。同一性作为一个毋庸置疑、毋庸思考的东西被更彻底地建立，社会就显得更加自由。我们越是彻底不自由，就显得越是解放。公民的虚幻自由是国家虚幻社区的对应物。我们生活在一个自由社会中，不是吗？难怪我们的尖叫如此激烈。 因此，我们有了两种关于主体的概念。资产阶级理论的主体是自由个体，而我们论述中的主观性是一个被撕裂的行为与成果、被原子化受损害到我们深处的集体主观性。资产阶级理论的主体不会尖叫，而我们的主体会响亮尖叫，不是因为任何特殊性，只因为我们的主观性被撕裂。对于资产阶级理论来说，主观性是同一性，而在我们的论证中，主观性是对同一性的否定。 毫无疑问，第一个概念，即无辜、健全的主体，经常被马克思主义理论中的某些流派转移到工人阶级的概念上。苏联关于英雄工人阶级的形象浮现于脑海，但英雄革命者的形象远远超出了苏联经验。正是在这种背景下，才有可能理解一些理论家（结构主义者、后结构主义者、后现代主义者）攻击主体概念的关切。许多被视为对主观性攻击的东西只不过是对同一性、对资产阶级将主观性与同一性等同的攻击。因此，例如，当福柯谈论并详细分析了“西方已经让一代又一代人投入到的巨大工作，以产生……人的臣服；我指的是他们作为‘主体’的构建，‘主体’一词的双重意义”（1990，第60页）时，那在与资本主义社会的“自由”主体的构建相关时是正确的，这位“自由”主体确实是双重意义上的主体。然而，将资产阶级主体与主观性整体等同起来，无疑是把婴儿连同洗澡水一起扔掉。将主观性与同一性混淆并批评主观性以试图攻击同一性，只会导致完全的僵局，因为主观性作为运动，作为对是的否定，是超越同一性、因此超越资产阶级主体的唯一可能基础。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Урок был спланирован с учетом возрастных особенностей восьмиклассников, их интересов и предпочтений в методах обучения.<br/><br/>В начале урока мной были заложены цели не только усвоения конкретных знаний о неполных квадратных уравнениях, но и развития логического мышления, а также умения анализировать и строить выводы. Я стремился создать дружелюбную атмосферу, чтобы учащиеся не боялись высказываться и демонстрировать свои знания и сомнения.<br/><br/>Методически урок был построен так, что начался с повторения уже известных фактов о квадратных уравнениях. Это позволило сгладить переход к новой теме. После чего был представлен и разобран новый материал, где я использовал презентацию с наглядными примерами неполных квадратных уравнений и методов их решения.<br/><br/>Большую часть урока я посвятил практике: решению задач вместе с классом и работе учеников в группах и индивидуально. Это позволило мне лучше понять уровень усвоения материала каждым учеником и вовремя предоставить обратную связь или дополнительную помощь тем, кто испытывал трудности.<br/><br/>Однако, в ходе урока я заметил, что некоторым учащимся было сложно сосредоточиться, что, возможно, было вызвано монотонностью моих объяснений. В будущем мне стоит внедрить больше интерактивных и игровых форм работы, чтобы повысить вовлеченность и активность всех учеников.<br/><br/>Также я почувствовал необходимость разнообразить дидактические материалы и задания, делая их более доступными и интересными для разных категорий учеников. Важным аспектом, который я извлек из этого опыта, является понимание того, что поддержка и поощрение со стороны учителя играют большую роль в мотивации учеников.<br/><br/>В конце урока я провел рефлексию, позволив учащимся выразить свое мнение о полученных знаниях и процессе обучения, что дало мне дополнительную обратную связь и понимание того, какие аспекты моего преподавания мне следует улучшить в будущем.<br/><br/>В заключение, хотя урок и был не лишен недостатков, я считаю его ценным опытом, который показал мне направления для дальнейшего профессионального и личностного роста как педагога.USER: Ты студент педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по алгебре 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Неполные квадратные уравнения\\".

Возможно, это было связано с недостаточным использованием игровых элементов и недостаточно четкой структурированностью урока для удержания внимания учащихся.<br/><br/>Также я заметил, что наличие однотипных заданий вызвало у некоторых учеников скуку, что показывает мне необходимость более тщательного подбора и дифференциации заданий в зависимости от интересов и уровня подготовки каждого ученика.<br/><br/>В заключение, этот опыт учебного урока показал мне важность гибкости и адаптивности в подходах к преподаванию. В дальнейшем я планирую использовать разнообразные методы обучения и контроля, более активно вовлекать учащихся в учебный процесс и уделять больше внимания индивидуальным особенностям и потребностям студентов. Этот урок стал важным уроком и для меня лично, подчеркнув необходимость постоянного самосовершенствования в роли учителя.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, напиши самоанализ проведённого урока по физике 8 класса на практике в школе, тема урока: \\"Зависимость силы тока от сопротивления. Электрическое сопротивление проводника\\". Самоанализ напиши в произвольной формеASSISTANT: Самоанализ урока по физике в 8 классе на тему “Зависимость силы тока от сопротивления. Электрическое сопротивление проводника”<br/><br/><br/>Подготовка и проведение урока по этой теме стали для меня важным испытанием моих педагогических и профессиональных навыков. Задача состояла не просто в изложении теоретического материала, но и в том, чтобы сделать урок понятным и интересным для восьмиклассников, с учетом их возрастных особенностей и предварительных знаний.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Урок начался с краткого повторения предыдущих тем по электричеству, чтобы обеспечить плавный переход к новому материалу. Введение в тему “Электрическое сопротивление проводника” было оформлено в форме презентации с визуальными иллюстрациями, которые помогли проиллюстрировать ключевые понятия.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Особое внимание я уделила практическим заданиям и экспериментам, которые позволили учащимся самостоятельно наблюдать зависимость силы тока от сопротивления в цепи. Это придало уроку интерактивность и способствовало лучшему усвоению материала. При реализации этой части урока я столкнулась с тем, что не все ученики могли активно участвовать в эксперименте одновременно, что показало мне значимость более тщательного планирования групповых и индивидуальных заданий.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>В ходе урока я также обнаружила, что понятие “сопротивление” оказалось сложным для понимания некоторыми учениками. Чтобы адресовать этот вопрос, я организовала дополнительное объяснение с использованием аналогий и еще несколько примеров из жизни, что, на мой взгляд, помогло учащимся лучше охватить тему.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Осознавая важность мотивации учащихся, я старалась поощрять активное участие и положительно реагировала на любые попытки ответов или вопросы. Это помогло создать поддерживающую атмосферу, в которой ученики не боялись проявить инициативу.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>В заключение, анализируя урок, я осознаю, что могла бы использовать разнообразие методов обучения еще шире, включая игры и кроссворды для закрепления теоретических понятий. Также мне стоит больше внимания уделить организации практической работы таким образом, чтобы каждый ученик получил возможность активно участвовать в эксперименте.<br/>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>Этот опыт показал мне, что даже хорошо спланированный урок может столкнуться с непредвиденными сложностями и что важно быть готовым ко всему и уметь гибко адаптироваться к обстоятельствам, сохраняя при этом внимание и интерес учеников.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, проводишь классный час для 8 класса по теме: \\"День памяти воинов-интернационалистов\\", напиши планируемые результаты проведения этого классного часаASSISTANT: Планируемые результаты проведения классного часа для 8 класса по теме “День памяти воинов-интернационалистов”:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Формирование уважительного отношения к истории своей страны:</strong> Учащиеся смогут глубже понять значение и трагизму конфликтов, в которых участвовали воины-интернационалисты, и их вклад в историю.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Развитие навыков коллективной работы и взаимопомощи:</strong> Планируется вовлечение учащихся в подготовку докладов, презентаций, и художественных номеров, что способствует укреплению духа товарищества и командной работы.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Расширение кругозора:</strong> Учащиеся получат знания о событиях, которые оказывали значительное влияние на мировую историю, а также о зоне конфликтов, их причинах и последствиях.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Воспитание чувства патриотизма:</strong> Обсуждение темы и участие в планировании мероприятий должны способствовать воспитанию гражданственности и патриотизма, осознанию значения героизма и самопожертвования в истории страны.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Развитие эмоциональной восприимчивости:</strong> Через чтение стихов, писем солдат, просмотр документальных отрывков планируется развитие способности сопереживать и выражать свои чувства и мысли по поводу услышанного и увиденного.<br/><br/>6. <strong>Поддержка интереса к изучению истории:</strong> Через участие в интерактивной части, обсуждения, задания на креативное мышление ученики могут обнаружить для себя новые интересные факты и аспекты, поддерживающие их интерес к предмету.<br/><br/>7. <strong>Формирование критического мышления:</strong> Анализ различных исторических источников, сопоставление фактов, обсуждение в классе помогут ученикам научиться критически осмысливать информацию, выделять главное и делать выводы.<br/><br/>8. <strong>Развитие коммуникативных навыков:</strong> Планируемые дискуссии, доклады, презентации позволят ученикам развить навыки публичного выступления, улучшить способности к аргументации своей точки зрения и вежливому общению.<br/><br/>В итоге, классный час должен способствовать формированию комплексного восприятия исторических событий, развитию социально значимых качеств личности и стимулированию активной жизненной позиции учащихся.USER: Ты студентка педагогического вуза, проводишь классный час для 8 класса по теме: \\"День памяти воинов-интернационалистов\\", напиши подробный ход урока.Пропиши слова и деятельность учителя, так же деятельность учениковASSISTANT: <strong>Ход классного часа по теме “День памяти воинов-интернационалистов” для 8 класса</strong><br/><br/><strong>Введение (5 минут)</strong><br/>- <strong>Учитель:</strong> “Добрый день, ребята.

Поскольку плоскость ориентирована в направлении вектора (vec{k}), поток будет равен интегралу компоненты векторного поля в направлении (vec{k}) по заданной области.<br/><br/>В данной задаче нас интересует третья компонента векторного поля, потому что она соответствует направлению (vec{k}), то есть (F_k = z^2 + x^2). Однако, поскольку интегрирование происходит через плоскость Oxy, значение (z) на этой плоскости равно 0, и тогда (F_k = x^2).<br/><br/>Таким образом, поток векторного поля через заданную поверхность равен:<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = iint limits_{S} vec{F} cdot dvec{S} = iint limits_{S} (x^2 + y^2) dz = iint limits_{D} x^2 , dA<br/>]<br/><br/>Где (D) — это проекция интересующей нас области на плоскость Oxy, которая в данном случае представляет собой круг радиусом 1 с центром в начале координат.<br/><br/>Переходим к полярным координатам для удобства вычисления интеграла:<br/><br/>[<br/>x^2 = r^2 cos^2(theta), quad dA = r, dr, dtheta<br/>]<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = int limits_{0}^{2pi} int limits_{0}^{1} r^3 cos^2(theta) , dr , dtheta<br/>]<br/><br/>Вычисляем интегралы последовательно:<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi = int limits_{0}^{2pi} cos^2(theta) , dtheta int limits_{0}^{1} r^3 , dr = left( int limits_{0}^{2pi} frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2} dtheta right) left( frac{r^4}{4} Big|<em>{0}^{1} right)<br/>]<br/><br/>[<br/>Phi_1 = frac{1}{4} left[ left( frac{1}{2} theta + frac{1}{4} sin(2theta) right) Bigg|</em>{0}^{2pi}right] times 1^4 = frac{1}{4} left[ pi right] = frac{pi}{4}<br/>]<br/><br/>Таким образом, поток векторного поля (vec{a}) через данную поверхность равен (frac{pi}{4}).USER: Вычислить поток векторного поля в цилиндрической системе координат а=(х²+у²) I+(y²+z²) j+(z²+x²)k через часть плоскости Оху, ограниченную окружностью x²+y²=1 (в направлении вектора k)ASSISTANT:","completion":"Для вычисления потока векторного поля (vec{a} = (x^2 + y^2) hat{i} + (y^2 + z^2) hat{j} + (z^2 + x^2) hat{k}) через часть плоскости Oxy, ограниченную окружностью (x^2 + y^2 = 1) (в направлении вектора (hat{k})), необходимо рассчитать поверхностный интеграл второго рода для компоненты (hat{k}) векторного поля. Рассматриваемая область находится на плоскости Oxy, где (z = 0), поэтому компонента векторного поля, ориентированного в направлении (hat{k}), упрощается до (z^2 + x^2). При (z = 0) это выражение упрощается до (x^2). Поверхностный интеграл для этой компоненты векторного поля по заданной области на плоскости Oxy может быть выражен как: [ Phi = iintlimits_{S} (z^2 + x^2) , dS ] При (z = 0), выражение для потока через плоскость Oxy принимает вид: [ Phi = iintlimits_{D} x^2 , dA ] где (D) обозначает область на плоскости Oxy, ограниченную окружностью (x^2 + y^2 = 1). Для выполнения интеграции удобно перейти к полярным координатам, где (dA = r , dr , dtheta), и (x = r cos(theta)). Таким образом, интеграл преобразуется к виду: [ Phi = int_{0}^{2pi} int_{0}^{1} (r^2 cos^2(theta))r , dr , dtheta ] Выполнение интеграции по (r) дает: [ int_{0}^{1} r^3 , dr = frac{1}{4}r^4 Big|_0^1 = frac{1}{4} ] Тогда: [ Phi = frac{1}{4} int_{0}^{2pi} cos^2(theta) , dtheta ] Используя тригонометрическую идентичность (cos^2(theta) = frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2}), интеграл по (theta) равен: [ int_{0}^{2pi} frac{1 + cos(2theta)}{2} , dtheta = pi ] Следовательно, поток (vec{a}) через часть плоскости Oxy, ограниченную окружностью (x^2 + y^2 = 1), равен [ Phi = frac{pi}{4} times pi = frac{pi^2}{4} ] Таким образом, поток векторного поля через заданную поверхность равен (frac{pi^2}{4})."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Methods like `OnStartInteract` and `OnEndInteract` set this flag to `true` and `false` respectively, indicating whether an interaction is currently happening. 2. **`VirutalUpdate` Method:** The `VirutalUpdate` method (which seems to be a typo and should probably be `VirtualUpdate` for consistency) is called every frame from the `Update` method in the base class. This method is crucial for checking continuous or frame-based logic that isn\'t directly tied to a one-time event like starting or ending an interaction. 3. **Right Mouse Button Checks:** Based on your design, `OnPress`, which includes checks for mouse button inputs, is called inside `VirutalUpdate` but only when an interaction is ongoing (`Interacting` is `true`). This design implies that `OnPress` (and therefore checks for both left and right mouse buttons) are intended to occur *during* an interaction, which might not align with standard mouse input expectations—especially for something that seems designed to react to mouse clicks. **Diagnosing the Right-Click Issue:** - **Interaction State Requirement:** If the right mouse button doesn\'t seem to respond, one critical question is whether these mouse checks should depend on the `Interacting` state. Is the intention for the right mouse click to only have an effect during an existing touch interaction? Or should it have a broader response, not limited to touch interactions? - **Event Triggering Conditions:** Given the current structure, right-click interactions will only be recognized if they occur *after* a touch interaction has started and before it ends, which might not be intuitive for users or fitting for your game\'s UI/UX design. **Suggestions for Improvement:** 1. **Reevaluate Input Checks:** If the goal is for the mouse clicks to be recognized more broadly (not just during touch interactions), you might consider moving mouse input checks to another method that doesn\'t depend on the `Interacting` flag. 2. **Distinguish Touch vs. Mouse Interactions:** If your game/app targets both touch devices and platforms where a mouse is used, it\'s crucial to design your interaction handling to accommodate both touch interactions and mouse clicks appropriately, possibly treating them as separate interaction paradigms. 3. **Debugging Inputs:** Add debug logs in strategic places: at the start of your `VirutalUpdate` method, inside your mouse button checks, and within event callbacks to ensure that methods are being entered as expected and that interaction states are correctly managed. 4. **Correct Typo:** Consider correcting the typo from `VirutalUpdate` to `VirtualUpdate` for consistency and readability. 5. **Direct Update Checks:** For critical inputs like mouse clicks that should always be responsive, performing checks directly in the `Update` method or similar consistently running methods without restrictive conditions could ensure responsiveness. By revisiting the assumptions about when and how user inputs should be handled and potentially adjusting your logic to better match the usage scenarios you envision, you should be able to resolve the issue with the right mouse button not responding as expected."},{"prompt":"确实是在右键的时候 Interacting == false，是为什么呢","completion":"如果在尝试用鼠标右键点击时`Interacting == false`，问题可能在于您和用户之间的交互流程设计。基于您提供的代码，`Interacting`标志位是在`OnStartInteract`方法开始时设置为`true`，并在`OnEndInteract`方法结束时被设置回`false`。如果这些方法仅通过触摸事件（`Touch`）来触发，这就意味着： 1. **触摸交互限定**：`Interacting`变量目前只在触摸交互时更改其状态。这种设计模式意味着鼠标输入（包括右键点击）不会改变`Interacting`的状态，除非它们也被明确设计为触发`OnStartInteract`和`OnEndInteract`方法。 2. **特定输入响应**：在多数情况下，游戏和应用程序会区分触摸输入和鼠标输入，尤其是在旨在同时支持触屏设备和非触屏设备（如PC）的项目中。如果您打算让应用程序或游戏响应鼠标点击（特别是右键点击），则需确保逻辑上正确处理不同类型的用户输入。 3. **改善建议**： - **全面检测输入**：最直接的解决方式是在`VirutalUpdate`（应为`VirtualUpdate`，建议修正这个错别字）或`Update`方法中不依赖于`Interacting`状态来检测鼠标点击。这意味着即便没有触摸交互发生时，鼠标的点击也能被检测并响应。 - **更新交互状态管理**：如果您想要让`Interacting`真实反映用户是否正在交互，包括使用鼠标进行的交互，那么可以考虑添加鼠标事件的监听来相应地更新`Interacting`的状态。例如，在检测到鼠标按钮按下时调用`OnStartInteract`，并在释放时调用`OnEndInteract`（可能需要重载这些方法以适应不同输入类型，如触摸和鼠标）。 - **增加鼠标输入处理**：为了让`Interactable`基类更加通用，可以考虑为鼠标点击单独实现一套逻辑处理，或者是在现有的方法中添加判断来同时支持触摸输入和鼠标输入。 通过上述改进，您不仅能够确保鼠标右键点击在任何情况下都有响应，还能提升用户交互体验的连贯性和一致性，不论是通过触摸屏还是通过鼠标进行交互。"},{"prompt":"using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; public class Interactable : MonoBehaviour { public bool Interacting; public virtual void ClearInteractableEvents() { } public virtual void OnStartInteract(Touch touch) { Interacting = true; } public virtual void OnEndInteract(Touch touch, bool canceled = false) { Interacting = false; } public virtual void OnInteract(Touch touch) { } protected virtual void VirutalUpdate() { // 检测鼠标左键按下 if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { Debug.Log(\\"左键\\"); } // 检测鼠标右键按下 if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1)) { Debug.Log(\\"油煎\\"); } } protected virtual void VirtualStart() { } private void Start() { VirtualStart(); } private void Update() { VirutalUpdate(); } } 改成这样后，必须要先按左键才能使右键有反应是为啥呢","completion":"若您发现必须先按下鼠标左键（0）才能使鼠标右键（1）有反应，基于您描述的情况和代码片段，实际上不应有这种行为：`Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)`和`Input.GetMouseButtonDown(1)`调用是独立的，理应互不干扰。这两个方法都在Unity的`Update()`方法中通过`VirutalUpdate()`检查，且检查是并列进行，无条件依赖于彼此。 如果您遇到必须先触发左键点击才能使右键事件被捕获的情况，可能的原因并非源于Unity的输入系统本身，而是其他外部因素或代码逻辑问题。以下是一些可能的问题和解决方案： # 1. 外部软件干扰 确保没有其他软件（如宏程序或输入设备管理器）影响或修改了您的鼠标输入。 # 2. 代码逻辑错误 虽然在给出的代码片段中没有看到此类问题，但请查看其他地方的代码，确认没有逻辑上依赖于左键点击状态的条件判断导致了此问题。 # 3.

Despite their popularity, the excessive consumption of soft drinks has been associated with various negative health outcomes, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (Malik et al., 2013; Park et al., 2020). Nursing students, who often face high levels of stress and academic demands, may be particularly susceptible to turning to soft drinks as a coping mechanism. However, the implications of soft drink consumption on the health and well-being of nursing students remain underexplored. Gender has been identified as a significant factor influencing dietary behaviors and consumption patterns, including the intake of soft drinks. Research has shown that gender disparities exist in soft drink consumption, with male individuals typically consuming more soft drinks compared to their female counterparts (Larson et al., 2021). Understanding these gender differences in soft drink consumption among nursing students is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote healthier dietary habits and prevent negative health outcomes within this population. Despite the known health risks associated with excessive soft drink consumption and the observed gender differences in consumption patterns, there is a noticeable gap in quantitative research specifically focused on the knowledge and practices of soft drinks among nursing students and the associations with gender differences in this context. Thus, this study aims to fill this gap by examining the knowledge and practices of soft drink consumption among nursing students quantitatively and investigating the potential gender disparities in soft drink consumption within this population. By quantitatively analyzing the associations between soft drink consumption, gender, and health outcomes among nursing students, this research aims to provide valuable insights that can inform evidence-based interventions to promote healthy behaviors and mitigate the negative health consequences of excessive soft drink consumption among nursing students. Through this research, we seek to contribute to the existing literature on soft drink consumption and gender disparities, specifically within the context of nursing students, ultimately aiming to enhance the health and well-being of this population.

Soft drinks are typically high in added sugars and calories, which can contribute to weight gain, obesity, and various chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders (Malik et al., 2013). Nursing students, in particular, experience high levels of stress and pressure due to their rigorous academic curriculum and clinical responsibilities. This stress may lead them to adopt unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as consuming high-calorie and sugary beverages like soft drinks. The demanding nature of their training program, which often includes long hours of study and clinical practice, may further exacerbate the tendency to rely on unhealthy dietary habits. Gender has been identified as a significant determinant of dietary behaviors and food choices, including soft drink consumption. Research has consistently shown that gender disparities exist in the consumption of soft drinks, with males being more likely to consume higher amounts of SSBs compared to females (Larson et al., 2021). These gender differences in consumption patterns may be influenced by various factors, including taste preferences, social norms, and perceived stress levels among male and female individuals. Despite the known health risks associated with excessive soft drink consumption and the observed gender differences in consumption patterns, there is a lack of quantitative research specifically focused on understanding the knowledge and practices of soft drink consumption among nursing students. Exploring the associations between soft drink consumption, gender, and health outcomes within this population is essential for developing targeted interventions to promote healthier dietary habits and prevent negative health consequences.

The consumption of soft drinks has been linked to various negative health outcomes, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and dental issues (Malik et al., 2013). The high sugar content and empty calories in soft drinks make them a major contributor to the rising rates of obesity and related health conditions worldwide. Studies have consistently shown a strong association between soft drink consumption and weight gain. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Malik et al. (2013) found a positive correlation between SSB consumption and increased body weight in both children and adults. The high sugar content in soft drinks leads to a rapid spike in blood sugar levels, promoting fat storage and contributing to the development of obesity over time. Among college students, including nursing students, soft drink consumption is a common behavior that may be influenced by various factors, including stress, peer influences, and convenience. Nursing students, in particular, face high levels of academic pressure and demanding clinical responsibilities, which may contribute to increased consumption of soft drinks as a coping mechanism. The availability and accessibility of soft drinks on college campuses further facilitate their consumption among students. Gender disparities in soft drink consumption have also been documented in the literature. Larson et al. (2021) conducted a study on young adults and found that male college students were more likely to consume soft drinks compared to their female counterparts. These gender differences in consumption patterns may be influenced by taste preferences, social norms, and cultural factors that shape dietary behaviors differently among males and females.

Né en 1859 et décédé en 1947, il était très respecté pour sa foi profonde et les miracles qui, selon des témoignages, se sont produits à travers son service. Voici quelques-uns des miracles et prodiges qui lui sont attribués, selon les récits collectés de ceux qui ont assisté à son ministère ou les ont lus dans des enregistrements historiques et biographies : 1. **Guérisons**: Wigglesworth est peut-être le plus célèbre pour les nombreuses guérisons rapportées lors de ses réunions. Des personnes atteintes de diverses maladies et conditions, y compris des cas jugés incurables par la médecine de l\'époque, auraient été guéries. Cela inclut des maladies comme le cancer, la tuberculose, des problèmes de vue et d\'audition, et même des cas de paralysie. 2. **Résurrections**: Wigglesworth aurait prié pour plusieurs personnes qui étaient mortes, qui seraient revenues à la vie. Dans ses biographies, il est mention de plusieurs cas où, après sa prière de foi, des personnes déclarées mortes auraient été miraculeusement ramenées à la vie. 3. **Expulsions de démons**: Il est crédité d\'avoir eu un ministère puissant de délivrance, avec de nombreux témoignages de personnes libérées d\'esprits maléfiques ou de possessions démoniaques après ses prières. 4. **Parole de connaissance et prophéties**: Wigglesworth aurait eu un don spirituel lui permettant de connaître des détails sur les personnes ou des situations qu\'il n\'aurait pas pu savoir naturellement. De plus, plusieurs de ses prophéties concernant l\'avenir de l\'Église et du monde auraient été respectées. Ces récits sont tirés de témoignages personnels, des comptes rendus de réunions et écrits biographiques sur la vie de Wigglesworth. Il est important de noter que, comme pour tout récit historique basé sur des témoignages, l\'exactitude et l\'interprétation peuvent varier selon la source. La vie et le ministère de Smith Wigglesworth continuent d\'être une source d\'inspiration pour beaucoup dans le christianisme charismatique et pentecôtiste, bien que ses pratiques et croyances soient vues de manière diverse à travers le spectre chrétien."},{"prompt":"Qu\'avait il annoncé concernant l\'avenir du monde ?","completion":"Smith Wigglesworth est célèbre pour avoir fait plusieurs déclarations prophétiques concernant l\'avenir de l\'Église et du monde. Parmi celles-ci, l\'une des plus célèbres est sa prédiction concernant des \\"vagues\\" successives de réveil spirituel et de mouvements du Saint-Esprit. Bien que les détails spécifiques puissent varier selon les sources, voici une synthèse générale de sa vision : # Vision des \\"Quatre Vagues\\" de Wigglesworth 1. **Première vague** : Il a parlé d\'un réveil impliquant le retour au salut par la foi en Jésus-Christ, soulignant un mouvement vers la repentance et un intérêt renouvelé pour les enseignements bibliques sur le salut. Cette vague s\'est largement réalisée à travers les réveils pentecôtistes du début du 20e siècle. 2. **Deuxième vague** : La suivante serait caractérisée par un renouveau du Saint-Esprit, avec des dons spirituels tels que les langues, les prophéties, et les guérisons miracles devenant plus communs parmi les croyants. Cela a été interprété comme se référant au mouvement charismatique qui a pris de l\'ampleur dans les années 1960 et au-delà, touchant de nombreuses dénominations chrétiennes traditionnelles. 3. **Troisième vague** : Wigglesworth a prophétisé une troisième vague de réveil qui allierait les éléments des deux premières, mais avec une puissance et une portée accrues. Il a parlé d\'un mouvement où la parole de foi et les miracles se produiraient quotidiennement, attirant des masses vers Dieu. 4. **Quatrième vague** : La dernière vague qu\'il a vue était celle d\'un réveil de la fin des temps qui surpasserait tout ce qui avait été vu auparavant, où l\'Église serait unie dans un pouvoir sans précédent pour répandre l\'Évangile dans le monde entier, précédant le retour du Christ. # Autres Prophéties Bien que cette vision des \\"quatre vagues\\" soit parmi les plus citées, Wigglesworth aurait également fait d\'autres déclarations prophétiques concernant des challenges et des persécutions à venir pour l\'Église, ainsi que des promesses de rénovation et de puissance divine en réponse à la fidélité des croyants. Il convient de noter que l\'interprétation et la réalisation de ces prophéties peuvent être vues différemment par les individus et les dénominations au sein du christianisme. Comme toujours avec les prophéties, il est recommandé de les évaluer à la lumière de la Bible et de rester ouvert à la direction du Saint-Esprit."},{"prompt":"6 I\'m trying to proxy a request to a backend with Next rewrites. next.config.js: async rewrites() { return [ { source: \\"/api/:path*\\", destination: \\"http://somedomain.loc/api/:path*\\", }, ] }, /etc/host: 127.0.0.1 somedomain.loc and in the end i get this error: Failed to proxy http://somedomain.loc/api/offers Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:80 at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1159:16) { errno: -111, code: \'ECONNREFUSED\', syscall: \'connect\', address: \'127.0.0.1\', port: 80 } error - Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:80 at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1159:16) { errno: -111, code: \'ECONNREFUSED\', syscall: \'connect\', address: \'127.0.0.1\', port: 80 } While if you make a request via postman or directly from the browser, everything works fine. Please help me understand what is the problem here. tried: Proxy request to backend expected: The request is proxied to the backend as a result: Proxy error","completion":"The error you\'re encountering, `ECONNREFUSED`, suggests that the attempt to connect to the server at `somedomain.loc` (which resolves to `127.0.0.1`, i.e., localhost) on port 80 was refused. This typically means that no process is listening on the requested port (80 in this case) to handle the incoming connection. Here are several possible reasons and solutions for your situation: 1. **Backend Server Not Running**: Ensure that the backend server you\'re trying to proxy requests to is running on the expected port (80 in this scenario). If it\'s running on a different port, you need to update the `destination` in your `next.config.js` file accordingly. 2. **Firewall Restrictions**: Sometimes, firewall settings might block connections to certain ports. Ensure that your firewall settings allow traffic on the port your backend is listening on. 3. **Incorrect Hosts File Configuration**: It\'s unlikely, given your provided setup, but it\'s worth double-checking your `/etc/hosts` file. Ensure the configuration correctly points `somedomain.loc` to `127.0.0.1`. 4. **Port Misconfiguration**: If the application is intended to run on a port other than 80, you\'ll need to specify this port in your `destination` URL. For instance, if your backend server runs on port 3000, the `destination` should look like `\\"http://somedomain.loc:3000/api/:path*\\"`. 5. **Use HTTP Server for Backend**: If you are trying to proxy to a backend that is not actively set up as an HTTP server (e.g., if it\'s just a local developmental tool without an active server listening on port 80), this could result in the connection being refused. Ensure the backend service is correctly set up to receive HTTP requests on the specified port. 6. **Next.js Server Running Issues**: If you are running this Next.js application in development mode with `next dev`, ensure that the Next.js server is properly set up to handle rewrites and proxy requests without issues. Also, occasionally, restarting the Next.js development server can resolve unexpected behavior. 7. **Check Backend Server Logs**: If your backend server is running, check its logs for any errors or messages that could indicate why it\'s refusing connections. It might be the case that the server is running but encounters an issue when a connection is attempted. 8. **Test with Alternative Methods**: Use tools like `curl` directly from the server where your Next.js app runs to ensure the backend is accessible from that server with the domain name `somedomain.loc`. To diagnose, start by confirming that your backend server is accessible and listening on the expected port and that your system\'s firewall settings are not the cause of the issue.

Debugging Approach 1. `\'unique_prepared_users\'`에서 `\'EXISTS\'` 절 대신 `\'INNER JOIN\'` 또는 `\'LEFT JOIN\'`을 사용하여 실제로 매칭이 되는 경우만을 필터링해 내는 것입니다. 이 과정에서 `\'Order\'`와 `\'Log\'`의 일치 항목이 실제로 있는지 확인합니다. 2. 다음 단계로, 데이터가 예상대로 처리되고 있는지 확인하기 위해 중간 결과를 검증합니다. 예를 들어, `\'unique_prepared_users\'` 쿼리를 별도로 실행해보고, 기대하는 `\'uid\'` 항목이 실제로 결과에 포함되는지 확인합니다. 3. 데이터와 로직에 대한 이해도를 높이기 위해서는 `\'ORDER\'`와 `\'LOG\'` 테이블 모두에서 해당하는 날짜의 데이터를 조회하여 직접 비교해볼 필요가 있습니다. 만약 위의 접근 방식으로도 문제의 원인을 파악할 수 없다면, 문제가 되는 구체적인 데이터 예시와 함께 추가적인 조언을 구하기 위해 상황을 더 상세하게 설명해 주시면 도움이 될 것입니다. 데이터의 구조, 로직의 의도, 그리고 예상되는 결과의 구체적인 설명이 필요할 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"exclude token verification process on calling kpi 작문에서 문법 오류 고쳐줘","completion":"\\"Exclude the token verification process on calling KPI.\\""}]'),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],W={key:0},L={key:1};function q(n,e,l,p,o,s){const m=f("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(i(!0),a(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(i(),k(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
