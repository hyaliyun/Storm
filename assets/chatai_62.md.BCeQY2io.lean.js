This means that the sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) is relatively \\"tight\\" in terms of spacing. 3. Consider the pairs in ( A ) and ( B ). For ( (i, j) in A ), ( j - i ) is even, so ( j = i + 2m ) for some integer ( m geq 1 ). For ( (i, j) in B ), ( j - i ) is odd, so ( j = i + 2m + 1 ) for some integer ( m geq 0 ). 4.

For ( (i, j) in A ), since ( j - i ) is even, the differences ( a_j - a_i ) will generally be larger because the indices are further apart. Specifically, ( a_j - a_i ) will be the sum of an even number of differences ( a_{k+1} - a_k ), each of which is at most 1. 6. For ( (i, j) in B ), since ( j - i ) is odd, the differences ( a_j - a_i ) will generally be smaller because the indices are closer together. Specifically, ( a_j - a_i ) will be the sum of an odd number of differences ( a_{k+1} - a_k ), each of which is at most 1. 7.

This argument can be generalized for larger even ( n ) by noting that the product of differences for pairs in ( A ) will always involve larger differences (since they are sums of even numbers of terms each at most 1), while the product of differences for pairs in ( B ) will involve smaller differences (since they are sums of odd numbers of terms each at most 1).

Now, we can find the ratio of the price of the brie to the price of the salami: Price of brie : Price of salami = 12.00 : 4.00 To simplify the ratio, we divide both sides by the price of the salami (4.00): (12.00 / 4.00) : (4.00 / 4.00) = 3 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of the price of the brie to the price of the salami is boxed{3:1} ."},{"prompt":"the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_2=3, a_4=6, find the common ratio q=_______.","completion":"Given that in the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_2=3, a_4=6, The common ratio q satisfies q^{2}= frac {a_4}{a_2}= frac {6}{3}=2, Solving for q we get q=± sqrt {2}.

First, we need to find the domain of the given function. The domain is the set of all possible values that can be inputted into the function without making it undefined. 2.

The formula for the diagonal d of a rectangular box with lengths l, w, and h is [d = sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}.] Given that the lengths are 2a, a, and a, we substitute these into the formula to find the diameter of the sphere: [d = sqrt{(2a)^2 + a^2 + a^2} = sqrt{4a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = sqrt{6a^2}.] Since the diameter d is equal to 2R, where R is the radius of the sphere, we have [2R = sqrt{6a^2}.] Solving for R gives us [R = frac{sqrt{6a^2}}{2} = sqrt{frac{6a^2}{4}} = sqrt{frac{3}{2}a^2}.] The surface area S_{text{sphere}} of a sphere with radius R is given by the formula [S_{text{sphere}} = 4pi R^2.] Substituting R = sqrt{frac{3}{2}a^2} into this formula gives us [S_{text{sphere}} = 4pi left(sqrt{frac{3}{2}a^2}right)^2 = 4pi cdot frac{3}{2}a^2 = 6pi a^2.] Therefore, the surface area of the sphere is 6pi a^2.

The centers of the circles are at these vertices, and the radius of each circle is such that the sum of the areas of the circles equals the area of the square. Let ( P, Q, R, S ) be arbitrary points inside the circles centered at ( A, B, C, D ) respectively. 2. **Area of the Square and Circles:** Assume the side length of the square is ( s ). The area of the square is ( s^2 ). The area of each circle is ( pi r^2 ). Given that the sum of the areas of the four circles equals the area of the square: [ 4 pi r^2 = s^2 implies r^2 = frac{s^2}{4pi} implies r = frac{s}{2sqrt{pi}} ] 3. **Position of Points:** Since ( P, Q, R, S ) are arbitrary points inside their respective circles, they are within a distance ( r ) from ( A, B, C, D ) respectively. 4. **Convex Quadrilateral Condition:** To show that ( P, Q, R, S ) form a convex quadrilateral, we need to show that no three points are collinear.

For the sum of the areas of the circles to be minimal, the line ( ell ) should intersect the segments ( BA ) and ( BC ). Let ( T_A ) and ( T_C ) be the points of intersection, and let ( a = BT_A ) and ( c = BT_C ). 6. **Minimizing the Sum of Areas:** We need to minimize: [ left(frac{AT_A}{T_AB}right)^2 + left(frac{CT_C}{T_CB}right)^2 = left(frac{1}{a} - 1right)^2 + left(frac{1}{c} - 1right)^2 ] This happens when ( a = c ), i.e., when ( ell ) makes angles of ( 45^circ ) with ( CA ) and ( CB ). 7. **Conclusion:** Since the minimal sum of the areas of the circles is achieved when the line ( ell ) intersects the segments ( BA ) and ( BC ) at equal distances, it implies that the points ( P, Q, R, S ) cannot be collinear.

To find the length of (CD): 1. **Identify the Properties of Tangent and Radius:** Since (AB) is tangent to the circle at point (A): - The tangent at point (A) is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at point (A). - Let the center of the circle be (O). - Thus, (OA) is perpendicular to (AB). 2. **Determine Radius (r):** Since (BC) is the diameter of the circle (as it passes through the center (O)): - (BC = 2r). - Given (BC = 12), we can find: [ 2r = 12 implies r = frac{12}{2} = 6 ] 3. **Perpendicular Distances and Parallel Chords:** Since (CD) is parallel to (AB) and both are perpendicular to the radius: - They are equidistant from the center along the perpendicular distance. - Let (M) be the midpoint of (CD). Then (OM) is perpendicular to (CD), and similarly (OA) is perpendicular to (AB). 4. **Relationship Between Chords and Radii:** For chord (CD) parallel to tangent (AB): - Using the property of circles, if a chord is parallel to a tangent to a circle, the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord equals the radius minus the perpendicular distance from the center to the tangent. - The perpendicular distance from the center (O) to (AB) is the radius (6 units). - Let (d) be the perpendicular distance from the center (O) to (CD).

The area of (triangle ABC) can be expressed as: [ S_{ABC} = frac{1}{2} a d_a = frac{1}{2} b d_b = frac{1}{2} c d_c ] where (S_{ABC}) is the area of (triangle ABC), (a, b, c) are the lengths of the sides (BC, CA, AB) respectively. 2. **Summing the Areas**: Consider the area relation, combining all parts: [ 2 S_{ABC} = a d_a + b d_b + c d_c ] 3. **Maximizing the Product**: To find (O) such that (d_a d_b d_c) is maximized, we note from the product of the distances and the algebraic inequality such as the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality.

This is a well-known result in triangle geometry, indicating that when the product (a d_a cdot b d_b cdot c d_c) is maximized, the point (O) must be such that the individual products (a d_a, b d_b, c d_c) are all equal. 5. **Geometric Interpretation**: The condition (a d_a = b d_b = c d_c) means that the triangles (BOC), (AOC) and (AOB) formed by connecting (O) to (A), (B), and (C) must have the same area. The only point within (triangle ABC) that satisfies this condition is the centroid, where the medians of the triangle intersect. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the maximum product (d_a d_b d_c) is achieved when (O) is the centroid of triangle (ABC).

In an isosceles triangle, there are two equal sides. Hence, the base case is trivial. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for any convex polygon with fewer than k sides. We need to prove that a convex k-gon, P, divided into isosceles triangles by non-intersecting diagonals, also has at least two equal sides. 3. **Consider a diagonal** d of P that divides P into two convex polygons P_1 and P_2. Note that both P_1 and P_2 have fewer than k sides. 4. By our induction hypothesis, in each of the polygons P_1 and P_2, there exist two equal sides: * Suppose in P_1, the equal sides are a_1 and b_1. * Suppose in P_2, the equal sides are a_2 and b_2. 5. **Case Analysis**: - If neither a_1 nor b_1 coincides with d, then a_1 and b_1 are sides of the original polygon P. Thus, P has two equal sides, and the induction step is complete. - Similarly, if neither a_2 nor b_2 coincides with d, then P also has two equal sides a_2 and b_2, and the induction step is complete. 6. Without loss of generality, suppose that b_1 = d. Then, in P_2, if a_2 or b_2 does not coincide with d: - If a_2 neq d and b_2 neq d, then a_2 and b_2 are equal sides in P, and the proof is complete. - Otherwise, suppose b_2 = d. This means that d is the equal side shared between P_1 and P_2. 7. Finally, considering a_1 and a_2, which are the remaining equal sides in P_1 and P_2, respectively: - Since d = b_1 = b_2 and both P_1 and P_2 were divided such that one side of the isosceles triangles in each coincides as equal sides with d, a_1 and a_2 must be equal. - Hence, a_1 and a_2 are two distinct sides of P which are equal. By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all convex polygons that are divided into isosceles triangles by non-intersecting diagonals. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"the book Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, there is a problem recorded as follows: Today, a group of people collectively buy an item.

Xiao Ming approaches this problem using a system of linear equations. Let's break down the solution step by step, adhering to the information provided and the rules for rewriting: 1. **First Scenario Analysis**: - The problem states that if each person contributes 8 coins, there will be 3 coins left over. This scenario is represented by the equation 8x - 3 = y. - Here, x represents the number of people, and y represents the price of the item. 2. **Second Scenario Analysis**: - The problem also mentions that if each person contributes 7 coins, there will be 4 coins short of the total price. To represent this scenario, we need an equation that reflects being 4 coins short when each of the x people contributes 7 coins. - To adjust for the shortfall, we add 4 to the total contributions made by the people to equal the price of the item. Thus, the equation that represents this scenario is 7x + 4 = y. 3. **Conclusion**: - Comparing the given options for the second equation that fits the problem's description, we identify that option B: 7x + 4 = y correctly represents the second scenario where each person contributes 7 coins, and there is a shortfall of 4 coins.

The problem can be visualized as coloring the vertices of this graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color (proper vertex coloring). 3. **Determining the minimum number of letters:** This problem is equivalent to finding the chromatic number of the graph representing the grid. In graph theory, the chromatic number of a chessboard-like lattice (grid graph) is 2, because we can color it in a checkerboard pattern. 4. **Checkerboard pattern explanation:** - Label one set of alternating nodes (like black squares on a chessboard) with letter \`A\`. - Label the other set of alternating nodes (like white squares on a chessboard) with letter \`B\`. This ensures that any two adjacent nodes are labeled differently. If we connect any two nodes of the same label, there must be at least one node labeled with the other letter between them, satisfying the requirement of the problem. 5. **Conclusion:** The smallest number of different letters required to label the nodes such that the condition is met is 2.

(We suppose that there is no place in a decimal representations such that all digits starting from that place are 9's.) *Proposed by A. Golovanov*","completion":"To determine if it is possible to color all positive real numbers using 10 colors such that any two numbers differing in exactly one decimal place have different colors, we can use the following approach: 1. **Define an Equivalence Relation:** Define an equivalence relation equiv on the set of positive real numbers mathbb{R}^+ by stating that a equiv b if and only if a - b has only finitely many non-zero digits in its decimal representation. This relation is: - Reflexive: a - a = 0, which has no non-zero digits. - Symmetric: If a - b has finitely many non-zero digits, then b - a = -(a - b) also has finitely many non-zero digits. - Transitive: If a - b and b - c both have finitely many non-zero digits, then (a - b) + (b - c) = a - c also has finitely many non-zero digits. 2. **Partition into Equivalence Classes:** The equivalence relation equiv partitions mathbb{R}^+ into disjoint equivalence classes. Let f(a) denote the equivalence class containing a. 3. **Choice Function:** By the Axiom of Choice, there exists a choice function g that selects a representative from each equivalence class. Specifically, for each equivalence class f(a), g(f(a)) is a representative element of that class. 4. **Define the Coloring Function:** Define a coloring function c: mathbb{R}^+ rightarrow mathbb{Z}_{10} by setting c(r) to be the sum of the decimal digits of r - g(f(r)) modulo 10. Since r equiv g(f(r)), the difference r - g(f(r)) has only finitely many non-zero digits, making the sum of its decimal digits well-defined. 5. **Verify the Coloring Property:** If two numbers a and b differ in exactly one decimal place, then their difference a - b has exactly one non-zero digit. Consequently, the sum of the decimal digits of a - b is a single non-zero digit, which implies that c(a) neq c(b). Thus, the coloring function c ensures that any two numbers differing in exactly one decimal place are assigned different colors.

Let's proceed step-by-step. Step 1: Check for trivial solutions Firstly, consider the simplest cases where n = 1. - For any prime p, (1, p) is a solution: - -p is a prime. - -1 < 2p. - -(p-1)^1 + 1 = -p + 1 is divisible by 1^{p-1} (trivially true). So (1, p) are solutions for any prime p. Step 2: Consider the case p = 2 If p = 2, we consider n > 1. The problem simplifies to testing: -2 leq 2p = 4 implies -2 leq 4 text{, which is always true}. Plug p = 2 into the divisibility condition: -(2-1)^n + 1 text{ must be divisible by } n^{2-1} = n -(1)^n + 1 text{ must be divisible by } n implies -1 + 1 = 0text{ is divisible by } n. So, the condition holds for n = 2 and only n = 2 works since -1 + 1 = 0 and n = 2: Thus, (2, 2) is another solution. Step 3: Assume p geq 3 For p geqslant 3, n must be odd since it's easier to work with prime numbers. Select a prime q that divides n such that q | n and examine the conditions given: - By Fermat's Little Theorem, (p - 1)^q equiv -1 pmod{q}. General condition derived: (p-1)^{an} equiv (-1)^a pmod{q}. Using the above equivalence, we seek integers a and b such that an + b(q-1) = 1. Use Bezout's identity where a and b come from the equation gcd(n, q-1) = 1. For q to apply, assume it is the smallest prime divisor of n: - Thus a must be odd, which implies (p-1) equiv -1 pmod{q} and q | p. - By minimality of q, p = q and n = p is needed. Step 4: Conclude the solution Given p = q, substitute to check structure: (p - 1)^p + 1 = sum_{k=0}^p binom{p}{k} (-1)^k p^{p-k}. We analyze this sum: - (p^2) is a major term. - Sum of lesser terms given by A is A mod p^3 (and p^3 divides sum beyond p^2). This implies that p must be 3 (since p = 3 satisfies the criteria where (p - 1)^p + 1 = 2^3 +1 = 9 meets the needed divisibility by p). Finally using divisibility: (3-1)^3 + 1 = 2^3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 n^{p-1} = 3^{3-1} = 9 Finally, this verifies: n=p=3 implies (3,3) # Conclusion: The solutions are (1, p) for any prime p and (2, 2)., and (3, 3) as additional pairs. boxed{(1, p) text{ for any prime p}, (2, 2), (3, 3)}"},{"prompt":"a market, a dozen eggs cost as much as a pound of rice, and a halfliter of kerosene costs as much as 4 eggs.

Let's assume that such a path (a non-self-intersecting path through all squares on the surface of a Rubik's cube using the diagonals of each square) exists. 2. The surface of a Rubik's cube consists of 54 squares (as each face of the cube has 9 squares and there are 6 faces: (6 times 9 = 54)). 3. Each square has a corresponding diagonal, so the hypothetical path contains 54 diagonals. 4. Notice that there are 56 vertices (or \\"nodes\\") on the surface of the cube. This is because each face of the Rubik's cube is a 3x3 grid, contributing ( (3 + 1) times (3 + 1) = 16 ) unique vertices per face. However, (4) vertices belong to more than one face (shared at the edges), which leads to the overcount. Thus, the actual count of unique vertices is indeed 56 (rather than (54)). 5. According to the problem's constraints, this hypothetical path must traverse through each of these nodes. 6. However, since the number of nodes (56) exceeds the number of diagonals (54), it implies that there must be at least one node that this path does not pass through. 7.

This set M is effectively the strip between two parallel lines through points A_i and A_j perpendicular to the segment A_i A_j. 2. **Convex Hull Argument:** Consider the convex hull V of these n points, which is the smallest convex polygon containing all these points. Every point must lie on the boundary of V, as any point inside the hull would violate the given conditions. Thus, V is a convex polygon with vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n. 3. **Sum of Angles:** For a convex n-gon, the sum of its interior angles is: [ 180^circ (n-2) ] If every interior angle of this polygon is at most 90^circ, we have: [ 180^circ (n-2) leq 90^circ n ] 4. **Inequality Solving:** [ 180^circ n - 360^circ leq 90^circ n ] [ 90^circ n leq 360^circ ] [ n leq 4 ] Therefore, the maximum number of points that can be placed in a plane is 4. # Part (b) - Space 1. **Convex Polyhedron:** Similar to the plane case, in space, the points must form the vertices of a convex polyhedron. 2. **Dimensional Shift:** Considering the convex hull V of n points in 3D space.

No matter how ( triangle ADE ) rotates, the segments ( BD ) and ( CE ) will never be zero, and the points ( B, C ) and ( D, E ) do not lie on the same line. This is due to the fact that the triangles are continuously different in shape and position. 4. Draw a line passing through ( A, C, E ) and the midpoint ( M ) of ( CE ).

Prove that some two of the pairwise distances between the rooks are equal. (The distance between two rooks is the distance between the centers of their cell.)","completion":"1. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose that all pairwise distances between the eight rooks are distinct. There are (binom{8}{2} = 28) pairs of rooks, so there must be 28 distinct distances. 2. **Form of distances**: The distance between two rooks on a chessboard is given by the Euclidean distance formula: [ d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ] where (x) and (y) are the differences in the row and column indices of the two rooks, respectively. Since no two rooks attack each other, (x) and (y) are non-zero integers between 1 and 7 (inclusive). 3. **Symmetry in distances**: Note that the distance (sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) is the same as (sqrt{y^2 + x^2}). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that (x leq y). 4. **Counting possible distances**: We need to count the number of distinct pairs ((x, y)) where (1 leq x leq y leq 7). This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to pick two objects (not necessarily distinct) from a set of 7 elements. The number of such pairs is given by: [ sum_{x=1}^{7} (8-x) = 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28 ] So, there are 28 possible pairs ((x, y)). 5. **Contradiction by example**: However, not all pairs ((x, y)) yield distinct distances. For example: [ 7^2 + 1^2 = 49 + 1 = 50 quad text{and} quad 5^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 25 = 50 ] Thus, the pairs ((7, 1)) and ((5, 5)) both represent the same distance (sqrt{50}). 6. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle**: Since there are only 27 distinct values for distances (as shown by the example above), but we have 28 pairs of rooks, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two pairs of rooks must have the same distance. 7. **Conclusion**: This contradicts our initial assumption that all pairwise distances are distinct. Therefore, some two of the pairwise distances between the rooks must be equal. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Simplify sqrt{1sin^2 160^circ}.

Each set of four vertices determines a unique intersection: [ text{Number of intersections} = binom{n}{4} = frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} ] 4. **Total Regions Calculation**: Each diagonal can potentially add a new region, and each intersection of two diagonals adds yet another region. Thus, the total number of regions is given by: [ text{Total number of regions} = 1 + left( binom{n}{2} - n right) + binom{n}{4} ] Expanding using the binomial coefficients: [ text{Total number of regions} = 1 + left( frac{n(n-1)}{2} - n right) + frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} ] 5. **Conclusion**: The formula for the number of regions formed inside an (n)-sided convex polygon is: [ boxed{1 + binom{n}{2} - n + binom{n}{4}} ] This concludes the detailed solution."},{"prompt":"A geometric shape with a triangular crosssection is _____. (Write down one type)","completion":"To find a geometric shape with a triangular cross-section, we consider various shapes and their properties: 1. A cube can be cut in such a way that it has a triangular cross-section. This is achieved by slicing the cube diagonally. 2. A cone, when cut along its axis, can also form a geometric shape with a triangular cross-section. This is due to the conical shape tapering to a point. 3. A triangular prism inherently has a triangular cross-section, as it extends the shape of a triangle along a straight line. Considering these options, we conclude that multiple geometric shapes can have a triangular cross-section. Among the examples provided, a cube is one such shape that can have a triangular cross-section when cut appropriately.

The probability that Jarry is not chosen as the president is 9/10 (since there are 10 members and he is just one of them). After the president is chosen, there are 9 members left. The probability that Jarry is not chosen as the secretary is then 8/9 (since he is one of the 9 remaining members). After the secretary is chosen, there are 8 members left, and the probability that Jarry is chosen as the treasurer is 1/8.

The circle tangent to side AB of triangle ABC passes through E, and the circle tangent to side AC passes through D. Calculate the angles of triangle ABC.","completion":"1. Consider the parallelograms (ABCD) and (ACBE). In these parallelograms, (AD parallel BC parallel AE), considering the direction as well. Consequently, the points (D) and (E) are mirror images of each other with respect to (A). 2. The angles (BAC) (which are less than (180^{circ})) encompass two adjacent external angles, constructed along the rays (AB) and (AC), respectively. These related regions are opposite each other at their intersection which is the vertex (A). Therefore, the incircles of (triangle ABC) meeting at (D) and (E) are similar by a similarity transformation about (A). 3. Because of the mentioned similarities, the rays (AD) and (AE), which are extensions, are also related through this similarity. 4. The ray (AD) intersects the excenter circle passing through (D) a second time between (A) and (D). Otherwise, in the opposing scenario, (D) would be the only intersection point of the circle and the parallelogram (ABCD), excluding a tangent inside segment (AC). Similarly, (E) intersects an excenter circle relative to (AB) and ray (AE), at a point further from (A). 5. Thus, points (D) and (E) are similarly transformed under the mentioned centrally symmetric transformation. Given that (DA = EA), the similarity ratio is (1), indicating both circles have equal radii. 6. Therefore, the line connecting the centers of the circles, (OO'), is parallel to (BC) but also passes through (A). As established by the external angles at (A), both (D) and (E) lie on this bisector line. Thus, alternate external angles yield (angle ABC = angle ACB), establishing (triangle ABC) is isosceles, where (AB = AC). 7. To find the ratio of the base (BC) and the sides (AB) or (AC), let (F) be the midpoint of (BC), and let (G) be the point of tangency on the extension of (BC) with the excircle touching (AC). 8. It is known that (BG) equals half the perimeter of (triangle ABC). Using standard notations for sides and angles: [ a = BC = AD = AO + OD = FG + OG = (BG - BF) + AF ] Simplifying, we get: [ (BG - BF) + AF = frac{a + 2b}{2} - frac{a}{2} + sqrt{b^2 - frac{a^2}{4}} ] Solving for unknowns, we have: [ (a - b)^2 = b^2 - frac{a^2}{4}, quad (a neq 0) ] Considering cosine rules: [ frac{a / 2}{b} = cos beta = frac{4}{5}, quad beta = gamma = 36^circ 52' quad alpha = 106^circ 16' ] 9.

Also, the total volume (V) can be expressed considering point (M) dividing the tetrahedron into four smaller tetrahedrons: [ V = V_{MBCD} + V_{MACD} + V_{MABD} + V_{MABC}. ] 4. Thus, rewriting the volume, we get: [ 3V = S_A d_A + S_B d_B + S_C d_C + S_D d_D, ] where (d_A, d_B, d_C, d_D) are the perpendicular distances from (M) to the faces (BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC) respectively. 5.

Here, the sum of red edge products (where ( i ) and ( j ) have different parity) can be expressed as: [ k = sum_{substack{i < j i+j text{ even}}} x_i x_j ] Similarly, the sum of blue edge products (where ( i ) and ( j ) have the same parity) is: [ s = sum_{substack{i < j i+j text{ odd}}} x_i x_j ] 4. Consider the expression: [ left( x_1 - x_2 + x_3 - x_4 + ldots + x_{99} - x_{100} right)^2 ] This can be expanded and simplified as follows: [ left( x_1 - x_2 + x_3 - x_4 + ldots + x_{99} - x_{100} right)^2 = sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i^2 - 2k + 2s ] 5.

To find if equality can be achieved, consider: If ( x_1 = x_2 = ldots = x_{100} = frac{1}{10} ), then: [ left( frac{1}{10} - frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{10} - frac{1}{10} + ldots + frac{1}{10} - frac{1}{10} right)^2 = 0 ] This simplifies correctly as each pair cancels out: [ 1 - 2k + 2s = 0 implies 1 = 2k - 2s implies k - s = frac{1}{2} ] # Conclusion: The maximum value of ( k - s ) is ( frac{1}{2} ), which can be achieved.

Consider the triangles triangle BNL and triangle CLM. - Since the incircle touches BC at L, CA at M, and AB at N, these touch points divide the sides of triangle ABC into segments of equal length from the vertex to the touch point to the other vertex.

The angles at the bases of these isosceles triangles can be expressed as follows: - angle BNL = angle BNL = frac{1}{2} left(180^circ - angle B right) because the sum of the angles in triangle BNL is 180^circ. - angle CLM = angle CLM = frac{1}{2} left(180^circ - angle C right) because the sum of the angles in triangle CLM is 180^circ. 4. Evaluate angle NLM: - Since angle NLM is exterior to triangle CLM, we have: [ angle NLM = angle BLN = frac{1}{2} left(180^circ - angle A right) ] - Similarly, angle NLM < 90^circ since frac{1}{2} left(180^circ - angle A right) is always less than 90^circ for any angle A in triangle ABC (since angle A < 180^circ). 5.

The weighted probabilities of using each die, given three sixes, are calculated as follows: - Probability of using the fair die: [ P(F|SSS) = frac{frac{1}{216}}{frac{1}{216} + frac{8}{27} + frac{1}{27}} = frac{1}{379}. ] - Probability of using the second biased die: [ P(B_2|SSS) = frac{frac{8}{27}}{frac{1}{216} + frac{8}{27} + frac{1}{27}} = frac{288}{379}. ] - Probability of using the third biased die: [ P(B_3|SSS) = frac{frac{1}{27}}{frac{1}{216} + frac{8}{27} + frac{1}{27}} = frac{90}{379}. ] 5. The probability of rolling a fourth six is then [ frac{1}{379} times frac{1}{6} + frac{288}{379} times frac{2}{3} + frac{90}{379} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{2274} + frac{576}{1137} + frac{90}{1137} = frac{666}{1137}. ] Thus, since 666 and 1137 are relatively prime, our answer is boxed{1803}."},{"prompt":"Using a sector with a radius of 6cm and a central angle of 120° to form the lateral surface of a cone, the radius of the base of this cone is ( ) A: 2cm B: 3cm C: 4cm D: 6cm","completion":"Let the radius of the base of the cone be r.

Hence, assume that not all the lines intersect at the same point. 2. **Definition of Distance**: Given this assumption, there exist intersection points that are at a strictly positive distance from some line. Consider the smallest such distance between an intersection point and a line. Let this smallest distance be denoted as d, the line be denoted by d, and the intersection point be denoted by A. 3. **Existence of Intersection Points**: By the problem's hypothesis, at least three lines pass through any intersection point. Thus, at the point A, there are at least three lines intersecting, but none of them are parallel to the line d. 4. **Intersection with Line (d)**: These three lines passing through A intersect line d at three points, which we can label as B, C, and D. For clarity, denote the orthogonal projection of the point A onto the line d as P. 5. **Point Location**: Without loss of generality, assume that points B and C lie on the same side of P (since there are three points, at least two must be on the same side of P). 6. **Perpendicular Distance**: Consider the distance from point C to the line passing through points A and B. By geometric properties, this distance will be strictly less than the original distance from A to d. This is because, when projecting on d, the perpendicular distances between lines would generate a point closer to d. 7. **Contradiction of Minimality**: This new smaller distance contradicts our assumption of the minimality of the distance between the point A and the line d. Given that we supposed this was the smallest positive distance, this contradiction forces us to reconsider our assumption. 8. **Conclusion**: Since the assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be that our assumption that not all lines intersect at a single point was false.

The centers of the three faces that meet at a corner form a triangle. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we find the lengths of the sides of this triangle as follows: - One side is the diagonal of the face that is 12 times 16, which is 10 inches (since 12^2 + 16^2 = 144 + 256 = 400, and sqrt{400} = 20, but since we're dealing with the midpoint, it's half, so 10 inches). - The second side is the diagonal of the face that is 12 times x, which simplifies to sqrt{left(frac{x}{2}right)^2 + 36}. - The third side is the diagonal of the face that is 16 times x, which simplifies to sqrt{left(frac{x}{2}right)^2 + 64}. 2. **Use the area to find an altitude:** Given that the area of the triangle is 30 square inches and one of the sides (the base) is 10 inches, we can find the altitude corresponding to this base. The area of a triangle is frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. Therefore, we have: [30 = frac{1}{2} times 10 times text{height}] Solving for the height gives us: [60 = 10 times text{height}] [text{height} = 6] 3. **Relate the altitude to the box's dimensions:** The altitude of 6 inches divides the base of 10 inches into two segments.

Similarly, g'(x) represents the slope of the tangent to g(x). For the given functions, - f'(x) = e^{x-2}, - g'(x) = e^{x+2022}. 2. **Equations of tangent lines:** If a line is tangent to f(x) at a point P_1(x_1, y_1), the slope of this line must be equal to f'(x_1). Since y_1 = f(x_1) = e^{x_1-2}, the equation of the tangent line can be expressed using the point-slope form as: - y - e^{x_1-2} = e^{x_1-2}(x - x_1).

Step 1: Determine the value of omega based on the minimum positive period of the function f(x). The given minimum positive period T of f(x) = cos(omega x + phi) is pi. Since we know that the period of cos(omega x + phi) is frac{2pi}{omega}, we can set this equal to pi to solve for omega: frac{2pi}{omega} = pi implies omega = 2. Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the function about the line x = -frac{pi}{12}. The condition for symmetry about this line implies that cos(2(-frac{pi}{12}) + phi) = pm1. This leads to simplification: cos(-frac{pi}{6} + phi) = pm1. Since cos(theta) = pm1 when theta = kpi, where k is any integer, we can deduce that -frac{pi}{6} + phi = kpi + frac{pi}{6}, leading to: phi = kpi + frac{pi}{3}. Step 3: Considering the given condition |phi| < frac{pi}{2}, we find the value of phi. The only value of phi that fits this condition and the derived equation from step 2 is when k = 0, so: phi = frac{pi}{3}. However, the initial mistake in the symmetry analysis needs correction. We should have phi = frac{pi}{6} for the correct symmetry and bound conditions. Step 4: Rewrite the function with determined omega and phi. Therefore, the function is: f(x) = cos(2x + frac{pi}{6}).

We use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s. Relative speed in m/s = 77.99376049916006 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 77.99376049916006 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 21665.48902782224 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s ≈ 21.66548902782224 m/s Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the man is equal to the length of the train, which is 130 meters.

Let's first express S solely in terms of x by substituting y: S = x(180 - frac{3}{x} + frac{400}{x^2}) = 180x - 3 + frac{400}{x} We'll find the derivative of S with respect to x to find the critical points: S'(x) = frac{d}{dx} (180x - 3 + frac{400}{x}) = 180 - 0 + frac{-400}{x^2} S'(x) = 180 - frac{400}{x^2} Setting the derivative S'(x) to 0 to find the maximum value, we get: 180 - frac{400}{x^2} = 0 implies frac{400}{x^2} = 180 implies x^2 = frac{400}{180} implies x^2 = frac{20}{9} implies x = pmfrac{2sqrt{5}}{3} However, since x must be positive, we ignore the negative solution, yielding: x = frac{2sqrt{5}}{3} When looking at the second derivative to ensure this is a maximum, we'll see that: S''(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(-frac{400}{x^2}right) = frac{800}{x^3} As x is positive, this second derivative is positive as well, confirming a minimum, which seems contradictory to the initial problem statement that seeks to maximize S.

The equation for the area is: [A = -x^2 + 20x] We can rewrite this equation by adding and subtracting the square of half the coefficient of x, which is (20/2)^2 = 100, to complete the square: [A = -x^2 + 20x - 100 + 100] [A = -(x^2 - 20x + 100) + 100] [A = 100 - (x - 10)^2] This equation shows that the area A is maximized when (x - 10)^2 = 0, which occurs when x = 10. Therefore, the maximum area is: [A = 100 - (10 - 10)^2 = 100] Thus, the greatest possible area of the rectangular pen that can be enclosed with 40 feet of fencing is boxed{100} square feet, and this maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square with sides of 10 feet."},{"prompt":"Find the number of ordered pairs of integers (a, b) with 1 leq a leq 50 and b geq 0, such that the polynomial x^2 + ax + b can be factored into the product of two linear factors with integer coefficients.","completion":"For the polynomial x^2 + ax + b to be factored into two linear factors (x-r)(x-s) with integer coefficients, we need r and s to be integers satisfying: [r+s = -a] [rs = b] Given 1 leq a leq 50, and b geq 0, the roots r and s should satisfy r+s = -a and rs = b.

To solve it, we simplify the given complex number z, find its conjugate bar{z}, and then determine the coordinates of the corresponding point in the complex plane. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. Simplify the given complex number z. We have z= frac{i^{3}}{i-1}. Recall that i^{2} = -1, so i^{3} = i^{2} cdot i = -1 cdot i = -i. Now, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to rationalize the denominator: z= frac{-i}{i-1} cdot frac{-i-1}{-i-1} = frac{-i cdot (-i-1)}{(i-1)(-i-1)} = frac{-i(-i) - i(-1)}{(-1)(-1) - i(-1)} = frac{-1 + i}{2} 2. Find the conjugate bar{z} of z. The conjugate of z = a + bi is given by bar{z} = a - bi. Thus, the conjugate of z = -frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2}i is bar{z} = -frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}i. 3. Determine the quadrant that corresponds to bar{z} in the complex plane. The coordinates of the point corresponding to bar{z} are (-frac{1}{2}, -frac{1}{2}).

We are required to color the edges of this prism using three colors such that at every vertex, all three colors meet, and each face (including the bases) has edges of all three colors. 2. **Scenario with n Divisible by 3:** Suppose n is divisible by 3. For simplicity, let us denote the colors as Color 1, Color 2, and Color 3. In one of the bases (let's call it the lower base), arrange the edges in a cyclic order (counterclockwise) such that every sequence of three consecutive edges comprises all three colors exactly once. This arrangement can be repeated around the entire perimeter of the base, ensuring that the coloring is periodic with a period of 3. 3. **Checking Validity:** By examining the vertices, if we notice that following this scheme results in a consistent periodic pattern, we see that: [ Color(Edge_{i+1}) = Color(Edge_i) + 1 (text{mod} 3) ] where (Edge_i) is any edge in the lower base. Here’s how the lower base looks: [ begin{aligned} Edge_1 & = text{Color 1} Edge_2 & = text{Color 2} Edge_3 & = text{Color 3} Edge_4 & = text{Color 1} & text{and so on} end{aligned} ] If we apply the same concept to the upper base but make sure each vertical edge connecting corresponding vertices in the two bases is likewise colored to complete the array. 4. **Ensuring the Coloring Conditions:** To confirm that these colors meet at every vertex, we observe: - Each triangular side face will inherit the coloring pattern (Color 1, Color 2, Color 3 around its edges). - Vertices are shared between two adjacent faces, hence guaranteeing three unique colors due to the periodicity and cyclic placement. - As the vertices of each base satisfy rotational symmetry by period 3, the lateral faces (rectangular or trapezoidal depending on the rotating base) naturally comply. 5. **Conclusion:** This thorough repetition ensures adherence to the required conditions for both each face and vertex. Therefore, the polygonal bases and prism structure permit a three-colored consistent scheme, only if n is a multiple of 3. Hence, the prisms can be appropriately colored if ( n ) is a multiple of 3: [ boxed{3k, k in mathbb{Z}} ]"},{"prompt":"A certain percentage of the 880 students at a college are enrolled in biology classes, and 638 students are not enrolled in a biology class.

A balanced path is defined such that the sum of the x-coordinates of its (2n+1) vertices equals the sum of their y-coordinates. 2. **Level Lines:** Consider the level lines (x + y = k) for (k in {0, 1, ldots, 2n}). These lines pass through each unit square in the (n times n) grid exactly once. Each level line intersects the balanced path at exactly one lattice point. 3. **Balanced Path Property:** For a balanced path, the sum of the x-coordinates equals the sum of the y-coordinates. This implies that for each point ((x_i, y_i)) on the path, the level line (x + y = x_i + y_i) intersects the path at ((x_i, y_i)). 4. **Area Calculation:** To find the area divided by the path, consider the contribution of each segment of the path to the area below it. For a point ((x_i, y_i)) on the path: - If (y_i ge x_i), the level line (x + y = x_i + y_i) passes through (frac{y_i - x_i}{2}) unit lattice squares between ((x_i, y_i)) and (left(frac{x_i + y_i}{2}, frac{x_i + y_i}{2}right)). - Similarly, if (x_i > y_i), the level line passes through (frac{x_i - y_i}{2}) unit lattice squares. 5. **Summing the Contributions:** The total area of the bottom half of the square can be found by summing the contributions of each segment of the path. The formula for the area of the bottom half is: [ text{Area}_{text{bottom}} = frac{n^2}{2} + sum_{i=0}^{2n} frac{y_i - x_i}{2} ] Since the path is balanced, the sum of the x-coordinates equals the sum of the y-coordinates, implying: [ sum_{i=0}^{2n} x_i = sum_{i=0}^{2n} y_i ] Therefore, the sum (sum_{i=0}^{2n} (y_i - x_i) = 0). 6. **Conclusion:** Substituting this into the area formula, we get: [ text{Area}_{text{bottom}} = frac{n^2}{2} + frac{0}{2} = frac{n^2}{2} ] Thus, the area of the bottom half is (frac{n^2}{2}), which is half of the total area of the square (n^2). Therefore, the balanced path divides the square into two equal areas. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"A river boat travels at a constant speed from point A to point B.

To find a four-sided polygon (X_1X_2X_3X_4) of the smallest possible perimeter that can be inscribed within a given quadrilateral (ABCD), 2. we start by noting that the problem may not have a solution in the strict sense, i.e., there may not be a true quadrilateral where all four vertices are distinct. This needs to be proven. 3. Reflect quadrilateral (ABCD) with respect to side (AB). Let the image be labeled as (AB'C'D'). 4. Reflect the resulting quadrilateral (AB'C'D') with respect to side (B'C). Let the image be labeled as (A'BC''D''). 5. Reflect the quadrilateral (A'BC''D'') with respect to side (C''D''). The final position will be (A''B'C''D''). 6. Now, consider an arbitrary inscribed quadrilateral (PXQYZR), where (P) is a point on side (AD) and the quadrilateral passes through (P). 7. The perimeter of the inscribed quadrilateral (PXQYZR) is equal (evident on a path) to the length of the broken line (PXQY'ZR''P'''). 8.

Cases: 1. **Case 1: If (AD) and (A''D'') are not parallel and similarly oriented**, the required point (P) will be the base of the perpendicular dropped from the center of rotation that maps segment (AD) to segment (A''D''). 2. **Case 2: If (AD) and (A''D'') are parallel and similarly oriented**, the minimal configuration is achieved when the inscribed quadrilateral so formed results in a family of solutions with the same perimeter. Here, the inscribed quadrilaterals will have the same perimeter due to the parallel corresponding sides and cannot be identified to one distinct configuration. 11.

Consider a real-coefficient polynomial ( P(x) ) that takes only non-negative values for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).

First, let's address the trivial case where ( P(x) equiv 0 ). In this case, we can simply take ( n = 1 ) and ( Q_1(x) equiv 0 ). 3. Assume that ( P(x) ) is a non-zero polynomial. For the polynomial ( P(x) ) to take only non-negative values, its non-real roots must come in conjugate pairs, and each real root must have even multiplicity. 4. Consider a polynomial ( P(x) ) which has only real roots and each root has even multiplicity. We can factorize ( P(x) ) as: [ P(x) = a (x - alpha_1)^{l_1} (x - alpha_2)^{l_2} cdots (x - alpha_k)^{l_k} R(x), ] where ( a > 0 ), ( alpha_1, alpha_2, cdots, alpha_k in mathbb{R} ), and ( l_1, l_2, cdots, l_k ) are even positive integers. 5. To proceed, let's prove the statement by induction on the number of non-real roots, denoted ( m ). 6. **Base Case:** If ( m = 0 ), then by assumption, ( P(x) ) only has real roots, all with even multiplicity. Hence, such a polynomial can be written as: [ P(x) = left( Q_1(x) right)^2, ] where ( Q_1(x) ) is a real polynomial. 7. **Inductive Step:** Suppose the statement holds for polynomials with fewer than ( m ) non-real roots. Now, let ( P(x) ) have exactly ( m ) non-real roots. 8. If ( P(x) ) has a pair of non-real conjugate roots, say ( beta ) and ( bar{beta} ), then it can be factored as: [ P(x) = (x^2 + 2px + q) R(x), ] where ( p = text{Re}(beta) ) and ( q = |beta|^2 = (text{Re}(beta))^2 + (text{Im}(beta))^2 ).

Let us assume one spider, say Spider 1, initially stays stationary while controlling one of the faces of the cube, say face A_{1}. 2. The other spider, Spider 2, starts to chase the ant along the edges of the cube towards the face opposite to A_{1}, which we will call A_{2}. 3. Throughout this chase, the maximum distance between Spider 2 and the ant is 2 edge lengths because they are confined to the edges of the cube. 4. As the ant moves, it essentially transfers from one face to another. No matter where the ant moves, it will eventually come near the face controlled by Spider 1. 5. When the ant reaches or moves towards face A_{1} or face A_{2}, its distance to the nearest spider will be minimized.

Additionally, ( p mid 101p ) divides the sum of numbers in each ( 101 times 101(p-1) ) rectangle. Therefore, ( p mid S_2 ). 8. **Difference of sums**: Since ( p mid S_1 ) and ( p mid S_2 ), it follows that ( p mid (S_1 - S_2) ). This implies that ( p ) divides the sum of the numbers in the ( 101 times 101 ) square. 9. **Contradiction**: Since ( p ) is an arbitrary prime greater than 101, the sum of the numbers in the ( 101 times 101 ) square must be divisible by infinitely many primes, which is impossible for a finite sum of natural numbers. 10. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the assumption that it is possible to write a natural number in every cell of an infinite chessboard such that the sum of numbers in every ( m times n ) rectangle is divisible by ( m + n ) for all ( m, n > 100 ) leads to a contradiction.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define Inversions**: - An \\"inversion\\" is defined as a scenario where a red chip is to the left of a blue chip. 2. **Initial Inversion Count**: - Initially, the number of inversions is 1 (since the red chip is to the left of the blue chip). 3. **Effect of Operations on Inversions**: - **Insertion Operation**: - Inserting two red chips in the middle of a segment of ( k ) blue chips leads to an increase in the inversion count by ( 2k ) (each of the ( k ) blue chips pairs with the two new red chips to form inversions). - Inserting two blue chips in the middle of a segment of ( k ) red chips also increases the inversion count by ( 2k ). - In both cases, the parity (even or odd nature) of the inversion count remains unchanged. - **Removal Operation**: - Removing two adjacent red chips or two adjacent blue chips does not change the parity of the inversion count. 4. **Parity Invariance**: - By analyzing the operations, we find that neither insertion nor removal changes the parity of the total number of inversions. - Therefore, the parity of the inversion count is invariant under these operations. 5. **Desired Final State**: - In the desired final state (red chip on the right and blue chip on the left), the number of inversions would be 0. 6. **Comparing Parity**: - Initial inversion count = 1 (odd). - Desired inversion count = 0 (even). - Since the parity of the inversion count cannot change with the allowed operations, reaching a final state where the number of inversions is 0 is impossible.

Before the sale, she had 27 llamas, which included the 6 calves that were not traded and the 2 new adult llamas she got from the trade.

A great white shark has double the sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark, so we calculate: Sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark = 180 + 30 Sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark = 210 Number of teeth of a great white shark = 2 * Sum of teeth of a tiger shark and a hammerhead shark Number of teeth of a great white shark = 2 * 210 Number of teeth of a great white shark = 420 Now, let's find out how many teeth a mako shark has.

This is because any two lines that intersect define a plane, and if a third line intersects both but not at the same point, it must also lie in that plane to intersect them. In this case, only one plane is determined by the intersection of the three lines, which gives us a possibility of determining 1 plane.

Thus, for any integer (N), there exists a power of 2 whose last (N) digits are all ones and twos, as required. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Calculate the limit of the function: [ lim _{x rightarrow 2} frac{x^{3}3 x2}{x2} ]","completion":"1.

For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. If Delta < 0, the equation has no real roots. In our case, a = m + 2, b = -1, and c = m.

Start by considering the case when (a = b = c = 1): [ frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{1 cdot 1 cdot 1} = frac{m}{1 + 1 + 1} ] Simplifying the left-hand side: [ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ frac{m}{3} ] Equate the two simplified expressions: [ 4 = frac{m}{3} implies m = 4 cdot 3 = 12 ] Hence, (m = 12) when (a=b=c=1). 3. Now we need to verify that there are infinitely many positive integer solutions for the equation (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} + frac{1}{abc} = frac{12}{a+b+c}). 4. Express the equation in a common form and let (f(a, b, c) = (a^2(b+c) + b^2(c+a) + c^2(a+b) + a + b + c - 9abc)): [ frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} + frac{1}{abc} - frac{12}{a+b+c} = frac{f(a, b, c)}{abc(a + b + c)} ] For the equation to hold, (f(a, b, c) = 0). 5. Define (a_0 = a_1 = a_2 = 1) and: [ a_{n+2} = frac{a_n a_{n+1} + 1}{a_{n-1}} ] We need to prove the recursion maintains (a_{n}) as integers and satisfies the equation. 6. We must prove by induction: - **Base case (n=1):** [ a_{1} = 1, a_{2} = 1 ] Both are clearly valid solutions. - **Inductive step:** Assume (a_n), (a_{n+1}) and (a_{n+2}) are integers and the relations hold, then show: [ (i) quad a_{n-1} mid a_n a_{n+1} + 1 ] [ (ii) quad a_n mid a_{n-1} + a_{n+1} ] [ (iii) quad a_{n+1} mid a_n a_{n-1} + 1 ] Prove each case using the recursive relation defined: - (i) (a_k mid a_{k+1}a_{k+2} + 1) Consider the recursive definition: [ a_{k+2} = frac{a_{k} a_{k+1} + 1}{a_{k-1}} ] Thus, [ a_{k+2}a_{k-1} = a_{k}a_{k+1} + 1 implies a_{k}a_{k+1} equiv -1 , (text{mod}, a_{k-1}) ] - (ii) (a_{k+1} mid a_k + a_{k+2}) Substitute the recursive formula: [ a_{k+2} = frac{a_{k+1}a_k + 1}{a_{k-1}} ] Then, [ a_k + a_{k+2} = a_k + frac{a_{k+1}a_k + 1}{a_{k-1}} ] Reduced and shown (a_{k+1}) divides (a_k + a_{k+2}). - (iii) (a_{k+2} mid a_{k+1} a_k + 1) Given by: [ a_{k+2} = frac{a_k a_{k+1} + 1}{a_{k-1}} ] Therefore, [ a_{k+2}a_{k-1} = a_k a_{k+1} + 1 ] Leading to required divisibility. 7.

By symmetry, both points will lie in the middle of their respective sides of this square. 3. Note that the top square face of the box is formed by the regular pentagons, and its side length needs to be determined. Considering that pentagons are regular with each side = 1, the arrangement creates an edge of the square face equal to 2. 4. Each side of this square is 2 (as deduced from the regular pentagon's arrangement). 5. Thus, the distance between (A) and (B), which are at the midpoints of opposite sides of the square, is simply the length of the diagonal of the square. 6. To find the midpoint to midpoint distance (AB): - Calculate half the diagonal of the square with side length 2: [ text{Diagonal Length} = sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{4 + 4} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2} ] - Since (A) and (B) are at the midpoints of opposite sides, the distance (AB) is half the diagonal: [ AB = frac{2sqrt{2}}{2} = sqrt{2} ] 7.

Next, we identify the intervals for \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" times: - At any two time points ( t ), one interval will be \\"good\\" if the minute hand meets the hour hand before the second hand. - The other interval where the meeting sequence is opposite will be \\"bad\\". 8. Each full cycle from 12:00 PM to 12:00 AM and then back from 12:00 AM to 12:00 PM can be considered to split equally: - Good and bad intervals are therefore symmetric and equally distributed throughout the day. 9. Because the lengths of \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" intervals match in a complete 24-hour cycle, it indicates that the total amount of \\"good\\" time in a day is exactly the same as the \\"bad\\" time. # Conclusion: Thus, the total duration of \\"good\\" time is equal to the total duration of \\"bad\\" time within a 24-hour period.

The \\".exe\\" extension indicates that the file is an executable, which can run programs. Executable files obtained from unverified or suspicious sources often contain malware that can compromise security systems. 3. **Recommendations to Avoid Such Problems:** - **Do Not Share Phone Numbers on Untrusted Sites:** Users should avoid sharing their phone numbers or personal information on websites unless they are verified and trustworthy. According to guidelines by cellular operators, confirming paid GSM subscriptions does not require anything beyond entering the phone number. Click-through agreements on suspicious pages should be avoided. - **Do Not Download Files from Untrusted Sources:** Files from unverified sources should not be downloaded, as they may be harmful. Always ensure that websites from which files are downloaded have a good reputation and are secure. - **Pay Attention to File Extensions:** Be cautious with file extensions. Double extensions (like \`doc.exe\`, \`pdf.exe\`) are a common sign of malicious software. The executable nature of the file (\`.exe\`) should raise an alarm, especially if it is disguised as a document (\`.pdf\` or other). 4. **Alternative Approach to Avoid Issues:** To avoid such problems in the future, the minions could have: - Searched for the recipe on more reputable and well-known websites. - Not entered any personal data without consulting Gru or verifying the legitimacy of the website. - Not opened or downloaded files with suspicious or unfamiliar extensions without proper verification. **Conclusion:** To prevent similar incidents: - Never submit personal information on suspicious websites. - Avoid downloading files from unknown or untrusted sources. - Pay close attention to file types and be alert for double extensions which often signify malicious content.

Dividing 2005 by 4, we get 2005 = 4 times 501 + 1, so n = 501 and r = 1. Now we will use the property f(x + 8) = f(x) + f(4) to express f(2005) in terms of known function values within [0, 4]. Because 8 divides evenly into 4n, we can apply the relation iteratively: f(2005) = f(4 times 501 + 1) = f(4 times 500 + 1 + 8). By applying the relation f(x + 8) = f(x) + f(4) multiple times, we get: f(4 times 500 + 1 + 8) = f(4 times 500 + 1) + f(4). Since 4 times 500 = 2000 is divisible by 8, we can continue in this manner, subtracting 8 from the argument each time and adding f(4) to the value: f(2000 + 1) = f(2000) + f(1) + f(4).

Without knowledge of the exact value of x, we must consider several cases: 1. **Case 1**: When x leq 8, the data in ascending order is x, 8, 10, 10. The median is 9 at this point, and so we have: frac{28 + x}{4} = 9 Solving for x, we find x = 8. Therefore, in this case, the median is boxed{9}. 2. **Case 2**: When 8 < x leq 10, the data in ascending order is 8, x, 10, 10. The median is frac{x + 10}{2} at this stage. Thus, we equate the means: frac{28 + x}{4} = frac{x + 10}{2} Solving for x here gives x = 8, which does not satisfy 8 < x leq 10. Hence, there is no x that fits this case. 3. **Case 3**: When x geq 10, the data in ascending order is 8, 10, 10, x. The median then is 10, so we have: frac{28 + x}{4} = 10 Solving for x, we get x = 12. So, in this case, the median is boxed{10}. Based on the above, the median of the data set can be either 9 or 10 depending on the value of x. To determine the median, we must ensure the data is sorted and then apply the definition of the median according to whether there is an odd or even number of data points. For an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value. For an even number of data points, as in this case, the median is the average of the two middle values after sorting the data set in ascending order."},{"prompt":"Solve the equation: frac{2}{x4}+3=frac{x2}{4x}.","completion":"To solve the equation frac{2}{x-4}+3=frac{x-2}{4-x}, we first observe that the denominators on both sides can be related by a sign change, since 4-x = -(x-4).

We can do this by finding a common denominator, which in this case can be x-4 (or equivalently, 4-x), and multiplying both sides of the equation by this common denominator. However, noticing that frac{x-2}{4-x} can be rewritten as frac{x-2}{-(x-4)} = -frac{x-2}{x-4} simplifies our task. The equation becomes: [ 2 + 3(x-4) = -(x-2). ] Step 2: Simplify both sides.

Therefore, the combined speed of the boat and the current is (26 + c) km/hr. The wind affects the boat's speed with a 10% efficiency.

Let's consider that each team i plays home games in the weeks represented by set S_i: - We assume S_i subseteq {1, 2, 3, 4}, forall i in {1, 2, ldots, 7} where S_i represents the weeks in which team i has home games. By the pigeonhole principle, since there are 7 teams but only 4 weeks, there must be at least two teams, say i and j (i neq j), such that S_i and S_j must overlap: |S_i cup S_j| leq 4 - This overlap means one team’s home games will coincide with another team’s home games, violating the constraint that no team can have an away game scheduled in a week it has a home game. - For example, if |S_i| = k and |S_j| = l where k geq 2, l geq 2. Then the combined (k+l) games need more distinct weeks, making them contradictory to 'at most 4’ rule. Thus, due to the overlap, it is impossible for all 7 teams to complete all their home and away games in just 4 weeks, whereas it works perfectly for 6 teams with the proposed schedule.

Let's denote the side of the square as ( s = 12 ). Let ( t ) be the side length of each equilateral triangle, which will have a vertex on a vertex of the square and one side common with another triangle. First, determine the side length of the triangles. Given that three triangles meet at the center and share a common vertex at the center, the side length ( t ) can be determined by setting the perimeter of the triangles equal to the perimeter of the square (since they cover all four sides). Since one side of each triangle is ( t ) and there are three sides in total per triangle, the total length covered is ( 3t ). We equate ( 3t ) to the side of the square: [ 3t = 12 ] [ t = 4 ] Now, calculate the height ( h ) of the equilateral triangle since it will affect the maximum size of the square that can be inscribed. The height ( h ) of an equilateral triangle is given by: [ h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} t = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times 4 = 2sqrt{3} ] We now consider the largest inscribed square.

[ text{Average height} = frac{160 + 169 + 169}{3} = frac{498}{3} = 166 text{ cm} ] - Out of these, only one sailor (160 cm) is eligible (height ≤ 168 cm). - Therefore, at least half of the sailors in Team A may not be eligible due to having one eligible sailor out of three. 2. **Analyze Team B:** - The median height of sailors is 167 cm. - By definition, the median is the middle value when the heights are ordered. - This means at least half the sailors are 167 cm or shorter. - Consequently, at least half of the sailors can serve on the submarine as their heights do not exceed 168 cm. - If there are more sailors shorter than or equal to 167 cm, they are also eligible. 3. **Analyze Team C:** - The tallest sailor has a height of 169 cm. - Whether there are more sailors or their other heights are not mentioned explicitly within the acceptable range. - An example provided: Two sailors both with heights of 169 cm. - If all sailors have heights of 169 cm, none would be eligible. - Thus, this team does not give a clear indication that at least half can serve. 4. **Analyze Team D:** - The mode height of the sailors is 167 cm. - This means 167 cm is the most frequent height among the sailors. - Example: Five sailors with heights 167 cm, 167 cm, 169 cm, 170 cm, and 171 cm. - Out of these, only two sailors (167 cm) are eligible. - Hence, less than half might be eligible due to having three out of five exceeding the height limit. # Conclusion: By the height constraints for serving on the submarine (height ≤ 168 cm), Team B is identified as the only team where at least half of the sailors can serve since the median height ensures at least half of them do not exceed 167 cm.

We know that sin alpha cos alpha = frac{1}{2}sin 2alpha. The range of sin 2alpha is [-1, 1], so frac{1}{2}sin 2alpha in left[-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}right]. Since 1 is not in this interval, proposition A is incorrect. **Proposition B**: There exists a real number alpha such that sin alpha + cos alpha = sqrt{2}. We can rewrite sin alpha + cos alpha as sqrt{2}sinleft(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right). For sin alpha + cos alpha = sqrt{2} to be true, we need sinleft(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right) = 1. This happens when alpha + frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi, or alpha = frac{pi}{4} + 2kpi where k in mathbb{Z}. Therefore, proposition B is correct. **Proposition C**: The function y = sinleft(frac{3}{2}pi + xright) is an even function. Let's consider f(x) = sinleft(frac{3pi}{2} + xright). We can simplify this to f(x) = -cos x. For a function to be even, f(x) = f(-x). Here, f(-x) = -cos(-x) = -cos x = f(x). Thus, proposition C is correct because f(x) is indeed an even function. **Proposition D**: If alpha and beta are angles in the first quadrant, and alpha > beta, then sin alpha > sin beta.

Since the minimum positive period T of the function is given by T = pi, and we know that the period of a sine function Asin(wx) is frac{2pi}{w}, we can set up the equation T = frac{2pi}{w}: pi = frac{2pi}{w} implies w = 2.

This means that: sin(2x + frac{pi}{6}) in [-frac{1}{2}, 1]. Given that the maximum value of f(x) in the interval x in [0, frac{pi}{2}] is 4, we can conclude that: f_{text{max}}(x) = A = 4.

Let F and G be the points where the diameter intersects the chords BD and CE respectively. 2. **Calculate the Lengths of Segments**: Since the chords are 8 inches apart and the diameter is perpendicular to them, the segments AF and AG each measure half the distance between the chords, i.e., AF = AG = 4 inches. 3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem**: In right triangles AFB, AFD, AEG, and AGC, we have: [ OF = OG = sqrt{8^2 - 4^2} = sqrt{64 - 16} = sqrt{48} = 4sqrt{3} text{ inches} ] Therefore, BF = DF = EG = GC = 4sqrt{3} inches. 4. **Calculate the Area of Triangles**: The area of triangle AFB (similarly for AFD, AEG, and AGC) is: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times AF times BF = frac{1}{2} times 4 times 4sqrt{3} = 8sqrt{3} text{ square inches} ] Thus, the total area of triangles BAD and CAE is 16sqrt{3} square inches. 5. **Calculate the Area of Sectors**: The angle theta subtended by the chord at the center is 60^circ (since triangle AFB is a 30-60-90 triangle).

Therefore, it was not possible for Alexander to allocate his funds more advantageously in 2020 to cover the increased cost of buckwheat. 6. **Conclusion for Part (a):** Thus, it would not have been financially advantageous for Alexander to invest in any of the described deposit schemes instead of buying buckwheat. The amount would still fall short of the 100 RUB required to buy 1 kg of buckwheat.

[ 2x^2 + 2021x + 2019 = 0 ] 3. **Calculate the discriminant**: The discriminant (Delta) for a quadratic equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) is given by the formula: [ Delta = b^2 - 4ac ] Here, (a = 2), (b = 2021), and (c = 2019). Substituting in the values, we get: [ Delta = 2021^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot 2019 ] Simplify the expression: [ Delta = 4084441 - 16152 ] [ Delta = 4068290 ] 4. **Find the roots**: The roots of the quadratic equation are given by the formula: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{Delta}}{2a} ] Substituting (a = 2), (b = 2021), and (Delta = 4068290): [ x = frac{-2021 pm sqrt{4068290}}{2 cdot 2} ] Simplify: [ x = frac{-2021 pm sqrt{4068290}}{4} ] 5. **Calculate the approximate values of the roots**: We need to find the approximate values of (sqrt{4068290}): [ sqrt{4068290} approx 2017.35 text{ (using a calculator or approximation techniques)} ] Thus, the roots are approximately: [ x_1 approx frac{-2021 + 2017.35}{4} = frac{-3.65}{4} approx -0.9125 ] [ x_2 approx frac{-2021 - 2017.35}{4} = frac{-4038.35}{4} approx -1009.5875 ] 6. **Determine the interval**: The quadratic expression (2x^2 + 2021x + 2019) is negative or zero between the roots (x_2) and (x_1).

A: The sum of the coefficients of the odd terms is 256 B: The coefficient of the 6th term is the largest C: There exists a constant term D: There are a total of 6 rational term","completion":"To solve the given problem, we follow a step-by-step approach based on the provided solution: 1. **Finding the sum of the coefficients**: The sum of the coefficients of the expansion of ({asqrt{x}+frac{1}{{{x^2}}}})^{10} can be found by substituting x=1. This gives us the sum as (a+1)^{10}. Given that this sum equals 1024, we have: [ (a+1)^{10} = 1024 ] Simplifying, we find: [ a+1 = 2^2 = 4 ] Therefore, a = 4 - 1 = 3. However, since a > 0, and we are looking for a that makes the sum 1024, we correctly adjust to find: [ a+1 = 2^{10/2} = 2^5 ] Leading to a = 2^5 - 1 = 31. This is a misinterpretation in the simplification process. Correctly, solving (a+1)^{10} = 1024 gives us: [ a+1 = 2 ] So, a = 1. This means the binomial simplifies to {(sqrt{x}+frac{1}{{x}^{2}})}^{10}. 2. **Sum of the coefficients of the odd terms**: For the sum of the coefficients of the odd terms, by the nature of binomial expansion, we find it to be 2^{9} = 512. This is because, in a binomial expansion, the sum of the coefficients of all terms equals the sum of the coefficients when x=1, and for odd terms specifically, it's half of the total sum for this case. Thus, statement A is incorrect because it claims the sum is 256. 3. **Coefficient of the 6th term**: The general term of the expansion is given by T_{r+1} = {C}_{10}^{r} cdot {x}^{frac{10-5r}{2}}. For the coefficient of the 6th term to be the largest, we set r=5 and find that indeed, this term has the largest coefficient, making statement B correct. 4. **Existence of a constant term**: To find a constant term, we set the exponent of x to 0, which gives frac{10-5r}{2} = 0. Solving for r gives r=2. This means there is a constant term in the expansion, making statement C correct. 5. **Number of rational terms**: For a term to be rational, the exponent of x must be an integer. Setting frac{10-5r}{2} to be an integer, we find valid r values to be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. This indicates there are 6 rational terms in the expansion, making statement D correct.

We know that (125 = 5^3), so we can rewrite the equation as: [log_x 5^3 + log_5 5^3 = k] Using the power rule of logarithms, which states that (log_b a^c = c cdot log_b a), we can simplify the equation: [3 cdot log_x 5 + 3 cdot log_5 5 = k] Since (log_5 5 = 1), the equation becomes: [3 cdot log_x 5 + 3 = k] Now, we can solve for (log_x 5): [log_x 5 = frac{k - 3}{3}] Since (k) is a whole number, (frac{k - 3}{3}) must also be a whole number.

These are 3, 5, 6, and 9. (Note that we don't include 15 because it's not a single-digit number.) Next, let's list the prime numbers less than 50: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47. Now, we want to find the probability that the product of a randomly selected number from the first set and a randomly selected number from the second set is a multiple of 135. 135 can be factored into prime factors as 3 x 3 x 3 x 5 (or (3^3 times 5)). So, for a product to be a multiple of 135, it must include at least three factors of 3 and one factor of 5. Let's see which combinations of our selected numbers can give us this: - For the factor of 5, we can only use the number 5 from the first set. - For the factors of 3, we can use 3, 6, or 9 from the first set. However, since we need three factors of 3, we can only use 9 (which is (3^2)) and then we need another 3 from the prime numbers set. So, the only combinations that will work are: - 5 (from the first set) multiplied by any prime number that is a multiple of 3 from the second set (which is only the prime number 3). - 9 (from the first set) multiplied by 5 (from the second set). Now, let's count the successful outcomes: - There is 1 successful outcome for the combination of 5 and 3. - There is 1 successful outcome for the combination of 9 and 5. So, there are 2 successful outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of elements in the first set multiplied by the number of elements in the second set, which is 4 (multiples of 3 or 5) times 15 (prime numbers less than 50), giving us 60 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability that the product will be a multiple of 135 is the number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes, which is ( frac{2}{60} ) or ( frac{1}{30} ).

By similar reasoning, vectors overrightarrow{OA_1}, overrightarrow{OB_1}, overrightarrow{OC_1}, overrightarrow{OD_1} represent the vertices of the second pentagon with a common vertex O. 3. **Expression for Vector overrightarrow{OC}**: Since OABC D is a regular pentagon, we can write: [ overrightarrow{OC} = lambda overrightarrow{OA} + mu overrightarrow{OB} ] where lambda and mu are constants. 4. **Expression for Vector overrightarrow{OC_1}**: Since OA_1B_1C_1D_1 is similarly a regular pentagon (related by scale and orientation), we can express: [ overrightarrow{OC_1} = lambda overrightarrow{OA_1} + mu overrightarrow{OB_1} ] 5. **Deriving overrightarrow{CC_1}**: Using the above expressions for overrightarrow{OC} and overrightarrow{OC_1}, we find: [ overrightarrow{CC_1} = overrightarrow{OC_1} - overrightarrow{OC} = (lambda overrightarrow{OA_1} + mu overrightarrow{OB_1}) - (lambda overrightarrow{OA} + mu overrightarrow{OB}) ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ overrightarrow{CC_1} = lambda ( overrightarrow{OA_1} - overrightarrow{OA} ) + mu (overrightarrow{OB_1} - overrightarrow{OB} ) ] Hence, [ overrightarrow{CC_1} = lambda overrightarrow{A A_1} + mu overrightarrow{B B_1} ] 6. **Parallelism to a Plane Pi**: From the expression of overrightarrow{CC_1}, it is clear that overrightarrow{CC_1} lies in the plane determined by overrightarrow{AA_1} and overrightarrow{BB_1} because it is a linear combination of these vectors.

The six differences are: [ (a - b), (a - c), (a - d), (b - c), (b - d), (c - d) ] Let's analyze the differences modulo 12. Step 1: Consider modulo 3 There are four integers, and there are only three possible residues modulo 3: (0, 1,) and (2). By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these integers must have the same residue modulo 3. Suppose (a equiv b pmod{3}). Then: [ a - b equiv 0 pmod{3} ] This implies that (a - b) is divisible by 3. So, at least one of the differences is divisible by 3. Step 2: Consider modulo 2 (parity) Similarly, look at the residue of these integers modulo 2. There are only two possible residues: (0 ) and ( 1 ), representing even and odd. Again, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these integers must have the same parity. Without loss of generality, assume ( a equiv b pmod{2} ). Then: [ a - b equiv 0 pmod{2} ] This implies that (a - b) is even. So, at least one of the differences is even (divisible by 2). Now we need to find a second even difference when there are four such numbers. Step 3: Finding a second even difference. **Case 1: At least three numbers have the same parity.** Suppose (a, b,) and (c) are all even (or all odd). Then: [ a - c equiv 0 pmod{2} qquad text{and} qquad b - c equiv 0 pmod{2} ] Another difference ( a - b ) is certainly even, confirming another even difference. **Case 2: There are exactly two even and two odd numbers.** Without loss of generality, let’s say ( a ) and ( b ) are even, while ( c ) and ( d ) are odd. Thus: [ a - b equiv 0 pmod{2} ] Additionally, since (c) and (d) are both odd: [ c - d equiv 0 pmod{2} ] So, at least two differences are even as well. Conclusion: Divisibility by 3 and 4 - As shown, at least one difference is divisible by 3. - We have at least two differences divisible by 2. The product of two even numbers guarantees a factor of 4. Together, 3 from above and 4 from the product of even differences ensure that the entire product of all six differences is divisible by ( text{lcm}(3, 4) = 12).

Specifically, it is the first red light of the second group, which is at position 6 (since 5 lights complete one group). - To find the 21st red light, we note that every two groups (10 lights) contain 4 red lights. Thus, the 20th red light is at the end of the 10th group (10 groups * 5 lights/group = 50 lights). The 21st red light is the first red light in the 11th group, at position 51. 3. **Calculate the number of lights between the 3rd and 21st red lights**: The lights between them are from position 7 to position 50, inclusive.

The coordinates of D are given by the average of the coordinates of B and C, yielding Dleft(frac{-1+3}{2}, frac{1+3}{2}right) = (1, 2). Next, we find the slope k_{BC} of line segment BC using the coordinates of B and C: k_{BC}= frac{y_C-y_B}{x_C-x_B} = frac{3-1}{3-(-1)} = frac{1}{2}. The slope of the perpendicular bisector of side BC is the negative reciprocal of k_{BC}, which is -2.

Let's denote the masses of the iron weights by ( m_1, m_2, ldots, m_{10} ), and the masses of the bronze balls by ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{10} ). 2. According to the problem, each bronze ball is placed between two iron weights. The mass of each bronze ball is equal to the absolute difference of the masses of the two adjacent iron weights. So, we have the following relationships: [ x_i = left| m_i - m_{(i+1) mod 10} right| ] for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 10 ). 3. If we consider the sum of the masses of all bronze balls, we get: [ x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_{10} = left| m_1 - m_2 right| + left| m_2 - m_3 right| + ldots + left| m_{10} - m_1 right| ] 4. Each ( m_i ) appears in the sum exactly twice, once with a positive sign and once with a negative sign.

This implies f(x) is decreasing in (0,1) and increasing in (1,+infty). Step 3: Find the Minimum Value of f(x) The minimum value of f(x) occurs at x=1, so f(x)_{min}=f(1)=e+1-a. Step 4: Ensure f(x) geqslant 0 To ensure f(x) geqslant 0 for all x in the domain, we need e+1-a geqslant 0. Solving this inequality gives a leqslant e+1.

Therefore, we have boxed{(-infty, e+1]}. # Part (2): Proving x_{1}x_{2} < 1 Step 1: Given Conditions Since f(x) has two zeros and f(1)=e+1-a < 0, it implies a > e+1. Assuming 0 < x_{1} < 1 < x_{2}. Step 2: Define a New Function h(x) Define h(x)=f(x)-fleft(frac{1}{x}right) for 0 < x < 1. We aim to show h(x) < 0 to prove x_{1}x_{2} < 1. Step 3: Derivative of h(x) The derivative of h(x) is h'(x)=f'(x)-left[fleft(frac{1}{x}right)right]'=frac{(x-1)(e^{x}+x-xe^{frac{1}{x}}-1)}{x^{2}}. Step 4: Analyze the Function m(x) Define m(x)=e^{x}+x-xe^{frac{1}{x}}-1 and find its derivative m'(x)=e^{x}+1-e^{frac{1}{x}}left(1-frac{1}{x}right). Since 0 < x < 1, m'(x) > 0, implying m(x) is increasing in (0,1) and m(x) < m(1)=0. Step 5: Conclude h(x) is Increasing Since x-1 < 0 and m(x) < 0, h'(x) > 0 in (0,1), implying h(x) is increasing. Given h(1)=0, we have h(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1. Final Answer for Part (2) Since h(x) < 0 implies f(x_{1}) < fleft(frac{1}{x_{1}}right), we conclude x_{1}x_{2} < 1.

The method of distribution is: - For even-indexed intermediate subsets (like (2k)), distribute elements from largest to smallest into (A_1, A_2, dots, A_{117}). - For odd-indexed intermediate subsets (like (2k+1)), distribute elements from smallest to largest into (A_1, A_2, dots, A_{117}).

This is a downward-opening parabola with the axis of symmetry being the line x = 1. Steps to finding the range of a: 1. **Find the vertex of the parabola**: The vertex form of a parabola is y = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. For the given function f(x) = -x^2 + 2x, we complete the square to find its vertex.

Therefore, the maximum f(x) when x in (0, 2) is f(1) = 1. 3. **Find a such that a < f(x) for all x**: Since a must be less than the minimum value of f(x) within the interval (0, 2), we need to find this minimum value. The parabola opens downward and the ends of the parabola approach -infty as x moves away from the vertex in either direction.

We'll break this down into cases based on the rolls: 1. **All three rolls are the same:** The only way this can happen to sum to 9 is if all three dice show a 3, which is (3,3,3).

Lemma 3.1.3 implies that if E(G) = E(G^*), the non-empty edge sets of G correspond to blocks in G, which also correspond to blocks in G^*. 7. **Lemma 3.1.2:** - This lemma might contrast the blocks in G and G^*, implying that the blocks in G^* are the same as the blocks in G. # Conclusion: Combining all these intermediate steps, we conclude that for a graph G, its cycle space mathcal{C}(G) is equivalent to the cut space mathcal{C}^*(G^*) of its dual G^*.

Let the radius of the circles be (r). **Step 4:** Geometric Properties and Symmetry Consider the point (K) as the center of the triangle (ABC) and let (KA, KB, KC) be the axes of symmetry passing through vertices (A, B, C). Let these axes intersect the arcs (BC, CA, AB) at points (A_1, B_1, C_1). Since the shapes (K B_1 A C_1), (K C_1 B A_1), and (K A_1 C B_1) are congruent due to reflections across the symmetry axes, it's natural to assume a solution where our circles (k_1, k_2, k_3) will have equal radii and will touch each pair of the triangle sides externally. **Step 5:** Validation by Construction and Calculations We investigate the construction: 1. Let (L) be the touching point of (k_1) and (k_2). 2. Considering the circle centered at (O_1) with radius (d-r) and the circle centered at (O_2) with the same property, their intersection farthest from (L) is point (M) where (LM = d). 3. Knowing (KL = KM), since (KO_1 = KO_2). Constructing the circle (k' ) passing through the arcs and finding the tangent line (t) to this circle. Important Geometric Relationships: - Utilize properties of rectangles and the fact that tangents from a point outside the circle are equal to prove symmetrical properties and distances using the Pythagorean theorem. Calculation of radii: Solve the quadratic equation formed: (d-r)^2 = r^2 + left(frac{d+r}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 Which simplifies to: (d-r)^2 = r^2 + frac{(d+r)^2}{3} Further simplified and solved, we get: r = d(3sqrt{2} - 4) Thus: r text{ is the radius of each of the circles} quad k_1, k_2, k_3. **Final box for the answer:** boxed{r = d(3sqrt{2} - 4)}"},{"prompt":"Consider the set of all points ((x,y)) in the coordinate plane for which the ycoordinate is three times the xcoordinate or the xcoordinate is three times the ycoordinate.

Both lines intersect at the origin, ((0,0)), and they divide the plane into four distinct regions: 1. Above both lines. 2. Between the lines. 3. Below both lines. 4.

Extend the angle's sides and consider an arbitrary point ( F ) on the angle bisector. Draw two lines through ( F ), each intersecting the sides of the angle. 2. Let the intersections of the first line with the angle sides be ( A ) and ( B ) at distances ( a ) and ( b ) from ( O ), respectively. The intersections of the second line with the angle sides are ( A' ) and ( B' ) at distances ( a' ) and ( b' ) from ( O ). 3. Reflect the intersecting line through the angle bisector, resulting in points ( A^* ) and ( B^* ). Draw a perpendicular line from ( F ) to the angle bisector; this line will be the angle bisector of ( angle BFA^* ). Let this perpendicular intersect the angle side ( OB ) at point ( C ) and denote ( OC = c ). 4. Using the angle bisector theorem in triangle ( BFA^* ) (which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite segment in the ratio of the other two sides): [ frac{CB}{CA^*} = frac{BF}{A^*F} ] Substituting ( CB = c - b ), ( CA^* = a - c ), we get: [ frac{c - b}{a - c} = frac{BF}{A^*F} ] 5. Apply the external angle bisector theorem to triangle ( OF ): [ frac{OB}{OA^*} = frac{BF}{A^*F}, quad text{so} quad frac{b}{a} = frac{BF}{A^*F} ] 6. Comparing these ratios, we obtain: [ frac{c - b}{a - c} = frac{b}{a} ] Simplify by cross-multiplying: [ a(c - b) = b(a - c) ] Distribute and collect terms: [ ac - ab = ab - bc ] [ ac + bc = 2ab ] 7. Divide both sides by ( abc ): [ frac{a}{abc} + frac{c}{abc} = frac{2ab}{abc} ] Simplify: [ frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{a} = frac{2}{c} ] 8.

This repetition suggests that E's ranking is correctly guessed by at least one person, making it highly probable that E is indeed in the 4th place. 2. **Determining E's Position**: Given that E is in the 4th place, we can confirm that the guesses related to E's position by B and C are correct. This also means that D cannot be in the 4th place, contradicting B's guess that E and D are in the 4th and 5th places, respectively. 3. **Identifying B's Position**: Since only A made a guess about B's position, stating that B is in the 3rd place, and considering our analysis so far supports the uniqueness of correct guesses, B must indeed be in the 3rd place. 4. **Placing A and C**: A's position was guessed by C to be in the 1st place, and C's position was guessed by A to be in the 5th place.

According to the problem, Pat charged twice as much time as Kate, so Pat charged 2K hours. Mark charged 80 hours more than Kate, so Mark charged K + 80 hours. The total hours charged to the project by all three is 144 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation: K (Kate's hours) + 2K (Pat's hours) + (K + 80) (Mark's hours) = 144 Combining like terms, we get: K + 2K + K + 80 = 144 4K + 80 = 144 Subtract 80 from both sides to solve for K: 4K = 144 - 80 4K = 64 Divide both sides by 4 to find K: K = 64 / 4 K = 16 Now we know Kate charged 16 hours to the project. Pat charged twice as much as Kate, so Pat charged: 2 * 16 = 32 hours Mark charged 80 hours more than Kate, so Mark charged: 16 + 80 = 96 hours The ratio of the time charged by Pat to the time charged by Mark is: Pat's hours : Mark's hours 32 : 96 To simplify the ratio, divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 32: (32/32) : (96/32) 1 : 3 Therefore, the ratio of the time charged by Pat to the time charged by Mark is boxed{1:3} ."},{"prompt":"Calculate the sum of the areas of all triangles whose vertices are also vertices of a (2) by (3) by (4) rectangular prism, where each triangle is entirely within one face of the prism.","completion":"Each face of the rectangular prism lies in a plane and is a rectangle; the prism has six faces each defined by two adjacent edges: 1.

To achieve this, consider any ( i ) such that ( 1 leq i leq n ), and let ( k_i ) be the smallest integer satisfying ( 2^{k_i} leq a_i < 2^{k_i+1} ). Thus, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{2^{k_{i}}} < sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{2}{a_{i}} leq 1. ] Next, we will choose a residue class modulo ( 2^{k_i} ), denoted as ( A_i ), ensuring that these residue classes ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) are pairwise disjoint. Assume that ( k_1 leq k_2 leq cdots leq k_n ). Let us select ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) in this order, with ( A_1 ) being chosen arbitrarily. Suppose ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{i-1} ) have already been selected. Note that for any ( j < i ), the set ( A_j ) contains at most ( 2^{k_i - k_j} ) different residue classes modulo ( 2^{k_i} ). For each ( j ) such that ( 1 leq j leq i-1 ), if we define: [ A_j = left{ p cdot 2^{k_j} + t mid p in mathbb{Z}_{+}, 1 leq t leq 2^{k_j} right}, ] then: [ left( p + 2^{k_i - k_j} right) 2^{k_j} + t = p cdot 2^{k_j} + 2^{k_i} + t equiv p cdot 2^{k_j} + t pmod{2^{k_i}}. ] This implies that the sequence ( { p cdot 2^{k_j} + t } (p in mathbb{N}) ) with respect to ( 2^{k_i} ) is periodic with a period of ( 2^{k_i - k_j} ). Thus, the number of distinct residue classes ( A_j ) can belong to modulo ( 2^{k_i} ) is at most ( 2^{k_i - k_j} ). Using equation (1), we have: [ sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^{k_i - k_j} < 2^{k_i} sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^{-k_j} < 2^{k_i} sum_{j=1}^{n} frac{1}{2^{k_j}} leq 2^{k_i}. ] Thus, we can select such ( A_i ).

If there exists ( 1 leq j leq n ) such that ( m in A_j ), then the ( j )-th indicator is reduced to 1, and the other indicators increase by 1 from the indicators in the ((m-1))-th year. If ( m ) does not belong to any ( A_j ), then each indicator number from the previous year increases by 1. Since ( A_i ) is a residue class modulo ( 2^{k_i} ) and the residue classes ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) are pairwise disjoint, there exists a unique ( 1 leq m_i leq 2^{k_i} ) such that ( m_i in A_i ) and ( m_i notin A_j ) for ( j ne i ). Therefore, for the first ( m_i - 1 ) years, the ( i )-th indicator increases by 1 each year. In the ( m_i )-th year, this indicator becomes 1. In the years from ( m_i + (k-1)2^{k_i} + 1 ) to ( m_i + k2^{k_i} - 1 ) (where ( k in mathbb{Z}_{+} )), the ( i )-th indicator increases by 1 each year, and in the ( m_i - 1 + k2^{k_i} )-th year, this indicator returns to 1. Hence, the ( i )-th indicator does not exceed ( 2^{k_i} leq a_i ). Moreover, since the residue classes ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) do not intersect, at most one indicator can decrease in value within a calendar year.
