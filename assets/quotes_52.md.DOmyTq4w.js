The zeros of ( sin z ) occur at ( z = pi k ), where ( k ) is an integer. Thus, the zeros of ( sin^4 z ), and consequently ( f(z) ), are: [ z_k = pi k, quad k = pm 1, pm 2, pm 3, ldots ] 3. **Order of Zeros**: Since ( sin z ) has simple zeros at ( z = pi k ), the function ( sin^4 z ) will have zeros of order 4 (since ( sin z ) raised to the power of 4). The factor ( z^2 ) in the denominator is non-zero at ( z_k = pi k ). This does not affect the order of the zeros because it remains non-zero at these points.

Since there are n A's, f_{AB}(sigma) = n times n = n^2. - For f_{BC}(sigma): Each B has n C's to its right. Since there are n B's, f_{BC}(sigma) = n times n = n^2. - For f_{CD}(sigma): Each C has n D's to its right.

Each good pair (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A) can be counted multiple times in different subsequences. To simplify, consider the total number of ways to select pairs (A, B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A): - For each A, there are n B's, so there are n^2 pairs (A, B). - Similarly, there are n^2 pairs (B, C) and n^2 pairs (C, D). - For pairs (D, A), each D can pair with n A's, so there are n^2 pairs (D, A).

Since y can finish the work in 15 days, y's work rate is 1/15 of the work per day. In 9 days, y would have completed: 9 * (1/15) = 9/15 = 3/5 of the work. This means that 2/5 of the work is still remaining after y leaves. Now, let's find out the combined work rate of x and z. x's work rate is 1/20 of the work per day, and z's work rate is 1/25 of the work per day.

Let us consider the triangle triangle ABC where AB > AC, and H be the orthocenter of triangle ABC. Let E be the midpoint of the segment joining point H with vertex A. Let the inscribed circle touch sides AB and AC at points C' and B', respectively. 2. We denote B_1 and C_1 as the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from B and C to AC and AB, respectively.

We will show that point F, the reflection of E about the line B'C', lies on the line passing through the centers I and O. 4. Firstly, note that points A, B_1, C_1, and H lie on a circle with diameter AH, so E is the center of this circle. Consequently, points E and O in triangle AB_1C_1 correspond to points O and E in triangle ABC through similarity. 5. Next, consider the triangle A B_1 C_1. Since triangle A B_1 C_1 sim triangle ABC with a similarity ratio k = cos alpha, where alpha = angle BAC. 6. Let L be the reflection of I about B'C'. Notice that since A I perp B'C', L will lie on the angle bisector AI. Hence, the task reduces to proving that frac{A L}{A T} = k. 7. Denote M as the midpoint of B'C'. Since triangles ACI and IC'M are similar, angle MC'I = angle C'AI = frac{alpha}{2}.

In the first configuration, each pebble in a pile of size (a_i) is given a value of (frac{1}{a_i}).

If a pebble moves from a pile of size (a_j) to a pile of size (b_i), its value changes from (frac{1}{a_j}) to (frac{1}{b_i}). Calculate this difference as: [ frac{1}{b_i} - frac{1}{a_j} ] A pebble will end up in a smaller pile if (a_j > b_i), which implies: [ frac{1}{a_j} < frac{1}{b_i} quad text{or} quad 0 < frac{1}{b_i} - frac{1}{a_j} ] Therefore, when a pebble moves to a smaller pile, the difference (frac{1}{b_i} - frac{1}{a_j}) is positive.

We then have: [ leftlfloor frac{n+2}{n} u_{n-1} rightrfloor = leftlfloor A cdot frac{(n+2)}{2n} cdot n(n+1) rightrfloor = A cdot frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} = u_n. ] 4. **Consider Other Related Sequences**: Define sequences y_n and z_n for comparison, where: [ y_n = n quad text{and} quad z_n = leftlfloor frac{(n+2)^2}{4} rightrfloor. ] For y_n: [ leftlfloor frac{n+2}{n} y_{n-1} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor n-2+frac{4}{n} rightrfloor = n = y_n. ] For even n, let n = 2m: [ leftlfloor frac{n+2}{n} z_{n-1} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{m+1}{m} leftlfloor frac{(2m+1)^2}{4} rightrfloor rightrfloor = (m+1)^2 = z_n. ] For odd n, let n = 2m+1: [ leftlfloor frac{2m+3}{2m+1} leftlfloor frac{(2m+2)^2}{4} rightrfloor rightrfloor = leftlfloor (m+1)(m+2) + frac{m+1}{2m+1} rightrfloor = (m+1)(m+2) = z_n. ] 5. **Determine General Solutions**: According to the nonnegative integer A, we introduce the sequences: [ v_n = u_n + y_n = A cdot frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} + n ] And: [ w_n = u_n + z_n = A cdot frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} + leftlfloor frac{(n+2)^2}{4} rightrfloor ] 6. **Analyze Initial Conditions and Modulo Cases**: - For u_1 = 3A, y_1 = 1, z_1 = leftlfloor frac{9}{4} rightrfloor = 2: Therefore, consider cases based on ( c (text{mod } 3) ): - If ( 3 mid c-1 ), then: [ x_n = u_n = A cdot frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} + 1 ] Hence: [ x_n = frac{c-1}{6}(n+1)(n+2) + 1. ] - If ( c equiv 1 (text{mod } 3) ): [ x_n = v_n = frac{c-1}{6}(n+1)(n+2) + n + 1. ] - If ( c equiv 2 (text{mod } 3) ): [ x_n = w_n = frac{c-3}{6}(n+1)(n+2) + leftlfloor frac{(n+2)^2}{4} rightrfloor + 1. ] # Conclusion: Combining the above results, the general formula for the sequence {x_n} is: [ boxed{ begin{aligned} &text{If} c equiv 1 (text{mod } 3), && x_n = frac{c-1}{6}(n+1)(n+2) + 1; &text{If} c equiv 2 (text{mod } 3), && x_n = frac{c-2}{6}(n+1)(n+2) + n + 1; &text{If} c equiv 0 (text{mod } 3), && x_n = frac{c-3}{6}(n+1)(n+2) + leftlfloor frac{(n+2)^2}{4} rightrfloor + 1. end{aligned} } ]"},{"prompt":"Given two circles C_{1}: x^{2}+y^{2}=4 and C_{2}: (x1)^{2}+(y3)^{2}=4, a moving point P(a, b) forms tangents PM and PN with circles C_{1} and C_{2} respectively, where M and N are the points of tangency.

We need to determine the maximum number of squares that can be colored black such that no two adjacent squares (sharing an edge) are both black. 2. **Divide the Faces into Strips**: We will first construct a method to satisfy the given coloring condition. To achieve this, we consider the entire cube and break it down into individual faces. Each face is divided into concentric strips around the vertices. 3. **Counting Squares per Strip**: - For a given (k^{th}) strip on a face, we will count the number of unit squares it contains. - For strip (k), it contains (S_k = 6k - 3) unit squares. 4. **Maximize Black Squares per Strip**: - Since no adjacent squares can both be black, the maximum number of black squares in strip (k) is given by: [ leftlfloor frac{S_k}{2} rightrfloor = 3k - 2 ] 5. **Summing Up for the Entire Cube**: - Consider there are (500) such strips around each vertex, given the symmetry of the cube. - We calculate the total number of black squares over all (4000) strips (since there are (6) faces and each has (500) strips). 6. **Total Squares in the Cube**: - The cube has a total of (6 times 1000^2 = 6,000,000) unit squares. 7. **Calculate the Maximum Possible Black Squares**: - Since no two adjacent squares can be black, each strip contributes: [ leftlfloor frac{6 times 1000^2 - 4000}{2} rightrfloor = 3 times 1000^2 - 2000 = 2998000 ] 8. **Verification and Construction of Coloring Method**: - Suppose we construct a method satisfying the problem conditions, where the sides of the cube are alternately colored like a checkerboard. - On the top and bottom faces, apart from the edges which are colored white, the rest are colored in a checkerboard pattern.

These cevians are concurrent at the point P. 2. **Construct the feet of the altitudes:** Let H_A, H_B, and H_C be the feet of the altitudes from A, B, and C, respectively, dropping perpendicularly onto the opposite sides in triangle ABC. 3. **Symmetric cevians:** We construct the symmetric counterparts of these cevians with respect to the altitudes: - Let D' be the reflection of D across H_A, thus D' in BC. - Similarly, define E' and F' as the reflections of E and F across H_B and H_C, respectively. 4. **Remark on position of symmetric cevians:** We first show that the segments [AD'], [BE'], [CF'] are not external to triangle ABC. If, for example, AD' was outside triangle ABC, then one of the segments [AB] or [AC] would be contained within the triangle ADD'. Given AD = AD' = lambda < min{AB, AC}, this is contradictory.

To do this, we need to express the selling price S in terms of the cost price C. From the equation above, we can solve for S: S = (50C) / 28 Now, let's find the gain or loss per article. If the selling price S is greater than the cost price C, there is a gain. If the selling price S is less than the cost price C, there is a loss.

Therefore, [ HA' = 2R cos A cdot sin(B - C) ] Similarly, for HB' and HC': [ HB' = 2R cos B cdot sin(C - A) ] [ HC' = 2R cos C cdot sin(A - B) ] 4. **Summing the Distances:** We sum the expressions for HA', HB', and HC': [ HA' + HB' + HC' = 2R cos A cdot sin(B - C) + 2R cos B cdot sin(C - A) + 2R cos C cdot sin(A - B) ] 5. **Simplifying the Sum:** Using the trigonometric identity sin(x - y) = sin x cos y - cos x sin y, we can rewrite the sum: [ HA' + HB' + HC' = 2R (cos A sin(B - C) + cos B sin(C - A) + cos C sin(A - B)) ] By the properties of the angles in a triangle and the fact that triangle ABC is acute-angled, we know that the sum of these terms is less than 2R. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we have: [ HA' + HB' + HC' < 2R ] The final answer is boxed{HA' + HB' + HC' < 2R}"},{"prompt":"Given that Phi and varphi are the two distinct solutions to the equation x^2 = x + 2, find the value of (Phivarphi)^2.","completion":"Firstly, rewrite the equation in the standard form of a quadratic equation: x^2 - x - 2 = 0.

Therefore, option B is boxed{text{correct}}. - Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,1), option C is incorrect. - The statement in option D about the minimum value being greater than the maximum value cannot be directly concluded from the given analysis but checking the values at critical points and endpoints (if applicable) would be necessary. However, as the solution provided claims option D is correct, it seems there might be a misunderstanding, as we have not directly verified the maximum value of f(x) to conclude option D is correct. The correct interpretation would be that we have identified fleft(frac{3}{2}right) as a local minimum, not directly comparing the minimum and maximum values of f(x) across its entire domain. Hence, the correct option is: boxed{B}. However, the claim that option D is correct appears to be a misinterpretation based on the provided analysis."},{"prompt":"A bear carried buns from the market.

(2) Proof: From (1), we know that when k < 0, at x = frac{-1}{2k}, the original function has a maximum value, which is also the largest value. To prove f(x) leqslant frac{3}{4k} - 2, it suffices to prove: f(frac{-1}{2k}) leqslant frac{3}{4k} - 2, Taking the difference: f(frac{-1}{2k}) - (frac{3}{4k} - 2) = ln(frac{-1}{2k}) + frac{1}{2}(frac{-1}{2k}) - 1 - frac{3}{2}(frac{-1}{2k}) + 2, Let: t = frac{-1}{2k} > 0, then: Let: phi(t) = f(frac{-1}{2k}) - (frac{3}{4k} - 2) = ln t - t + 1, phi'(t) = frac{1}{t} - 1 Let: phi'(t) = 0, solving gives: t = 1, and when t > 1, phi'(t) < 0, the original function is decreasing, when t < 1, phi'(t) > 0, the original function is increasing, thus: phi(1) = ln 1 - 1 + 1 = 0 is the maximum value of the function, Therefore, f(frac{-1}{2k}) - (frac{3}{4k} - 2) leqslant phi(1) = 0, that is f(frac{-1}{2k}) leqslant (frac{3}{4k} - 2). Hence, f(x) leqslant - frac{3}{4k} - 2, and the original inequality is proven. boxed{f(x) leqslant - frac{3}{4k} - 2}"},{"prompt":"Given the ellipse (frac{x^{2}}{4}+y^{2}=1) with left and right foci (F_{1}) and (F_{2}) respectively, let (M) be a point on the ellipse, and let (I) be the incenter of (triangle M F_{1} F_{2}).

The left and right foci of the ellipse, denoted (F_{1}) and (F_{2}), are derived as follows: - The standard form of the ellipse equation (frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1) where (a) is the semi-major axis and (b) is the semi-minor axis. Here, (a^2 = 4) and (b^2 = 1), so (a = 2) and (b = 1). - The distance of the foci from the center (denoted as (c)) is given by (c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{4 - 1} = sqrt{3}). - Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are ((-sqrt{3}, 0)) and ((sqrt{3}, 0)). 3. Let (M) be a point on the ellipse. Let (I) be the incenter of (triangle M F_{1} F_{2}). 4.

The relationships are: - (F_{1}D = F_{1}H), (HF_{2} = F_{2}E), and - (|MD| = |ME|). - Thus, the equality of segments implies [ |MD| = frac{1}{2} left( |MF_{1}| + |MF_{2}| - |F_{1}F_{2}| right). ] - Substituting the lengths from the coordinates, [ |F_{1}F_{2}| = 2 sqrt{3}. ] - Hence for any point (M) on the ellipse distinct intersection characteristics unfold as: [ |MD| = |MI| cos frac{angle F_{1} M F_{2}}{2}, quad |MF_{1}| + |MF_{2}| - |F_{1}F_{2}| = 2 |MI| cos frac{angle F_{1} M F_{2}}{2}, ] [ Rightarrow |MI| cos frac{angle F_{1} M F_{2}}{2} = frac{1}{2} left( |MF_{1}| + |MF_{2}| - 2sqrt{3} right). ] 6.

Express the sum of the arithmetic series ( (n+1), (n+2), ldots, (n+k) ). The formula for the sum of these ( k ) consecutive integers is: S = frac{k}{2} left( 2n + k + 1 right) 4. Setting this equal to 3^{11}, we have: 3^{11} = frac{k(k+1)}{2} + nk 5. To solve for ( k ), let's simplify this equation. First, multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction property: 2 cdot 3^{11} = k(k+1) + 2nk Rewriting the equation, we get: 2 cdot 3^{11} = k(2n + k + 1) 6. We need to maximize ( k ).

Substitute ( k = 486 ) into the simplified equation: 2 cdot 3^{11} = 486(2n + 486 + 1) 354294 = 486(2n + 487) Divide both sides by 486: 2n + 487 = frac{354294}{486} Compute the division: 2n + 487 = 729 10.

If ( p = 2 ) and ( q = 3 ), the equation has a known solution: [ 2^4 + 3^2 = 16 + 9 = 25 = 5^2. ] 2. **Case ( p = q )**: Assume ( p = q ). For simplicity, let's assume ( x leq y ) (a similar argument would hold if ( y < x )). Then we have: [ p^{2x}(p^{2(y-x)} + 1) = z^2. ] This implies that ( z^2 ) is divisible by ( p^{2x} ). Hence, we can write ( z = p^x w ). Dividing both sides of the equation by ( p^{2x} ), we get: [ p^{2(y-x)} + 1 = w^2. ] Further, this implies: [ p^{2(y-x)} = w^2 - 1 = (w - 1)(w + 1). ] Since ( (w - 1) ) and ( (w + 1) ) are two consecutive integers, both must be powers of ( p ). Therefore, let: [ w - 1 = p^alpha quad text{and} quad w + 1 = p^beta, ] for some non-negative integers ( alpha < beta ). Then: [ p^beta - p^alpha = 2. ] Since ( alpha + beta = 2(y - x) ), both ( alpha ) and ( beta ) must be of the same parity. However, for any ( p geq 2 ), ( p^beta geq 4 p^alpha > p^alpha + 2 ), which contradicts ( p^beta = p^alpha + 2 ). Hence, there are no solutions for ( p = q ). 3. **Case ( p < q )**: Notice that ( q ) must be odd: [ q^{2y} = z^2 - p^{2x} = (z - p^x)(z + p^x). ] Both ( z - p^x ) and ( z + p^x ) must then be powers of ( q ), so let: [ z - p^x = q^a quad text{and} quad z + p^x = q^b, ] for some non-negative integers ( a < b ).

We need a large number of points on this circle. Using parametrization, for a given ( t ), the points on the unit circle can be written as: [ left( frac{t^2 - 1}{t^2 + 1}, frac{2t}{t^2 + 1} right) ] where ( t ) is a parameter. This rational parametrization of the unit circle shows a way to generate various points on the circle. 2. **Generate a Sufficiently Large Set:** We consider the integers ( t = 1, 2, ldots, 1993 ). For each ( t ): [ left( frac{(t^2 - 1)}{(t^2 + 1)}, frac{2t}{(t^2 + 1)} right) ] which generates 1993 distinct points in each quadrant of the unit circle. 3. **Combining Points for Larger Sets:** For each ( t ), we square its value: [ n = prod_{t=1}^{1993} (1 + t^2) ] All these points can be scaled to the unit length by considering the set of all points ((a/n, b/n)), where ( a ) and ( b ) are integer coordinates which appropriately occupy the set lattice points ( |m| leq n ). 4. **Array of Rational Points:** By constructing the array of rational points with coordinates ( (a/n, b/n) ) where ( 0 leq a,b leq 2n ), we ensure that these points maintain rational distances between each other. 5. **Ensuring Quadrants Each Cover the Set:** The unit circle centered at any point in this array must intersect other points in such a manner that any quadrant of the circle covers other points. This coverage ensures that there are at least 1993 points in the set within any quadrant chosen. 6. **Conclusion:** The essential idea uses the fact that parametrized lattice points on the unit circle when considered in a sufficiently large rational array give us the required coverage property.

Therefore, the integral is maximized when we choose a = -20 and b = 19 because: - On the interval (-20, 19), f(x) > 0. - Outside this interval, f(x) < 0. 4. **Use Cumulative Integral Function:** Define the cumulative integral function F(x) as: F(x) = int_{0}^{x} e^{cos t} left(380 - t - t^2 right) , dt. We analyze F(x) to get insights into the integral's maximization: - We aim to show that the integral on (-20, 19) is greater than any other interval.

Adding these together gives us the total number of yellow and red candles: [27 + 14 = 41] This means Caleb used 41 candles that were either yellow or red. Since we know Caleb put one candle for each year of his grandfather's age, and his grandfather is turning 79 years old, the total number of candles used is 79. To find out how many of those were blue, we subtract the number of yellow and red candles from the total number of candles: [79 - 41 = 38] Therefore, Caleb used boxed{38} blue candles for his grandfather's birthday cake."},{"prompt":"Calculate the product of 1010_2 and 102_3 in base 10.","completion":"First, convert 1010_2 from binary to decimal: [ 1010_2 = 1 times 2^3 + 0 times 2^2 + 1 times 2^1 + 0 times 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10 ] Next, convert 102_3 from ternary to decimal: [ 102_3 = 1 times 3^2 + 0 times 3^1 + 2 times 3^0 = 9 + 0 + 2 = 11 ] Now, multiply the converted values: [ 10 times 11 = 110 ] Thus, the product of 1010_2 and 102_3 in base 10 is boxed{110}."},{"prompt":"Given a triangle (ABC) and points (P) and (Q) located on its circumcircle.

Prove that points (A'), (B'), and (C') lie on a single line.","completion":"To prove that the points ( A' ), ( B' ), and ( C' ) lie on a straight line, we will utilize symmetry and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Here's the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Define Projections and Reflections:** Let ( P_{text{a}}', P_{text{b}}', P_{text{c}}' ) be the projections of point ( P ) onto the sides of the triangle ( ABC ). 2. **Prove that Projections Lie on a Line:** We need to show that ( P_{text{a}}, P_{text{b}}, P_{text{c}} ) lie on one straight line. - Consider the angle relationships in the problem. [ angle P P'_{text{c}} P'_{text{a}} = angle PB P' = angle PAC = 180^circ - angle P P'_{text{c}} P'_{text{b}} ] 3. **Use Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties:** The key insight is recognizing that quadrilaterals ( PP'_{text{a}}BP'_{text{c}} ) and ( PP'_{text{c}}P_{text{b}}A ) are cyclic quadrilaterals. This follows from the fact that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral add up to ( 180^circ ). 4. **Simson Line:** The straight line formed by points ( P'_{text{a}} ), ( P'_{text{b}} ), and ( P'_{text{c}} ) is known as the Simson line of point ( P ) with respect to triangle ( ABC ). Hence, these points lie on a single line. 5. **Parallelism and Collinearity:** Consider the analogous setup for point ( Q ). Let ( l_{text{q}} ) be the line containing the projections of ( Q ), ( Q_{text{a}}, Q_{text{b}}, Q_{text{c}} ). 6. **Intersection Points:** Let's define the points ( A' ), ( B' ), and ( C' ) as the intersections of the lines ( PQ_{text{a}} ) and ( QP_{text{a}} ), ( PQ_{text{b}} ) and ( QP_{text{b}} ), ( PQ_{text{c}} ) and ( QP_{text{c}} ), respectively. 7. **Construct Line l:** Consider a line parallel to ( l_{text{q}} ) passing through ( P ). Let this line intersect ( l_{text{p}} ) at point ( X ). Similarly, let a line parallel to ( l_{text{p}} ) through ( Q ) intersect ( l_{text{q}} ) at point ( Y ). 8. **Show Homothety:** By properties of parallel lines dealing with homothety, triangles ( PX'P_{text{a}} ) and ( Q_{text{a}}YQ ) are homothetic. This means that the lines ( PQ_{text{a}}, P_{text{a}}Q ), and ( XY ) must all pass through the homothety center ( A' ). 9. **Conclusion:** Therefore, point ( A' ) lies on line ( XY ). Similarly, points ( B' ) and ( C' ) must also lie on this line, established through analogous arguments. Hence, the points ( A' ), ( B' ), and ( C' ) are collinear, proving they lie on a single straight line.

The sum of the first n even integers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) For even integers, the first term is 2, and the nth term would be 2n. So we can rewrite the formula as: Sum = n/2 * (2 + 2n) We know the sum is 4,970, so we can set up the equation: 4,970 = n/2 * (2 + 2n) Now, let's solve for n: 4,970 = n * (1 + n) 4,970 = n + n^2 This is a quadratic equation in the form of n^2 + n - 4,970 = 0. To solve for n, we can use the quadratic formula: n = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a) In this equation, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -4,970. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula gives us: n = [-1 ± sqrt(1^2 - 4(1)(-4,970))] / (2(1)) n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 19,880)] / 2 n = [-1 ± sqrt(19,881)] / 2 n = [-1 ± 141] / 2 We have two potential solutions for n: (-1 + 141) / 2 and (-1 - 141) / 2. Since n must be positive (as we're talking about a positive number of integers), we discard the negative solution and take the positive one: n = (140) / 2 n = 70 So, there are 70 even integers that sum up to 4,970. Now, let's find the sum of the first 70 odd integers. The sum of the first n odd integers is given by the formula: Sum of odd integers = n^2 Since we have 70 odd integers, the sum will be: Sum = 70^2 Sum = 4,900 Therefore, the sum of the first 70 odd integers is boxed{4,900} ."},{"prompt":"Consider all acuteangled triangles with a given side a and angle alpha.

Next, we need to maximize the expression b^2 + c^2. Note that for acute-angled triangles, the angle alpha satisfies 0 < alpha < frac{pi}{2}, hence cos alpha > 0. 3. Recognize the inequality involving 2bc. Specifically: [ 2bc leq b^2 + c^2 ] This follows directly from the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality: [ frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} geq sqrt{b^2c^2} = bc ] Simplifying, we get: [ b^2 + c^2 geq 2bc ] 4.

The sum of the digits of ( 2x ) can be expressed as: [ S(2x) = sum_{k=1}^9 2k n_k(x) - 9 sum_{k=5}^9 n_k(x) ] This accounts for the fact that digits ( 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ) in ( x ) will cause a carry when doubled. 6.

This means that every boy ( b_i ) won their match against every girl ( g_j ). Therefore, every boy's losses were only against other boys. 3. **Analyze the boys' losses:** Since every boy lost at least one match, the number of losses for each boy must be between ( 1 ) and ( m-1 ) (inclusive). This is because no boy can win all matches (which would imply zero losses) and no boy can lose all matches (which would imply ( m ) losses, but there are only ( m-1 ) other boys to lose to). 4. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle:** The Pigeonhole Principle states that if ( n ) items are put into ( m ) containers, with ( n > m ), then at least one container must contain more than one item.

Since the logarithmic function (log(2a^2 - a)) must be defined and real, we need (2a^2 - a > 0). 3. Because the equation has one positive root and one negative root, the sum of the roots and the product of the roots will give us vital conditions.

Specifically, the sides of all these rectangles must be parallel to each other. 3. **Selection of a side:** Select any side l of the polygon P. For ease of understanding, let's say l is horizontal. 4. **Alignment of adjacent rectangles:** Observe that any rectangle P_i that shares a side with l must have one of its sides parallel to l (horizontal). This is because the rectangles are non-overlapping and must cover P without gaps. 5. **Propagation of alignment:** Next, any rectangle P_j that shares a side with P_i must also have one side parallel to l. This follows from the fact that each adjacent rectangle must match up exactly with the previous one in the arrangement covering P. 6. **General case for all rectangles:** By this method, continuing from one rectangle to its neighbors, we can see that all rectangles P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n must have their sides parallel to l or perpendicular to l. This ensures that the entire structure of rectangles maintains this alignment throughout. 7. **Implication for polygon P:** From the arrangement of rectangles covering polygon P, it follows that sides of P must also be parallel or perpendicular to l. 8. **Convexity constraint:** Since P is a convex polygon, it cannot have more than one pair of sides that are parallel due to the fundamental definition of convex polygons. Specifically, in a convex polygon, all internal angles must be less than 180^circ, and the polygon must lie on one side of any line drawn along any of its sides. 9. **Conclusion:** Given that all sides of polygon P are either parallel or perpendicular to l and considering the properties of a convex polygon, P must be a rectangle. This is because a polygon with these properties and angle constraints can only have four sides, forming right angles, thus making it a rectangle. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A regular decagon is inscribed in a square so that each square side is quartered by the vertices of the decagon.

If one base angle and the vertex angle sum up to 100^{circ}, then the other base angle must be 180^{circ} - 100^{circ} = 80^{circ}. - Since the triangle is isosceles, the two base angles are equal, leading to a contradiction in this case as we initially assumed the sum of the vertex angle and one base angle is 100^{circ}.

The real semi-axis of the hyperbola (frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1) is (a), and the semi-focal distance is (c), with the other focus being (F'). Since the focus (F) of the parabola coincides with the right focus of the hyperbola, we have (c = frac{p}{2}), and thus the focal distance of the hyperbola (|FF'| = 2c = p). Since (triangle PFF') is a right-angled triangle, we have (|PF'| = sqrt{|FF'|^{2} + |PF|^{2}} = sqrt{2}p). According to the definition of the hyperbola, we get (2a = |PF'| - |PF| = sqrt{2}p - p), thus (a = (sqrt{2} - 1)p). Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola is (e = frac{c}{a} = frac{frac{1}{2}p}{frac{(sqrt{2} - 1)p}{2}} = sqrt{2} + 1). Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{A}.

First, we rewrite the equation of l_{2} in a more revealing form: y = kx - k + 1 = k(x - 1) + 1. This shows that line l_{2} passes through the point (1, 1). Since the equation of line l_{1} is y = x, it is clear that line l_{1} also passes through the point (1, 1). Therefore, the intersection point A of lines l_{1} and l_{2} is (1, 1).

We can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which, in this case, is the cross-section of the river) to find the width of the river: Volume = Width x Depth x Flow rate per minute We know the volume (2750 cubic meters), the depth (3 meters), and the flow rate per minute (16.67 meters per minute), so we can solve for the width: 2750 cubic meters = Width x 3 meters x 16.67 meters per minute Now, we solve for the width: Width = 2750 cubic meters / (3 meters x 16.67 meters per minute) Width = 2750 / 50.01 Width ≈ 54.99 meters So, the river is approximately boxed{55} meters wide."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=ax^{2}+2axln (x+1), where ainmathbb{R}.

We'll start by considering the difference between the two sides of the inequality. The denominator is positive, so it suffices to examine the numerator. 1. **Formulate the Numerators:** The numerator of the left-hand side is a geometric series summed up to ( a^n ): S_1 = 1 + a + a^2 + ldots + a^n The numerator of the right-hand side multiplied by the denominator of the left-hand side is: S_2 = (n+1) (a + a^2 + ldots + a^{n-1}) Let's consider the difference: (n-1)S_1 - (n+1)S_2 2. **Simplify Using Series Formulas:** Let: T = a + a^2 + ldots + a^{n-1} Therefore, S_1 = 1 + T + a^n Using the representation for ( S_2 ): S_2 = (n+1)T Our task is to prove: (n-1)(1 + T + a^n) - (n+1)T geq 0 3. **Expand and Combine Like Terms:** Expand the equation: (n-1)(1 + T + a^n) - (n+1)T = (n-1) + (n-1)T + (n-1)a^n - (n+1)T Combining like terms: = (n-1) + (n-1)a^n - 2T Thus, = (n-1) + (n-1)a^n - 2(a + a^2 + ldots + a^{n-1}) 4. **Further Break Down the Series:** Notice that ( T ) can similarly be broken down as: T = a + a^2 + ldots + a^{n-1} Therefore, = (n-1) + (n-1)a^n - 2(a + a^2 + ldots + a^{n-1}) 5. **Evaluate Each Term:** The terms (a, a^2, ldots, a^{n-1}) can be rearranged to see that each term being subtracted is multiplied by 2, which should ensure non-negativity since each power of (a), e.g., (a^k (1 - a^{n-k-1})) where ( k ) varies from 0 to ( n-1 ), will give non-negative result for ( a > 0 ). 6. **Examine Edge Cases and Indeterminate Situations:** For (a = 1): S_1 = n+1 quad text{and} quad S_2 = (n+1) Thus ( (n-1) (n+1) - (n+1)n ) evaluates to zero showing equality holds for (a=1). 7. **Conclusion:** Since every term in the series is non-negative for ( a > 0 ): The inequality holds for (a > 0) and ( n > 1 ).

This implies that the product is divisible by ( 10^8 = 2^8 cdot 5^8 ). Since the sum of those three numbers, 1003, is not divisible by 5, at least one of these numbers must not be divisible by 5. Let's label the three numbers as ( a, b, ), and ( c ) such that ( a + b + c = 1003 ). For their product to be divisible by ( 5^8 ), at least one of these numbers should contribute ( 5^8 ) or the product of some other two should meet this requirement. 6. **Analyze the conditions:** - If a number is divisible by ( 5^5 ), it becomes ( geq 3125 > 1003 ).

If A and B are adjacent vertices of the polygon, and O is the center of the circle, find an expression for the value of ∠OAB in terms of the number of sides.","completion":"A regular 20-sided polygon is also known as an icosagon. When a regular polygon is inscribed in a circle, each vertex of the polygon lies on the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle (point O) is equidistant from all the vertices of the polygon. Since the polygon is regular, all its sides and angles are equal. The total angle around point O (the center of the circle) is 360 degrees. This total angle is divided equally among all the central angles formed by connecting the center of the circle to each pair of adjacent vertices. For a regular n-sided polygon, each central angle (angle formed by two radii and two adjacent vertices) would be 360/n degrees. In the case of a 20-sided polygon, each central angle would be 360/20 degrees. However, ∠OAB is not the central angle but an angle at the vertex of the polygon. To find ∠OAB, we need to consider the isosceles triangle formed by the radii OA and OB and the side AB of the polygon. Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, they are equal in length, and thus triangle OAB is isosceles. The central angle O corresponding to the side AB of the polygon is bisected by the line segment AB, creating two equal angles at A and B. Since the central angle is 360/20 degrees, each of these angles at A and B (which are ∠OAB and ∠OBA) would be half of that. So, ∠OAB = (360/20) / 2 = 360/(2*20) = 360/40 = 9 degrees.

Due to the odd function property, f(-x) = -f(x), this increasing behavior reflects symmetrically about the origin. Therefore, in the interval left(-b,-aright), f(x) will also be increasing. This is because if f(x) increases as x increases in left(a,bright), then f(x) decreases as x decreases in left(-b,-aright), which, due to the odd function property, translates to an increase in f(x) as x increases in left(-b,-aright). Therefore, Option A is correct. **Option B: g(x) is increasing on the interval left(-b,-aright)** For an even function, such as g(x), if it is increasing in the interval left(a,bright), this does not necessarily imply it is increasing in left(-b,-aright). Because g(x) is even, g(-x) = g(x), meaning the function mirrors itself across the y-axis. If g(x) is increasing in left(a,bright), then in left(-b,-aright), g(x) will actually be decreasing, since g(-x) = g(x) and for x_1 < x_2 in left(-b,-aright), we would have g(x_1) = g(-x_1) > g(-x_2) = g(x_2). Hence, Option B is incorrect. **Option C: frac{f(x)}{g(x)} is odd and increasing on left(a,bright)** Taking the specific example of f(x) = x (odd) and g(x) = x^2 (even), where both functions are increasing on left(1,2right), we can test the behavior of frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = frac{x}{x^2} = frac{1}{x}, which is an odd function. However, frac{1}{x} is decreasing on left(1,2right) since as x increases, frac{1}{x} decreases. Therefore, Option C is incorrect. **Option D: f(x)+g(x) does not have odd or even symmetry, and the monotonicity on left(a,bright) is uncertain** Considering the function F(x) = f(x) - g(x), and analyzing its symmetry, F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = -f(x) - g(x) because f(x) is odd and g(x) is even. This shows that F(x) does not exhibit odd or even symmetry. Since f(x) is increasing on left(a,bright) and g(x) is also increasing on left(a,bright), it makes the monotonicity of F(x) = f(x) - g(x) uncertain on left(a,bright). Therefore, Option D is correct.

By definition, D lies on circle k since it maintains the property of being equidistant from the line ( BC ), thus creating a symmetric configuration. 2. **Intersection at ( K' ):** Let ( K' ) be the intersection point of line ( BD ) and line ( MO ), where ( M ) is any chosen point on ( BC ). Our goal is to show that ( K' = K ), where ( K ) is a point on circle ( k ) such that ( MO ) intersects ( k ) again at ( K ). 3. **Angle Equality:** To show that ( angle AMO = angle BDA ), we analyze the circumcircle (triangle ABM). Let ( L ) be the point diametrically opposite ( M ) in this circle. Here ( angle LAM ) is right, so: [ angle AMO = 90^circ - angle ALM ] Because ( AD perp BM ), we have: [ angle BDA = angle BAD = 90^circ - angle ABM ] Since ( angle ABM ) and ( angle ALM ) subtend the same arc in the circumcircle of (triangle ABM), we get: [ angle ABM = angle ALM ] Thus, proving: [ angle BDA = angle AMO ] 4. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** We now aim to show A, D, M, and K' are concyclic. According to the theorem on cyclic quadrilaterals, this can be proven if either of the following conditions holds: - (angle AMK' + angle ADK' = 180^circ) - (angle AMG = angle AHF) for points ( E, F, G, H ) to be concyclic. We consider the possible positions of M relative to AD. **Case a.** (M) lies to the right of (AD), (O) and (K') are on the same side of (M): - i. If B and (K') are on the same side of D, then: [ angle AMK' = angle AMO = angle ADB = angle ADK' ] Hence, quadrilateral AMDK' is cyclic by condition 2. - ii. If B and (K') are on opposite sides of D, then: [ angle AMK' = angle AMO = angle ADB = 180^circ - angle ADK' ] So angle AMK' + angle ADK' = 180^circ, making quadrilateral AMK'D cyclic by condition 1. **Case b.** (M) lies to the left of (AD), (O) and (K') are on opposite sides of (M): - i. If B and (K') are on the same side of D, then: [ angle ADK' = angle ADB = angle AMO = 180^circ - angle AMK' ] Thus, angle ADK' + angle AMK' = 180^circ, making quadrilateral ADK'M cyclic by condition 1. - ii. If B and (K') are on opposite sides of D, then: [ angle ADK' = 180^circ - angle ADB = 180^circ - angle AMO = angle AMK' ] Therefore, quadrilateral AK'DM is cyclic by condition 2. 5. **Conclusion:** This confirms that points A, D, M, and (K') are concyclic. Since k is the unique circle passing through A, D, and M, it follows that (K' ) must lie on k, hence (K' = K). Consequently, (BK) is the same line, independent of the position of M on segment BC.

Notably, all four corner cells of our grid are \\"fields\\". 3. **Movement of the Hole:** The hole initially placed in one of the corners is the starting point. When a domino piece adjacent to the hole moves to cover it, it exposes a new hole in a new position. 4. **Arrow Assignment:** Assign an arrow from the center of each \\"field\\" (A) to the center of an adjacent \\"field\\" (B) if (A) and (B) are separated by a domino (assuming (A) is covered by a domino and (B) is the \\"field\\" exposed when this domino moves).

If a \\"field\\" (A) has an arrow pointing to another \\"field\\" (B), then the hole can move from (B) to (A) by sliding the domino along the direction of the arrow. 6. **Cycle Analysis:** Consider the possibility of cycles (sequences of \\"fields\\" where movement can return to the same point). Given our domino arrangement and the properties of the grid (odd dimensions), any cycle formed will enclose a region with an odd number of cells—impossible in our configuration since each domino covers two cells, implying an even number of cells must be enclosed. 7. **Conclusion - Absence of Cycles:** Since cycles in the paths are impossible (they contradict the even covering requirement and odd grid dimension), there will always be a path from any given \\"field\\" to the current position of the hole. This forms an acyclic connected structure allowing continuous movement of the hole through all odd-indexed cells. 8. **Final Proof:** The non-existence of cycles guarantees that there is always a sequence of moves (defined through \\"fields\\" and arrows) to transfer the hole from its initial position to any other corner. As moving the hole involves sliding dominoes that respect the grid's odd structure, it reassures us that covering/uncovering operations maintain logical consistency. Given these steps and logical coherence, the problem is thus proven. The hole can indeed be moved to any corner of the box by following the paths predefined by the arrows and corresponding movements.

This gives us: [ frac{|k cdot 0 - 1 cdot (-1) + 3 - 2k|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 2 ] Solving this equation for k yields: [ k = frac{3}{4} ] Thus, the equation of line l in this case is: [ 3x - 4y + 6 = 0 ] *Case 2:* The slope of line l does not exist, which means line l is vertical.

However, since y - x must be greater than 5, we need to find the next odd number that is at least 6 greater than x. Let's start with the smallest even integer, which is 0. The next odd integer would be 1, but we need a difference greater than 5. So we add 6 to 0 to get the next possible value for y, which is 6. However, 6 is not odd, so we need to add 1 to get the next odd integer, which is 7. So the smallest value for y that satisfies y - x > 5 is 7 when x is 0.

These are the numbers that can be written in the form a^2 bmod p for some integer a. 2. **Properties of Quadratic Residues modulo p:** Since p is an odd prime, the quadratic residues modulo p belong to specific residue classes. It is known that the quadratic residues modulo p include 0 and exactly half of the non-zero residues. Therefore, the number of distinct quadratic residues modulo p is: [ 1 + frac{p - 1}{2} = frac{p + 1}{2}. ] This count includes the residue 0 and the rest being distinct residues modulo p. 3. **Distribution of Quadratic Residues:** We distribute frac{p^2 + 1}{2} quadratic residues into frac{p + 1}{2} residue classes modulo p. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle (Schubfachprinzip): [ leftlceil frac{frac{p^2 + 1}{2}}{frac{p + 1}{2}} rightrceil ] ensures that at least one residue class contains: [ leftlceil frac{p^2 + 1}{p + 1} rightrceil ] numbers. 4. **Simplify the Expression:** Simplify the fraction: [ frac{p^2 + 1}{p + 1} = frac{p^2 + p + p - p + 1}{p + 1} = p + frac{p - 1}{p + 1}. ] Since 0 < frac{p - 1}{p + 1} < 1, we have: [ leftlceil p + frac{p - 1}{p + 1} rightrceil = p. ] 5. **Conclusion from the Pigeonhole Principle:** At least one residue class has at least p quadratic residues. Select these p quadratic residues. Clearly, all these residues are congruent to the same value modulo p, making their sum divisible by p: [ sum_{i=1}^p a_i equiv 0 pmod{p}. ] 6. **Arithmetic Mean is an Integer:** Since the sum of the selected p numbers is divisible by p, the arithmetic mean: [ frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_p}{p} ] is an integer. # Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to select p elements from the set M such that their arithmetic mean is an integer.

Since the paint costs 60 per kilogram, we can divide the total cost by the cost per kilogram to find the number of kilograms used: 1800 / 60/kg = 30 kg Now we know that 30 kilograms of paint were used. Next, we need to find out how much area can be covered by 30 kilograms of paint. Since 1 kilogram of paint covers 20 square feet, 30 kilograms will cover: 30 kg * 20 sq ft/kg = 600 sq ft So, the total surface area of the cube that was painted is 600 square feet. A cube has 6 equal sides, so to find the area of one side, we divide the total surface area by 6: 600 sq ft / 6 = 100 sq ft per side The area of one side of the cube is 100 square feet. Since the area of a square (which is the shape of each side of the cube) is equal to the length of one side squared, we can find the length of one side by taking the square root of the area: √100 sq ft = 10 ft Therefore, the length of each side of the cube is boxed{10} feet."},{"prompt":"Solve the system of inequalities with respect to x: left{begin{array}{l}{frac{x1}{x+2}≤0}{{x}^{2}2x3＜0}end{array}right..","completion":"To solve the system of inequalities with respect to x, we have the given system: left{begin{array}{l}{frac{x-1}{x+2}≤0}{{x}^{2}-2x-3＜0}end{array}right. 1. **Solving the first inequality** frac{x-1}{x+2}≤0: - The critical points occur when the numerator x-1=0 or the denominator x+2=0. - Solving these gives x=1 and x=-2, respectively. - Testing intervals around these points, we find the solution for this inequality to be -2＜x≤1. 2. **Solving the second inequality** {x}^{2}-2x-3＜0: - This quadratic inequality can be factored to (x+1)(x-3)<0. - The critical points here are x=-1 and x=3. - By testing values between these points, we determine the solution to this inequality is -1＜x＜3.

The Power of a Point theorem tells us that (MP cdot MQ = MB cdot MD). We now compute (MB cdot MD): 1. Since (AB = BC) and (AD = CD), triangles (ABD) and (CBD) are constructed with equal segments such that the diagonal segments (B rightarrow D) and the midpoint calculations around triangle (BDC). 2. Given that (MC = 6), and (MC) forms an altitude in the right triangle (BCD), we relate (MC) to the segments (MB) and (MD): [ MB cdot MD = MC^2 = 6^2 = 36. ] Conclusion: 1.

Let's denote the number of large rooms as L and the number of small rooms as S. Each large room can accommodate 3 people, and each small room can accommodate 2 people. We have a total of 26 people to accommodate. The total number of people accommodated can be represented by the equation: 3L + 2S = 26 We want to maximize L (the number of large rooms) while ensuring that S (the number of small rooms) is a non-negative integer because we can't have a fraction of a room. Let's start by seeing how many large rooms we can use: If we use 8 large rooms, we would accommodate 24 people (because 8 * 3 = 24), leaving 2 people to be accommodated in a small room. So, we would need 1 small room. This would give us: 3 * 8 + 2 * 1 = 24 + 2 = 26 So, we can accommodate all 26 people using 8 large rooms and 1 small room.

The problem gives us two scenarios: 1. If each person contributes 5 coins, they are short of 45 coins. 2. If each person contributes 7 coins, they are short of 3 coins. From these scenarios, we can set up equations based on the total amount of money needed to buy the sheep. In the first scenario, the total amount of money collected plus the shortfall equals the total cost of the sheep. In the second scenario, the same logic applies. This gives us two equations: 1. 5x + 45 equals the total cost of the sheep. 2. 7x + 3 also equals the total cost of the sheep. Since both expressions equal the total cost of the sheep, we can set them equal to each other to find the number of people in the group.

However, at ( x = 2 ), the function is not defined, meaning it cannot take the value it would have at ( x = 2 ), which is: [ f(2) = 2^2 + 4 times 2 - 21 = 4 + 8 - 21 = -9 ] Thus, the range of ( f(x) ) is all real numbers except (-9).

So, the coefficient for 4^3 is 2. Now, subtract 128 from 157 to get a remainder of 29. Then, the largest multiple of 16 that fits into 29 is 1 cdot 16 = 16, and the coefficient for 4^2 is 1. This leaves a remainder of 29 - 16 = 13. For 4^1 = 4, the largest multiple fitting into 13 is 3 cdot 4 = 12. The coefficient for 4^1 is 3. Finally, the remainder is 13 - 12 = 1. Since 4^0 = 1, the coefficient for 4^0 is 1. Combining these coefficients, we find 157_{10} = 2cdot4^3 + 1cdot4^2 + 3cdot4^1 + 1cdot4^0 = 2131_4.

This implies that g(x+1) = e^{x+1} = e cdot e^x = e^x, which is consistent with the definition of an extended function. Therefore, g(x) can be considered a periodic function with a period of 1 within the context of the problem, and its range within the interval (0,1) is (1,e). For statement (1), we analyze the intersection points between y = kx + b and y = g(x) = e^x. Since g(x) is not truly periodic across all real numbers but is defined piecewise with the property of an extended function, and its range is (1,e), a line y = kx + b (with k neq 0) cannot intersect g(x) infinitely many times because the slope k and the range of g(x) limit the number of possible intersections. Therefore, statement (1) is incorrect. **For h(x) = x^{10} when x in (0,1):** Given that h(x+1) = h'(x), we find h'(x) = 10x^9. However, the key insight here is not the derivative itself but the fact that for a specific value of k, specifically k = 10!, there can be a unique scenario where y = kx + b overlaps with y = x^{10} over an interval, leading to infinitely many intersection points due to the extension property of h(x). For statement (2), when k = 10!, we can adjust b such that y = 10!x + b aligns with y = x^{10} over a certain interval, like (9,10). This alignment, considering the extension property and the behavior of h(x), results in infinitely many intersection points between the line and the function within the extended definition.

We need to determine the minimal number of questions the traveler must ask to guarantee finding out who the liars are. Step-by-Step Solution 1. **Initial Question**: - The traveler begins by asking the question from any arbitrary point. - If all answers are the same, then it indicates that everyone at the table is likely a liar. This is because knights and liars would give different responses to the same question. 2. **Responses Analysis**: - More likely, the answers will vary since there are both liars and knights. - In this case, neighboring individuals will have given differing responses. We then investigate the interval (arc) between those who gave different responses. 3. **Intermediate Placement**: - The traveler then stands in the middle of this arc (which is between one knave and one knight). - He repeats the question at this new position. 4. **Response Consistency**: - Since at least one of the individuals is a liar, the distance to the nearest liar from either position is known. - Knights will truthfully provide this distance, while liars will give incorrect distances. 5. **Identification of Liars and Knights**: - Based on the mentioned distances, those revealing the correct distance are knights. - All remaining ones who provide incorrect information are liars.

Since Cody paid 17 and he split the cost equally with his friend, the total final price paid by both would be 17 * 2 = 34. Now, we know that after the taxes were applied, Cody got an 8 discount.

Connect two points with a line if and only if the corresponding people know each other. This gives us a graph with 17 vertices and 34 edges since each person knows exactly 4 other people, leading to frac{17 cdot 4}{2} = 34 edges in total. 3. If the conclusion of the problem does not hold, for any vertex (X), it either: - Is connected by an edge to 4 other vertices (known people), and - Those 4 vertices ((A, B, C, D)) each must connect to 3 more vertices since (X) is already one of their 4 connections. This suggests that these vertices (A, B, C, D) connect with the rest of the graph behind the original connections of (X). 4. Hence, these 4 vertices each account for additional 12 connections, but we haven't connected any vertex more than once (i.e., beyond 4 connections for each of (A, B, C, D)). 5. Since we have 34 edges in total and we used ( 4 times 3 + 4 = 16 ) for the immediate 4 vertices discussing connections around vertex (X), this means we need to connect the rest freely. 6.

Consider a convex n-gon in which all diagonals are drawn, subdividing it into smaller polygons. 2. A side of any of the subdivided polygons lies on one of two types of lines: - A side of the original n-gon. - A diagonal of the original n-gon. 3. Any line that defines a side of the smaller polygons passes through two vertices of the original n-gon. 4. Each vertex of the original n-gon can be a part of at most two such lines: - Because each vertex can be a part of one of the original n-gon's sides. - And can be part of at most one of the diagonals forming the subdivided polygons. 5. Hence, the maximum number of sides of any polygon within the subdivided polygonal arrangement will not exceed the number of vertices of the original n-gon. Therefore, each smaller polygon has at most n sides. boxed{text{Each smaller polygon has at most } n text{ sides.}} Part (b): 1. From part (a), we know that any smaller polygon has at most n sides. 2. If n is even, let's analyze further: - Consider the configuration where the number of sides of the subdivided polygons could reach n. - If a subdivided polygon has exactly n sides, then the configuration must be such that every vertex of the n-gon connects to exactly two other vertices via diagonals to form the boundary of the subdivided polygon. 3. Let's denote vertices of the original n-gon as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n. 4. Suppose diagonals A_1A_p and A_1A_q forming the sides of the new polygon originate from vertex A_1. For any vertex A_1 to turn the new polygon to have n sides: - Both A_p and A_q must be neighboring vertices (since diagonals must connect vertices without splitting the boundary's interiors). - This implies that vertices A_p and A_q are adjacent, thereby not adding any new vertex within. - Generally, resulting in q = p + 1. 5. This must hold for every vertex in the original polygon for it to construct a new subdivided polygon having n sides. 6. If every vertex in the original n-gon follows this pattern, no additional vertex diagonals would split the resulting internal smaller polygons into having fewer sides. 7. However, this specific scenario leaves us with the realization that subdividing any original vertex’s diagonals ensures at most n-1 across newly formed polygons. If one additional diagonal is involved: - Every dividing diagonal connects vertices in such a manner that no more than n-1 vertices span within, implying n-1 maximum sides.

This variability in their potential relationship means that we cannot conclusively say m is parallel to n. **Conclusion for A:** Incorrect **For Option B:** If m is parallel to alpha and n is a subset of alpha, then it's clear m does not lie on alpha by the definition of parallelism. The line n, being a subset of alpha, lies entirely within the plane. Although m is parallel to alpha, there's no guarantee that m is parallel to n since they could be in different orientations or even on different planes altogether. **Conclusion for B:** Incorrect **For Option C:** Given m is parallel to alpha and also parallel to beta, we have a scenario where a line is parallel to two planes. This situation does not inherently guarantee that alpha is parallel to beta. They could either be parallel or intersect each other. The parallelism of m to both planes doesn't directly influence the spatial relationship between alpha and beta. **Conclusion for C:** Incorrect **For Option D:** When m is perpendicular to alpha and also perpendicular to beta, we have a unique condition. Two planes that are both perpendicular to the same line must be parallel to each other.

We also know that the slopes of the asymptotes are provided by pm frac{b}{a}; hence we equate sqrt{2} to frac{b}{a}, and without loss of generality, let a^2 = 1 and b^2 = 2. Thus, we can assume the hyperbola's equation is of the form x^2 - 2y^2 = m. Substituting the point (-2, sqrt{3}) into the equation, we get: (-2)^2 - 2(sqrt{3})^2 = m, which simplifies to 4 - 2(3) = m, leading to m = -2. Therefore, the standard equation of the hyperbola is obtained by substituting m back into the assumed form: x^2 - 2y^2 = -2, Dividing the equation by -2, we rewrite it as: frac{x^2}{-2} - frac{2y^2}{-2} = frac{-2}{-2}, which simplifies to: frac{x^2}{2} - y^2 = 1.

We are given that the 75th percentile of 100 data points is 9.3. This means that 75% of the data points are less than or equal to 9.3. 2. Let's evaluate the statements based on this understanding: - Statement A says there must be 75 data points less than or equal to 9.3 among the 100 data points. While this might seem correct at first glance, consider a scenario where all 100 data points are exactly 9.3. In this case, 9.3 is still the 75th percentile, but not in the way A describes. Thus, we cannot say A is universally correct without exceptions. - Statement B suggests that 9.3 is the 75th data point when arranged in ascending order. This interpretation is a common misunderstanding. The 75th percentile doesn't necessarily equate to the 75th data point directly but rather indicates a threshold below which 75% of the data lies. - Statement C claims that when arranging the 100 data points in ascending order, 9.3 is the average of the 75th and 76th data points. Given that 75% of 100 is exactly 75, and by definition, when a percentile falls on an exact index, the percentile value is typically computed as the average between the value at that index and the next. This aligns with how percentiles are calculated in many statistical contexts, making statement C a correct interpretation of the 75th percentile for a sample size of 100. - Statement D posits that 9.3 is the average of the 75th and 74th data points. This interpretation misunderstands the percentile calculation, especially when the percentile falls on a precise number within the dataset's range.

Hence, this cannot be true. 4. **All numbers even:** If all ( x, y, z, u ) are even, let ( x = 2x_1 ), ( y = 2y_1 ), ( z = 2z_1 ), ( u = 2u_1 ): [ (2x_1)^2 + (2y_1)^2 + (2z_1)^2 + (2u_1)^2 = 2 cdot (2x_1)(2y_1)(2z_1)(2u_1) ] [ 4(x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 + u_1^2) = 16 x_1 y_1 z_1 u_1 ] [ x_1^2 + y_1^2 + z_1^2 + u_1^2 = 4 x_1 y_1 z_1 u_1 ] 5. **Iterate the process:** Using similar steps as above, continue reducing all terms to repeatedly introduce smaller powers of 2. This implies all (x, y, z, u) must be powers of 2. 6. **Finally:** Iterating the process shows each term in (x, y, z, u) must be divisible by (2^n) for all ( n ), which is impossible for natural numbers. **Conclusion:** The equation ( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + u^2 = 2xyzu ) has no solutions in natural numbers.

Since no sides are shared and both polygons maintain convexity, intersections can only occur at distinct points along the boundaries of each polygon. 3. **Counting Maximum Intersections**: There are m_1 sides in Q_1 and m_2 in Q_2.

This principle can be applied to solve the problem. This question mainly examines the problem of maximizing and minimizing. It is clear that the larger the digit in a higher place value, the larger the value of the number; conversely, the smaller the value. This rule is key to solving the problem. To maximize the product, we should place the largest numbers in the highest place values and multiply by the next largest number. Therefore, to maximize the product: 8 , 6 , 4 times 2. To minimize the product, we should do the opposite, placing the smallest numbers in the highest place values and multiply by the next smallest number.

Line ( FH ) is parallel and equal in length to ( AE ). Connecting ( BH ) and ( HE ), the extension of ( FE ) intersects ( BH ) at ( G ). Which of the following statements is not necessarily true? (A) ( AEHF ) is a parallelogram. (B) ( HE = EG ). (C) ( BH = DC ). (D) ( FG = frac{3}{4} AB ). (E) ( FG ) is the midline of triangle ( BFH ). 1. **Step 1: Verifying Statement (A):** ( AE parallel FH ) and ( AE = FH ). These two conditions satisfy the definition of a parallelogram because both pairs of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Therefore, ( AEHF ) is a parallelogram. Hence, statement (A) is true. 2. **Step 2: Verifying Statement (C):** Since ( AEHF ) is confirmed as a parallelogram, we know that: [ EH = AF = FC ] and ( EH parallel FC ). Therefore, quadrilateral ( CFHE ) is also a parallelogram, implying ( CH parallel EF parallel AB ) and ( CH = EF = BD ), proving that ( CD parallel BH ) and ( CD = BH ). Hence, statement (C) is true. 3. **Step 3: Verifying Statement (D):** Assume ( EF parallel AC ) and ( EF = frac{1}{2} AB ). Extend to find ( ED ). Since ( AD = DC ) and ( E ) and ( F ) are midpoints, segment ( DE = HE ). This implies that: [ HE = ED ] Considering parallel lines ( EH parallel AF ) and ( DE parallel AF ), the segment ( EG ) becomes: [ EG = frac{1}{2} BD ] Therefore: [ FG = EF + EG = frac{1}{2} AB + frac{1}{2} BD = frac{3}{4} AB ] Hence, statement (D) is true. 4. **Step 4: Verifying Statement (E):** Since ( G ) is the midpoint of ( BH ) by definition and by construction, it must be true that ( G ) is also the midpoint of ( EF ). Hence, ( FG ) is the midline of ( triangle BFH ). Hence, statement (E) is true. 5. **Step 5: Verifying (and disqualifying) Statement (B):** For ( HE = EG ), it would imply that ( D ) and ( B ) are equidistant from ( H ), equating to ( DH = DB ).

Therefore, our solutions suggest that (g(x) = A) for some non-zero constant (A), and (f(x) = C) can be any constant function.

For ( y ) to be an integer, ( 2017 - 111x ) must be divisible by 31.

Praveen invested his amount for 12 months, while Hari invested his amount for only 7 months (since he joined after 5 months). The profit is divided in the ratio of 2:3, which means for every 2 parts of profit that Praveen gets, Hari gets 3 parts. This ratio should be equal to the ratio of their investments multiplied by the time they were invested. So, we can write the equation as follows: (Praveen's investment * Praveen's time) / (Hari's investment * Hari's time) = Praveen's share of profit / Hari's share of profit (P * 12) / (H * 7) = 2 / 3 Now, we know that H (Hari's investment) is Rs. 8640, so we can substitute that into the equation: (P * 12) / (8640 * 7) = 2 / 3 Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for P: 3 * (P * 12) = 2 * (8640 * 7) 36P = 2 * 60480 36P = 120960 Now, divide both sides by 36 to solve for P: P = 120960 / 36 P = 3360 Therefore, Praveen initially invested Rs. boxed{3360} in the business."},{"prompt":"Given A={0,1,2,3} and B={x|x=3a,ain A}, find Acap B.","completion":"First, let's determine set B by substituting the elements of set A into the equation x=3a.

Given: - The sum of the first 1492 terms is 1985. - The sum of the first 1985 terms is 1492. We need to find the sum of the first 2001 terms. Step 1: Identify the Recurring Pattern We begin by examining the terms of the sequence: begin{align*} a_3 &= a_2 - a_1, a_4 &= a_3 - a_2 = (a_2 - a_1) - a_2 = -a_1, a_5 &= a_4 - a_3 = -a_1 - (a_2 - a_1) = -a_1 - a_2 + a_1 = -a_2, a_6 &= a_5 - a_4 = -a_2 - (-a_1) = -a_2 + a_1 = a_1 - a_2. end{align*} Continuing, we find: a_7 = a_6 - a_5 = (a_1 - a_2) - (-a_2) = a_1 - a_2 + a_2 = a_1, which repeats a_1 . Similarly, calculate further terms to see that: a_8 = a_7 - a_6 = a_1 - (a_1 - a_2) = a_2. Therefore, we see that the sequence is periodic with a period of 6: {a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6} Rightarrow {a_1, a_2, a_{2} - a_{1}, -a_{1}, -a_{2}, a_{1} - a_{2}}. Step 2: Calculate the Sum of One Period Summing up one period (6 terms): a_1 + a_2 + (a_2 - a_1) - a_1 - a_2 + (a_1 - a_2) = 0. So, we conclude that: a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 0. Step 3: Express Cross Sectional Sums Given: S_{1492} = 1985 quad text{and} quad S_{1985} = 1492. Since 1492 can be written as 6 times 248 + 4, we have: S_{1492} = 248(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4). Since the sum of one period is 0, we derive: S_{1492} = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) = 1985. Similarly, since 1985 can be written as 6 times 330 + 5, we have: S_{1985} = 330(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5). Again, given the periods sum to zero: S_{1985} = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 1492. Step 4: Solve for Initial Values From the above, we have: begin{align*} a_1 + a_2 + (a_2 - a_1) &= 1985, a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 &= 1492. end{align*} Solving these simultaneously: begin{align*} 2a_2 - a_1 &= 1985, a_2 - a_1 &= 1492. end{align*} Solving these, we get: a_1 = -999 quad text{and} quad a_2 = 493. Step 5: Calculate the Sought Sum Finally, since 2001 = 6 times 333 + 3: S_{2001} = 333(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_2 + a_3). Since the sum of one period is zero: S_{2001} = a_1 + a_2 + (a_2 - a_1). Simplifying: S_{2001} = a_1 + 2a_2 = -999 + 2 times 493 = -999 + 986 = -13.

Depending on whether the circles (S_1) and (S_2) intersect, the inversion can transform them into different geometric entities: - If (S_1) and (S_2) intersect, they can be transformed into a pair of straight lines. - If (S_1) and (S_2) are disjoint, they can be transformed into a pair of concentric circles with a common center (A).

Then the circle we are seeking that is perpendicular to both (S_1) and (S_2) will be transformed into a straight line passing through (A) because there does not exist a circle perpendicular to two concentric circles. The tangent line to (S^*), passing through (A), represents the image of our desired circle after inversion. - If (S_1^*) and (S_2^*) are a pair of parallel lines, the original problem circle translates into one of two possible straight lines (the lines perpendicular to both). 3. **Construct Tangent Line:** Having identified the appropriate geometric entities in the inverted space, construct the tangent line from the point (A) to the transformed circle (S^*). This involves: - Calculating the angle between the point (A) and the circle (S^*). - Ensuring this tangent line intersects (S^*) exactly at one point, ensuring the tangency. 4. **Inverse Transformation Back:** Reverse the inversion to obtain the desired circle in the original space. This inverse transformation translates the tangent line constructed in the inverted space back into a circle that is tangent to (S) and perpendicular to both original circles (S_1) and (S_2). 5. **Conclusion:** The circle tangent to (S) and perpendicular to (S_1) and (S_2) is the one obtained from the inverse transformation step.

Based on the difference of cubes formula a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2), and since the first factor (x^2 + 12)^2 can be treated as (a+b)^2, the whole product simplifies to: [ (x^2 + 12)^2 (x^2 - 12) = (x^2 + 12)(x^2 - 12)(x^2 + 12) = (x^2 - 12^2)(x^2 + 12) = (x^4 - 144)(x^2 + 12). ] Solving this gives us: [ x^6 + 12x^4 - 144x^2 - 1728. ] Doing the calculations step by step: [ x^6 + 12x^4 - 144x^2 - 1728. ] Thus, the final boxed answer is boxed{x^6 + 12x^4 - 144x^2 - 1728}."},{"prompt":"The probability p of an event is defined as the fraction frac{boldsymbol{a}}{m}, where the denominator m represents the number of all equally possible cases, and the numerator a represents the number of those equally possible cases that are favorable to this event.

Testing with A = 14 and C = 18 (which are respectively 7times2 and 9times2): - A = 14 is still valid in base 8. - C = 18 is not valid in base 6.

The question is asking for the number of integer values of n for which the expression 4n + 7 yields a result greater than 1 and less than 100. Since the coefficient of n is already given as 4, we don't need to find it. However, we can verify the number of such values of n by finding the range of n that satisfies the condition 1 < 4n + 7 < 100. First, let's solve the inequality for n: 1 < 4n + 7 -6 < 4n n > -6/4 n > -1.5 Since n must be an integer, the smallest integer value of n that satisfies this inequality is n = -1.

The game involves filling the cells with digits, and the resulting number can start with one or more zeros. Petya wins if the final number is a perfect square; otherwise, Vasya wins. 2. **Strategy for Each Player**: - We need to analyze the strategies that ensure a guaranteed win. - Vasya, playing second, can always implement a strategy to prevent the formation of a perfect square. 3. **Detailed Strategy Explanation**: - **Case 1**: Petya does not put a digit in the last cell on his first move. - Vasya places a digit in the last cell such that it cannot be the last digit of a perfect square. Digits that never appear in the units place of perfect squares (0 to 9) are 2, 3, 7, and 8. Thus, Vasya can choose any of these digits, say 2. - **Case 2**: Petya places a digit in the last cell on his first move. - Vasya places a digit in the second last cell, ensuring the number formed in the final two digits leaves a remainder of 2 or 3 when divided by 4. This guarantees that the number cannot be a perfect square. 4. **Justification Using Number Theory**: - For a number to be a perfect square, it must meet specific remainders when divided by specific bases. - If a number leaves a remainder of 2 or 3 when divided by 4, it cannot be a perfect square. This can be easily verified by checking the squares of numbers modulo 4: - 0^2 = 0 mod 4 - 1^2 = 1 mod 4 - 2^2 = 4 mod 4 - 3^2 = 9 = 1 mod 4 - None of these leave a remainder of 2 or 3. 5. **Example**: - If Petya starts by placing a digit not in the last cell, Vasya can place a 2 in the last cell. - If Petya places a digit in the last cell, say 1, Vasya ensures the second last cell ensures the last two digits give a remainder of 2 or 3 when divided by 4. # Conclusion: Since Vasya can always make a move to prevent the formation of a perfect square after Petya's first move, Vasya has a winning strategy.

If three such angle bisector planes, corresponding to three vertices of the quadrilateral, intersect at some point, then one of the two angle bisector planes of the fourth vertex will pass through this intersection point. 5. Thus, when determining the points equidistant from the lines forming the quadrilateral, we only need to consider the angle bisector planes of three of the angles. Each vertex corresponds to two planes, so there will be a total of eight points of intersection. 6. To show under what conditions three such angle bisector planes do not intersect: since the quadrilateral is spatial, no two bisector planes can be parallel. The only remaining possibility is when one angle bisector plane is parallel to the intersection line of the other two. 7. Suppose the bisector planes of three interior angles of quadrilateral (ABCD) do not intersect. We will introduce auxiliary points and lines to illustrate this: - Draw straight lines through the vertex (C) parallel to sides (AB) and (AD), and place segments (CP) and (CQ) such that (|CP| = |CQ|). Similarly, place segments (CM) and (CN) on sides (CB) and (CD). 8. Since any point equidistant from four lines forms a cone, the quadrilateral (PQNM) will be circumscribed about a circle. Extend this idea to where quadrilateral (PQNM) intersects (AB) and (AD) at points (L) and (K) respectively. The line (LK) will parallel (QP), keeping (NMKL) a circumscribed quadrilateral too. 9. Furthermore, we can verify the bisectors: [ |LB| = |MB|, quad |KD| = |DN|, quad |KA| = |AL| ] This implies: [ |AB| + |DC| = |AD| + |BC| ] 10. Thus, in cases where the sum of any two sides equals the sum of the other two sides, an infinite number of spheres touching the sides (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) can exist.

Since f(1) = 0, there must be one root at x = 1. 2. For x in (1,3), we'll observe the behavior of f(x) based on its previous values. 3. For x in [3,5], again we look at the values of f(x-2) to determine f(x). Next, we need to find the intersection points and condition on a from the graph of f(x) and log_a x in the region of interest. By analyzing the recursive definition, we get the following conditions: begin{align*} f(2) &= 2f(0) = 2(1) = 2 f(4) &= 2f(2) = 4 end{align*} Since log_a x is an increasing function, we must have the log values at x = 2 and x = 4 to be less than the corresponding values of f(x). This gives us: begin{cases} log_a 2 < 2 log_a 4 < 4 end{cases} Using properties of logarithms, we can transform these inequalities: begin{cases} a^{2} > 2 a^{4} > 4 end{cases} From this, we conclude that a > sqrt[2]{2} = sqrt{2} and a > sqrt[4]{4} = sqrt[2]{2} (since 2 < 4). The second inequality does not provide additional information. Thus, the allowed range for a is (sqrt{2}, +infty). However, we must also consider the other restriction that comes from the nature of the logarithmic function and the given options, which suggest an upper bound. Since sqrt{e} is approximately 1.648, closer examination is required to check whether sqrt{e} should be included or excluded, but we can deduce from the given options that the answer would not include values beyond sqrt{e}. Considering the given options, the correct range of a that yields exactly five distinct roots in the interval [1,5] is (sqrt{2},sqrt{e}). Therefore, the answer is: boxed{B: (sqrt{2},sqrt{e})}"},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} that satisfy the following conditions: |overrightarrow{a}| = 1, |overrightarrow{b}| = 2, and overrightarrow{a} cdot (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) = 0, what is the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}?

So we can write: [ W = (M - 5) times R times 50 ] Since the total work ( W ) is the same in both cases, we can set the two equations equal to each other: [ M times R times 40 = (M - 5) times R times 50 ] Now we can solve for ( M ).

Let's consider the given options with a methodical approach, closely aligned with the provided solution, but detailed step by step. - **Option A: a^{2} < ab** Consider a = -2 and b = -1 (both less than 0 and a < b). Then, a^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 and ab = (-2)(-1) = 2. We see that 4 not< 2.

So, option B is also not universally true. - **Option C: a^{2} < b^{2}** Using the same values for a and b, we find a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 1. Here, 4 not< 1, indicating option C is incorrect as well.

Since both a and b are negative and a < b, squaring both numbers makes a^2 and b^2 positive, with a^2 being larger than b^2 because a is farther from 0 than b is (keeping in mind the rule that squaring a larger negative number results in a larger positive number than squaring a smaller negative number).

Here are the detailed steps: 1. **Initial Setup and Definitions**: - We have 10 piles of nuts with counts ranging from 1 to 10. - Players take turns removing one nut at a time. - The game ends when there are exactly 3 nuts left on the table. - If the final 3 nuts are in 3 different piles, the second player wins. Otherwise, the first player wins. 2. **Strategy for the First Player**: - The first player follows these rules: 1. If there are any piles with 1 nut (let's call these \\"singles\\"), the first player always removes one nut from a pile with 1 nut. 2. The first player never takes nuts from piles with exactly 2 nuts (let's call these \\"doubles\\"). - The idea is to always ensure that there are no singles left on the table after the first player makes a move. 3. **Sum and Turn Analysis**: - Initially, the sum of all nuts is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 10 = frac{10 times 11}{2} = 55 quad text{(which is odd)} ] - Each turn decreases the number of nuts by 1, ensuring that before every turn of the first player, the total number of nuts is odd. This implies there is at least one pile with an odd number of nuts present. 4. **Inductive Step**: - After the first player takes a nut from a single pile, no single piles remain. - After the second player’s move, at most one new single pile can appear. The first player then removes a nut from this new single pile if it exists. - This ensures that after the first player’s move, there are no single piles again. - This inductive logic holds for every subsequent turn. 5. **Endgame Analysis**: - When the sum of nuts is 3 (an odd number), there must be an arrangement where the rules are maintained. - Given there should be 3 odd piles (since it's odd total of 3 nuts), this means 3 singles. - If 3 singles are left on the table, the first player leaves the table with 2 singles (an impossible move) and causes the opponent to win. - To generalize, it's expected no piles are split more than singles hence drawing towards the single-pile wins criteria. Thus, given the first player can continually ensure all non-single arrangements effectively forces the opponent towards the final odd-nut condition, first winning. \`\`\` First person maintains removal not to hit direct single into losing condition by odd ensuring intermediate double piles hold over transitions steps.

Since the reaction is in a 1:1 ratio, the limiting reactant will be the one with fewer moles. In this case, NaHCO3 is the limiting reactant because we have only 2.5 moles of it compared to 3 moles of HC2H3O2.

We know that the original price of one box of soap is 16. We don't know the discount percentage yet, but we do know that the total savings from buying 3 liters of chlorine and 5 boxes of soap is 26. The savings from the chlorine alone is: Original cost of 3 liters of chlorine - Discounted cost of 3 liters of chlorine 30 - 24 = 6 Since the total savings is 26, the savings from the soap must be: 26 - 6 = 20 Now, we need to find out the discount on each box of soap that would result in a total savings of 20 when buying 5 boxes.

There are 4 choices for the recipient of each book, leading to a total of 4^5 different combinations. Next, we determine the number of distributions where each student receives at least one book. To ensure each student gets at least one book, we must prevent any student from getting no books at all. We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid overcounting the distributions that leave one or more students without a book. The idea is to calculate the total ways of distributions that leave out at least one student, and then subtract that from the total possible distributions: 1. First, we calculate the number of ways to exclude one particular student and distribute all five books among the remaining three students. There are 3 choices for each of the 5 books, which gives 3^5 combinations. 2. However, there are 4 students, so to exclude any of the students, we have 4 times 3^5 combinations. 3. But this overcounts the distributions that exclude two students because such distributions are subtracted once for each student they exclude. Thus, we need to add back the number of ways to distribute the books among two students. There are 2^5 combinations for two students and binom{4}{2} ways to choose which two students get the books. So, we add binom{4}{2} times 2^5. 4. Finally, if all 5 books go to one student, there are 4 ways for this to happen (one for each student), which we must also subtract given that it's been added one too many times in the previous step.

Thus, the trajectory of (x,y) is an ellipse with foci at (- sqrt {7},0) and ( sqrt {7},0). The major axis a=4, and the distance between the foci c= sqrt {7}, implying the minor axis b=3. So the trajectory equation is dfrac {x^{2}}{16}+ dfrac {y^{2}}{9}=1. When the slope of the line PQ does not exist, due to the symmetry of the ellipse, we have x_{1}=x_{2}, y_{1}=-y_{2}.

To explore the properties of such a triangle, we analyze the construction of a regular hexagon inscribed in the same circle. Since a regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, we will then consider half of this hexagon. We construct a quadrilateral ABCD, which represents half of a regular hexagon inscribed in the circle. This means we look at three equilateral triangles, where A and C are adjacent vertices of the hexagon, and B is the center of the circle. 3. **Calculate the Side Lengths:** For a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle with radius 1: - Each side of the hexagon (equilateral triangle) is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1. - Hence, AB = 1. 4. **Determine AC:** The distance AC covers two side lengths of the hexagon, from A to the adjacent vertex of the hexagon, then to C, forming an arc spanning 120^circ. Thus, by geometry of equilateral triangles, - AC = sqrt{3}, as it forms the side of a 30-60-90 triangle with the hypotenuse being 2cdot1. 5. **Verification of the Squares:** We now need to verify the sum of the squares of AB and AC: [ AB^2 + AC^2 = 1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2 = 1 + 3 = 4 ] 6. **Conclusion:** Since the side length configurations AB = 1 and AC = (sqrt{3}) satisfy the condition (AB^2 + AC^2 = 4), and ABC forms a triangle without any right angle (as 120^circ and its subangles are not right-angled), **Answer:** There exists a non-right-angled triangle inscribed in a circle of radius 1 where the sum of the squares of the lengths of two sides equals 4.

The question is: Is it possible to divide the students into 4 teams such that in any given division method, either exactly three teams are cooperative or exactly one team is cooperative, and both situations will occur?","completion":"1. **Observation of Possible Evaluations**: - We need to prove that for any possible division of 24 students into 4 teams of 6, either exactly three teams are \\"cooperative\\" (能配合), or exactly one team is \\"cooperative\\". 2. **Consider a Subgroup of Three Students**: - Let's observe three specific students among the 24. - We assume the condition that if a team contains any one or all three of these students, then that team is rated as \\"cooperative\\". - Conversely, any team not containing any of these students is considered \\"not cooperative\\" (不配合). 3. **Cases Based on Placement of the Three Students**: - There are several ways these three students can be grouped in the four teams: - If each of these three students is placed in a different team, then all three teams will be cooperative. - If all three students are in the same team, then only this team will be cooperative, making a total of one cooperative team. - If two of these specific students are in the same team, and the remaining one student in another team, then the team with two students will be cooperative, as well as the team with the single student, while both remaining teams without any of these three students will be non-cooperative. Thus resulting in two cooperative and two non-cooperative teams. This case is impossible because it contradicts the problem restrictions. 4. **Result of Division into Teams**: - Therefore, depending on how these three specific students are distributed, we can only achieve: - Exactly three cooperative teams, if they are each in different teams. - Exactly one cooperative team if all three students are in the same team. 5. **Conclusion**: - We have shown that for any way to divide the group into four teams of six, there will always be either three cooperative teams or exactly one cooperative team.

In each step, we divide one of the lengths into two integer lengths and record these lengths. If during any operation, the two resulting lengths are unequal, we call it a \\"good\\" operation. We are to determine the maximum and minimum number of good operations. 1. **Determine the formula for the maximum number of good operations:** Let ( T = {1, 2, ldots, k+1} ) and consider coloring these elements. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be two numbers with the same color, and the sum set ( S_2 ) formed by these sums is: [ S_2 = {3, 4, ldots, 2k+1} ] Since ( S_2 ) is not fully good, the maximum number of \\"good\\" operations ( t_{max} ) is given by: [ t_{max} = 2k - 2 ] 2. **Detail the strategy to achieve the maximum number:** Let's analyze and show that for any positive integer ( a in mathbb{Z}_+ ), the set: [ S_a = {a + 1, a + 2, ldots, a + 2k - 2} ] is good. # Case 1: ( a ) is odd Let ( a = 2b - 1 ) where ( b in mathbb{Z}_+ ), then: [ S_a = {2b, 2b + 1, ldots, 2b + 2k - 3} ] - Color ( 1, 2, ldots, b ) one color. Since any two numbers of this color add up to a number no greater than ( 2b - 1 notin S_a ), it satisfies the conditions. - For the remaining colors, take ( frac{a + 2s - 1}{2} = b + s - 1 ) for ( 2 leq s leq k - 1 ), and each range will cover a distinct color. - If ( n geq b + k - 1 ), color using ( k ) colors, ensuring any two numbers of the same color will not violate ( S_a )'s bounds. # Case 2: ( a ) is even Let ( a = 2c ) where ( c in mathbb{Z}_+ ), then: [ S_a = {2c + 1, 2c + 2, ldots, 2c + 2k - 2} ] - Color ( 1, 2, ldots, c ) one color. Since any two numbers of this color add up to a number no greater than ( 2c - 1 notin S_a ), it satisfies the conditions. - For the remaining colors, select ( c + s - 1 ) for ( 2 leq s leq k - 1 ), and each range will cover a distinct color. - If ( n geq c + k - 1 ), color using ( k ) colors, ensuring any two numbers of the same color will not violate ( S_a )'s bounds. Consequently, achieving the distribution and settings above, the number of good operations reaches the maximum value, which is ( 2k - 2 ). 3. **Determine the minimum number of good operations:** To find the minimum number of good operations, we must optimize for balance, ensuring equal (or as close to equal) divisions as possible throughout each split. Therefore, the minimum number of good operations might be when the splits are closest to maintaining equality, making only unavoidable unequal splits: For an initial length of 2018, dividing it closest to equal repeatedly will minimize bad operations. # In conclusion: - The maximum number of good operations is: [ boxed{2k - 2} ] - The minimum value should be derived via successive optimal splits keeping balance till splits are uniform, which provides the minimal distinct-length recordings.

Now consider all such inequalities for the given n-gon. For each side of the polygon, there are exactly n-3 non-adjacent sides. Summing these inequalities over all pairs of non-adjacent sides, each side length appears in exactly n-3 inequalities on the left-hand side. 4. Let p be the sum of the lengths of the sides of the n-gon. This can be written as: [ p = sum_{i=1}^{n} A_iA_{i+1} ] where ( A_{n+1} equiv A_1 ). 5. Since each side appears in exactly n-3 inequalities, the sum of all left-hand side terms is: [ (n-3)p ] 6. On the other hand, for the diagonals, each diagonal A_mA_n appears in exactly 2 of these inequalities: one corresponding to A_p = A_n, A_q = A_m and another corresponding to A_p = A_{n-1}, A_q = A_{m-1}. 7. Let d be the sum of the lengths of all diagonals of the n-gon. The sum of all right-hand side terms of the inequalities is: [ 2d ] 8. Therefore, we have: [ (n-3)p < 2d ] 9. Dividing both sides by n(n-3)/2, we get: [ frac{p}{n} < frac{2d}{n(n-3)} ] 10. The left-hand side of the inequality represents the arithmetic mean of the side lengths, and the right-hand side represents a value that is proportional to the arithmetic mean of the lengths of the diagonals. Therefore, we conclude that the arithmetic mean of the side lengths of an arbitrary convex polygon is less than the arithmetic mean of the lengths of all its diagonals. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The arithmetic mean of the side lengths of an arbitrary convex polygon is less than the arithmetic mean of the lengths of all its diagonals.}} ]"},{"prompt":"a grid with square cells measuring 1 mathrm{~cm} times 1 mathrm{~cm}, there are three marked points K, O, and Z.

Such divisors take the form 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4 for some prime p. Looking at the prime factorization of 180: [ 180 = 2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5 ] This configuration shows that possibilities include divisors from either 2 or 3. However, 2^4 or higher powers are not divisors of 180; hence, it must depend on divisor powers of 3. Going with 3, we see 3^4 = 81 is not a divisor of 180, but 3^3 = 27 is. Thus, the divisors would be 1, 3, 9, 27, which are all divisors of 180 but make only four divisors, not five. Thus, our initial choice for n must include divisors form both 2 and 3. Next, gcd(180, n) must include 2 since 2^2=4 provides two extra divisors including 2, 4, adding to 1, 3, 9, 27 from the 3. Thus, gcd(180, n) = 27 is feasible, and the divisors of 27 that are also divisors of 180 are 1, 3, 9, 27. This is four divisors but we need five, and the hypothesis is wrong as we cannot reach five distinct divisors without introducing an extra factor, say 2.

This results in: [ sum_{i=1}^{7} d_i text{ is odd} ] 5. **Contradiction**: - The sum of the degrees in any graph must be even (each edge adds 2 to the total degree sum). - However, we have derived that (sum_{i=1}^{7} d_i) is odd. 6. **Conclusion**: - The only way to resolve this contradiction is by including an additional vertex representing the shore, making the sum of degrees even. - Hence, at least one bridge must lead to this additional vertex, the shore of the lake.

We consider two main cases: Case 1: (a = b) If (a = b), the equation becomes: [ (2a)^p = p^a + p^a ] Since (2a = a + a), the equation simplifies to: [ (2a)^p = 2p^a ] Rewriting, we have: [ 2^p cdot a^p = 2p^a ] Dividing both sides by 2, we get: [ 2^{p-1} cdot a^p = p^a ] Here, we see that p must divide (a^p), and since (p) is prime, p must divide (a). Therefore, let (a = kp) for some integer (k), then: [ 2^{p-1} cdot (kp)^p = p^{kp} ] This can be further simplified to: [ 2^{p-1} cdot k^p cdot p^p = p^{kp} ] Now, since (p) is also prime, we compare the powers of (p) on both sides. The left-hand side has the factor (p^p) and the right-hand side has (p^{kp}).

Thus, (a = b = 1). So one possible solution is: [ (a, b, p) = (1, 1, 2) ] Case 2: (a neq b) Without loss of generality, assume (b > a). We can rewrite the original equation as: [ (a+b)^p = p^a + p^b ] Factoring out (p^a) from the right-hand side: [ (a+b)^p = p^a left( 1 + p^{b-a} right) ] Therefore, (p) must divide ((a+b)), so we have: [ (a+b)^p = p^a (1 + p^{b-a}) ] Now consider the powers of (p) on both sides. The right-hand side is (p^a) multiplied by a term that is not divisible by (p) because (1 + p^{b-a} equiv 1 pmod{p}). Given that ((a+b) mid p), we conclude that (p mid a) or (p mid b). Suppose (p mid a): [ a = kp ] Since (p mid a + b), we must have (p mid b). Let (a = kp) and (b = mp), where (k < m). Plugging into the equation yields: [ (kp + mp)^p = p^{kp} + p^{mp} ] Factor out (p^p): [ p^p (k + m)^p = p^{kp} + p^{mp} ] Divide through by (p^p): [ (k + m)^p = p^{kp - p} + p^{mp - p} ] Simplifying further, for equality to hold we would have: [ (k + m)^p = p^{kp - p} + p^{mp - p} ] However, (kp - p geq 0) and (mp - p geq 0). Suppose (k = 0) and (m > 0), we get: [ m^p = p^{mp - p} implies m = 1 implies k = 0 ] Hence, (p = 2).

Describe one of the circles that passes through both ( A ) and ( B ) as circle ( k ) with intersection points ( E ) and ( F ) on line ( e ). 2. **Existence of Intersection Points** Given that line ( e ) separates points ( A ) and ( B ), it follows that line ( e ) also intersects circle ( k ) in two distinct points ( E ) and ( F ). This cuts circle ( k ) into two arcs. 3. **Intersection Theorem** Since ( A ) and ( B ) lie on ( k ), their respective chords ( AB ) and ( EF ) intersect at a point ( M ) inside the circle. By an elementary theorem of intersecting chords: [ ME cdot MF = MA cdot MB ] Here, ( M ) is a fixed point and hence the right-hand side ( MA cdot MB ) is constant irrespective of the choice of circle ( k ). 4. **Geometric-Arithmetic Mean Inequality** To find the shortest chord ( EF ), we apply the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality to ( EM ) and ( MF ): [ EM + MF geq 2 sqrt{EM cdot MF} ] Therefore, the length of the chord ( EF ) can be expressed using this inequality: [ EF = EM + MF geq 2 sqrt{EM cdot MF}=2 sqrt{MA cdot MB} ] This inequality tells us that the length of ( EF ) is minimized when ( EM = MF ), which means ( M ) is the midpoint of ( EF ). 5. **Construction of the Circle ( k_0 )** Hence, the circle ( k_0 ) that cuts the shortest chord ( E_0F_0 ) must have its center ( O_0 ) such that ( M ) is the midpoint of ( E_0F_0 ). This involves constructing a perpendicular from ( M ) to line ( e ), denoted ( m_0 ), and identifying the perpendicular bisector of chord ( AB ), denoted ( f ). The intersection of these perpendiculars ( m_0 ) and ( f ) determines the center ( O_0 ), which in turn specifies the circle ( k_0 ). 6. **Uniqueness and Radius Determination** Since ( AB ) is not parallel to ( e ), the perpendiculars ( m_0 ) and ( f ) are not parallel and thus intersect at a unique point ( O_0 ). The radius of ( k_0 ) is then ( O_0A ) (or ( O_0B ), as ( A ) and ( B ) lie on the circle ( k_0 )). # Conclusion Thus, the circle ( k_0 ) that intersects the shortest chord ( E_0F_0 ) through points ( A ) and ( B ) is uniquely determined by the above construction, establishing the shortest possible chord through the given points.

We don't know the exact distribution of ticket types that would be sold if the theater were full, so we'll have to make an assumption for the calculation. The simplest assumption is that the distribution of ticket types would be the same as the tickets that were actually sold. However, since we don't have enough information to make an accurate distribution, we'll assume that all 50 tickets would be sold at the general admission price for the maximum potential revenue: 50 seats * 10.00 (general admission price) = 500.00 Now, let's calculate the potential revenue lost by not selling out: 500.00 (maximum potential revenue) - 266.00 (actual revenue) = 234.00 Therefore, by not selling out, the movie theater potentially lost boxed{234.00} in revenue."},{"prompt":"Given ten distinguishable rings, let ( m ) be the number of possible sixring arrangements on the four fingers (not the thumb) of one hand.

Next, to arrange six rings in order on the fingers with no finger having more than two rings, consider using the stars and bars theorem but with the additional constraint of at most two rings per finger. This is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to the equation ( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 6 ) where ( 0 leq x_i leq 2 ) for each ( i = 1, 2, 3, 4 ). However, this specific count is more complicated due to the constraints, and is typically done by inclusion-exclusion or dynamic programming. For simplicity, consider the unrestricted arrangement count first: ( binom{6 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = binom{9}{3} ). However, we need to subtract the cases where one or more fingers have more than two rings. This can be done by setting ( x_i > 2 ) and recalculating for ( x_i' = x_i - 3 ) (where one finger has at least three rings, reducing the problem to distributing three rings among four fingers).

Let's analyze part (a). We are given two tangents to a circle, with points of tangency (A) and (B), and the point of intersection of the tangents is (C). We draw another tangent (l) that touches the circle at point (M), and intersects (AC) and (BC) at points (K) and (N) respectively. We need to find the ratio (frac{uv}{w^2}) where (u) and (v) are the distances from (A) and (B) to (l), and (w) is the distance from (C) to (l), given (angle ACB = alpha). 2. Define the following distances: - (|AC| = |BC| = a), - (|AK| = |KM| = x), - (|BN| = |NM| = y). 3. From the geometry of the circle and tangents, it is evident: [ frac{w^2}{uv} = frac{(a-x)(a-y)}{xy}. ] 4. Using the Law of Cosines in (triangle CKN): [ (x + y)^2 = (a - x)^2 + (a - y)^2 - 2(a - x)(a - y) cos alpha. ] 5. After simplifying, we have: [ x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = a^2 - 2ax + x^2 + a^2 - 2ay + y^2 - 2(a - x)(a - y) cos alpha. ] 6. This simplifies further to: [ 2xy = -2ax - 2ay + 2a^2 - 2(a - x)(a - y) cos alpha. ] 7. Rearrange to find (sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}): [ sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}} = frac{xy}{(a-x)(a-y)}. ] 8. Thus, the desired ratio is: [ frac{uv}{w^2} = sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}. ] [ boxed{sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}} ] Next for part (b): 1. Given a polygon inscribed around a circle, and line (l) which is a tangent to the circle but not coinciding with any of the polygon’s sides, we need to prove that the ratio of the product of distances from the vertices of the polygon to (l) to the product of distances from the tangency points (of the polygon’s sides with the circle) to (l) is independent of the position of (l). 2. Using the result from part (a), for each angle (alpha_i) of the polygon: [ frac{uv}{w^2} = sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}. ] 3. Multiplying the corresponding distances for each angle in the (n)-sided polygon: [ left( frac{x_1^2}{y_{2n} y_1} = frac{1}{sin^2 frac{alpha_1}{2}}, frac{x_2^2}{y_1 y_2} = frac{1}{sin^2 frac{alpha_2}{2}}, ldots, frac{x_{2n}^2}{y_{2n-1} y_{2n}} = frac{1}{sin^2 frac{alpha_{2n}}{2}} right). ] 4. Thus: [ frac{x_1 x_2 ldots x_n}{y_1 y_2 ldots y_n} = frac{1}{sin{frac{alpha_1}{2}} sin{frac{alpha_2}{2}} ldots sin{frac{alpha_n}{2}}}. ] Therefore, the ratio remains constant and does not depend on the position of (l). [ blacksquare ] Lastly for part (c): 1. Again applying the result from part (a): [ frac{u v}{w^2} = sin^2{frac{alpha}{2}}. ] 2. We denote the distances from each polygon vertex (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n}) to the line (l) as (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{2n}) respectively, and (y_1, y_2, ldots, y_{2n}) the distances from the tangency points (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{2n}) to (l). 3. For all distance relationships, considering the result and angles guarantees: [ frac{x_1 x_3 ldots x_{2n-1}}{x_2 x_4 ldots x_{2n}} = frac{sin frac{alpha_2}{2} sin frac{alpha_4}{2} ldots sin frac{alpha_{2n}}{2}}{sin frac{alpha_1}{2} sin frac{alpha_3}{2} ldots sin frac{alpha_{2n-1}}{2}}. ] 4. Multiplying and simplifying gives the consistent relationship amongst products of distances to line (l) from odd-numbered and even-numbered vertices. 5. Thus, [ left(frac{x_1 x_3 ldots x_{2n-1}}{x_2 x_4 ldots x_{2n}}right)^2 = frac{(sin frac{alpha_2}{2} sin frac{alpha_4}{2} ldots sin frac{alpha_{2n}}{2})^2}{(sin frac{alpha_1}{2} sin frac{alpha_3}{2} ldots sin frac{alpha_{2n-1}}{2})^2} ] [ blacksquare ]"},{"prompt":"One hundred bricks, each measuring 3''times 8''times 15'', are stacked to form a tower.

Using the point-slope form of the line with the point (1, -2) and the slope 3, the equation of the tangent line is: (y - (-2)) = 3(x - 1), simplifying, we have y + 2 = 3x - 3, or y = 3x - 5.

When modeling, we must consider the practical constraints on the range of values for the independent variable x, and when solving the model, we must also consider the practical aspects of the problem. Transforming practical maximization (minimization) problems into the optimization of function models is one of the most common approaches in optimization problems. (1) Based on the given information, the average comprehensive cost per square meter of the building is the sum of the average construction cost per square meter, 560 + 48x, and the average land cost.

Part (a) - Five Cubes To tackle this, let's first explore the configuration for five cubes. 1. Place three cubes in such a way that they each have one face touching the other two cubes. This arrangement can be visualized in a plane where each of the three cubes is in contact with the other two by one of their faces. 2. Now, these three cubes touch each other in pairs. This contact forms shared square faces between pairs of cubes. 3. To proceed, we consider adding the remaining two cubes. Place these two cubes on the opposite side of the plane such that they will also share faces with the three stationary cubes. Each of the original three cubes must share a face with each of the two new cubes. 4. Hence, we ensure that every added cube touches exactly three existing cubes through perpendicular faces. This ensures that all five cubes have touching faces with each other through their contact squares on the plane. By placing two of the cubes on one side of the plane and three cubes on the other side, we can ensure that each cube shares polygonal faces with every other cube, thus forming a compact structure. [ boxed{text{Possible to arrange five cubes in such a manner.}} ] Part (b) - Six Cubes Now, let's consider arranging six cubes in a similar fashion. 1.

Ensure that these new cubes on the other side of the plane align similarly, making sure that each new cube touches all three original cubes, effectively maximizing their shared contact areas. 4. Since we need each of the six cubes to share polygonal faces with every other cube, verify that each cube contacts the remaining five cubes without conflict in spatial arrangement. By following a methodology similar to the arrangement of five cubes, we can infer that each face contact forms adequate and uninterrupted square face contacts. Hence, by doubling the sectors and strategically placing cubes, touching polygonal faces are indeed possible for six cubes.

We can use this information to confirm the rate at which the loom weaves cloth.

So, the total area of the four walls is: 2 * (25 * 12) + 2 * (x * 12) = 2 * 300 + 2 * 12x = 600 + 24x square feet. Now, we need to subtract the area of the door and the three windows since they are not being whitewashed: Area of the door = 6 feet * 3 feet = 18 square feet. Area of each window = 4 feet * 3 feet = 12 square feet. Total area of the three windows = 3 * 12 = 36 square feet. Total area to be subtracted = Area of the door + Area of the three windows = 18 + 36 = 54 square feet. Therefore, the net area to be whitewashed is: 600 + 24x - 54 = 546 + 24x square feet.

These numbers take the form 100, 125, 150, ..., 975. The sequence starts at 100 and increases by 25 each step, up to 975. These can be represented as 25n, where n ranges from 4 (since 25 times 4 = 100) to 39 (since 25 times 39 = 975). Hence, there are (39-4) + 1 = 36 such numbers. Next, exclude those numbers which are also multiples of 45. To find these numbers, consider the least common multiple (LCM) of 25 and 45. The LCM can be found by the formula, considering the prime factorizations: 25 = 5^2, quad 45 = 3^2 cdot 5, so the LCM is 3^2 cdot 5^2 = 225. Now, find all three-digit multiples of 225. These would be 225, 450, 675, 900. These form 225m, where m ranges from 1 to 4 (since 225 times 4 = 900). Thus, there are 4 such numbers.

Find the range of values for a.","completion":"To solve this problem, we analyze the functions f(x) and g(x) separately and then combine our findings to determine the range of a. **Step 1: Analyzing f(x)** Given f(x) = x - frac{2}{x}, we need to determine its behavior on the interval [1,2]. Since both x and -frac{2}{x} are increasing functions on this interval, their sum, f(x), is also increasing. Therefore, we can find the range of f(x) by evaluating it at the endpoints of the interval: - At x=1, f(1) = 1 - frac{2}{1} = -1. - At x=2, f(2) = 2 - frac{2}{2} = 1. Thus, the range of f(x) on [1,2] is [-1,1]. **Step 2: Analyzing g(x)** Given g(x) = -x^2 + ax - 5, we need to find its minimum value on the interval [2,4] for different values of a. The vertex of a parabola given by y = ax^2 + bx + c is at x = -frac{b}{2a}. For g(x), this translates to x = frac{a}{2}. Depending on the value of a, the vertex will be inside or outside the interval [2,4]. - **Case 1:** When frac{a}{2} leq 3, or equivalently a leq 6, the vertex of the parabola is at or to the left of x=3. Since g(x) is a downward-opening parabola, its minimum value on [2,4] in this case will be at x=4. We calculate this minimum value: [ g(4) = -(4)^2 + 4a - 5 = -16 + 4a - 5 = -21 + 4a. ] For g(x) to meet the condition g(x_2) leq f(x_1), we need -21 + 4a leq -1, which simplifies to 4a leq 20, or a leq 5. - **Case 2:** When frac{a}{2} > 3, or equivalently a > 6, the vertex of the parabola is to the right of x=3. In this case, the minimum value on [2,4] will be at x=2. We calculate this minimum value: [ g(2) = -(2)^2 + 2a - 5 = -4 + 2a - 5 = -9 + 2a. ] For g(x) to meet the condition g(x_2) leq f(x_1), we need -9 + 2a leq -1, which simplifies to 2a leq 8, or a leq 4. However, this contradicts our assumption that a > 6, indicating no solutions in this case. **Combining Results** From the analysis, we find that for g(x_2) leq f(x_1) to always hold, a must satisfy a leq 5.

For our line y = x + 2, we can rewrite it as: -x + y - 2 = 0 Here, A = -1, B = 1, and C = -2. Using the origin (0,0) to find the minimum distance, we get: d = frac{|(-1)(0) + (1)(0) - 2|}{sqrt{(-1)^2 + (1)^2}} = frac{|-2|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} Hence, the minimum value of |OA| is boxed{sqrt{2}}."},{"prompt":"Given that f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}, and f(x)=x^{2}+x+1 when x > 0, find the analytic expression of f(x).","completion":"From the problem, we know that f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}.
