Who has a winning strategy?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine who has a winning strategy: Alice, who aims to align five white pieces, or Bob, who aims to prevent Alice from achieving this. 1. **Description of Strategy:** - Bob can adopt a strategy based on pairing the cells of an infinite grid. The idea is to systematically pair every cell with another cell. If Alice places a white piece (pawn) on one cell, Bob responds by placing a black piece on its paired cell. 2. **Visualizing the Pairing:** - Imagine the grid as being partitioned into disjoint pairs. This means every cell (denoted as (x, y)) on the grid is matched with another unique cell. - For example, a feasible strategy might be pairing (x, y) with (y, x) or any systematic pairing method such that each cell belongs to exactly one pair. 3. **Bob's Moves:** - Every time Alice places a piece on a cell (a, b), Bob places his piece on the paired cell of (a, b). This ensures that whatever configuration Alice tries to create, Bob has an immediate response that disrupts any potential line of five consecutive white pieces for Alice. 4. **Winning Strategy for Bob:** - By ensuring that he always places a black piece whenever Alice places a white piece and keeping the grid such that Alice can never have five consecutive white pawns in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), Bob effectively blocks all possible win configurations for Alice. 5. **Conclusion:** - Given these conditions, Bob can always prevent Alice from creating a line of five consecutive white pieces by systematically following this pairing and response strategy.

Therefore, the function f(x) (x>0) attains its maximum value at x=1, and since f(1)=- frac {1}{e}, we know that f(n) leq - frac {1}{e}, thus for any m,n in (0, +infty), g(m) geq f(n) holds. - For part (I), the minimum value of g(x) in the interval [2,4] is boxed{2ln 2}. - For part (II), it is proven that for any m,n in (0, +infty), g(m) geq f(n) holds, which is boxed{text{True}}."},{"prompt":"The number of subsets of the set {x, y, z} is.","completion":"Since the set {x, y, z} has three elements, the number of subsets of the set is 2^3 = 8; Therefore, the answer is boxed{8}. **Analysis:** For a finite set, we have the following conclusion: If a set contains n elements, then it has 2^n subsets."},{"prompt":"Twentyseven cubes with an edge of 4 centimeters (cm) long were glued together to form one large cube.

Thus, for x=-3, we have: [ f(-3) = [-3] = -3 ] This confirms that statement ① is correct. 2. **Statement ②: If f(a)=f(b), then |a-b| < 1** Given that f(a)=[a] and f(b)=[b], if f(a)=f(b), it means [a]=[b]. Since [a] and [b] are the largest integers not greater than a and b respectively, and they are equal, this implies that a and b must lie within the same interval of integers, thus |a-b| < 1. Therefore, statement ② is correct. 3. **Statement ③: The range of the function y=f(x)-x is [-1,0)** To analyze this, let's consider an example where x=3. In this case, [ f(3)=[3]=3 ] And thus, [ f(3)-3 = 3-3 = 0 ] This shows that 0 is included in the range of y=f(x)-x, contradicting the statement that the range is [-1,0). Hence, statement ③ is incorrect. 4. **Statement ④: The function y=xcdot f(x) is monotonically increasing on [1,+infty)** For x geqslant 1, the function can be represented as: [ y=xcdot f(x)=xcdot [x]=left{begin{array}{l}{x, 1leqslant x<2}{2x, 2leqslant x<3}{3x, 3leqslant x<4}{ldots}end{array}right. ] In each interval, the function y=xcdot [x] increases linearly with x, and as x moves to the next interval, the slope increases (doubles, triples, etc.), ensuring that the function is monotonically increasing throughout left[1,+infty right).

This means: SP2 - C = 1.08(SP1 - C) 420 - C = 1.08(380 - C) 420 - C = 1.08 * 380 - 1.08C 420 - C = 410.4 - 1.08C 420 - 410.4 = 1.08C - C 9.6 = 0.08C C = 9.6 / 0.08 C = 120 So, the cost of the article is Rs. boxed{120} ."},{"prompt":"Let P(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree n > 1, and let k be a positive integer.

This implies that there exists an upper bound on the number of distinct prime factors of ( f(n) ) for any integer ( n ). 2. **Selecting ( n_0 )**: Choose an integer ( n_0 ) such that ( f(n_0) ) has the highest number of distinct prime factors among all values of ( f(n) ) for integers ( n ). 3. **Translation to Assume ( n_0 = 0 )**: By translating the polynomial, we can assume without loss of generality that ( n_0 = 0 ). This involves considering the polynomial ( g(x) = f(x + n_0) ) which will have the same number of prime factors for its outputs as ( f(x) ). 4. **Setting ( k )**: Let ( k = f(0) ).

The number of prime factors of ( f(w k^2) ) is at most the sum of the number of prime factors of ( k ) and ( a k + 1 ). 7. **GCD Condition**: Since ( gcd(a k + 1, k) = 1 ) (because ( a k + 1 ) and ( k ) have no common prime factors apart from 1), ( a k + 1 ) must be a product of new primes not dividing ( k ). 8. **Contradiction**: For different values of ( w ), ( a ) takes different integer values. As ( w ) varies, ( k(a k + 1) ) introduces new primes (because ( a k + 1 ) changes and introduces new prime factors). This contradicts the assumption that ( f(n) ) has a bounded number of distinct prime factors.

Counting these outcomes, we see there are 3 outcomes from the first roll being 1 and 3 outcomes from the first roll being 2, making a total of 3 + 3 = 6 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the probability of the event where the first roll is less than 3 and the second roll is greater than 3 is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes, which is frac{6}{36}.

The highest power of 2 not exceeding ( n ) is exactly a divisor of one of the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, n ), and thus a divisor of ( B(n) ). 3. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose for all ( n geq n_0 ), the numerator ( A(n) ) is a power of a prime number. Let ( p > n_0 + 5 ) be a prime number. Then, since ( S(p-1) ) consists of pairs of terms whose denominators add up to numbers that are divisible by ( p ), ( A(p-1) ) is divisible by ( p ). Consequently, ( A(p-1) = p^k ) for some integer ( k ). 4. **Inductive step**: Prove by induction that ( A(p^n - 1) ) is also divisible by ( p ) for all integers ( n ). The base case has already been established: [ S(p^{n-1} - 1) = frac{A(p^{n-1} - 1)}{B(p^{n-1} - 1)}. ] 5. **Further evaluations**: [ S(p^n - 1) = frac{S(p^{n-1} - 1)}{p} + S^{prime} ] where [ S^{prime} = sum_{d < p^n, p nmid d} frac{1}{d}. ] Breaking down the sum ( S^{prime} ) into ( p^{n-1} ) sums of the form: [ sum_{i=1}^{p-1} frac{1}{pl + i}, quad l = 0, 1, ldots, p^{n-1} - 1, ] shows that each sum has a numerator divisible by ( p ). 6. **Analyze the denominators**: To ensure the numerator of ( frac{S(p^{n-1} - 1)}{p} ) is divisible by ( p ): [ A(p^{n-1} - 1) = p^s ] based on the inductive hypothesis with ( s > 1 ) since ( B(p^{n-1} - 1) geq frac{p}{2} ) and [ S(p^{n-1} -1) geq S(n_0 + 4) geq S(4) > 2 ]. 7. **Construct a contradiction**: Define: [ H_p(n) = S(P^n - n) - S(p^n - 1) = sum_{i=1}^{p-1} frac{1}{i - p^n}. ] If ( n > k ), ( H_p(n) ) has a numerator divisible by ( p^k ) but not by ( p^{k+1} ). Thus, [ S(p^n - 1) quad text{or} quad S(p^n - p) ] must be contained in the interval ( frac{2p^k}{p^n - p} < 1 ) when ( n = k + 2 ).

However, the question asks for the incorrect statement, implying an error in our interpretation. The correct negation process was described, but the assertion that it makes statement A incorrect is itself incorrect.

Since each pair of shoes is a different color, there are 8 pairs, so there are ( 8 times 2 = 16 ) different shoes. The probability of selecting two shoes of the same color without replacement is the probability of picking one shoe of any color and then picking the matching shoe from the remaining ( N - 1 ) shoes. The probability of picking the first shoe of any color is ( frac{16}{N} ), because there are 16 shoes that could be the first pick out of ( N ) total shoes. After picking the first shoe, there is only one shoe that matches its color among the remaining ( N - 1 ) shoes. So the probability of picking the matching shoe as the second shoe is ( frac{1}{N - 1} ). The combined probability of these two independent events (picking any shoe first and then picking the matching shoe) is the product of their probabilities: [ frac{16}{N} times frac{1}{N - 1} = frac{16}{N(N - 1)} ] We are given that this probability is ( frac{1}{15} ) or ( 0.06666666666666667 ).

For the smallest radius, the shortest side should be the tangent of the circles. - Using the semi-perimeter ( s ) and ( t ), given ( 2 varrho s = 2t = cm_c ), we revise: [ r = frac{c t}{c s + 2 t} = frac{t}{s + m_c} = frac{c sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}{c sqrt{s} + 2 sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}} ] 6. **Exploring Different Configurations**: - The figure shows different configurations of circles tangent to triangle sides. - The circles can be placed based on the common external or internal tangents, affecting the calculation similarly by changing trigonometric functions or signs. 7. **Generalizing the Solution**: - Considering the setup with circles on various angles and sides, revising for ( alpha ) and ( beta ) gives: [ c + r cot frac{alpha}{2} = r cot frac{beta}{2} ] Which leads to: [ r = frac{c}{cot frac{beta}{2} - cot frac{alpha}{2}} ] This concludes the generalized derivation for setting up and calculating the radius of two identical tangent circles within or around a triangle.

We are to determine the possible values of l. 1. **Initial Setup:** Each point can connect to at most m-1 other points. When each point connects to l other points, the entire graph will have frac{1}{2}ml line segments because each line segment is counted twice, once at each endpoint. Therefore, ml must be an even number. 2. **Condition Derivation:** - Since ml must be even, ml in 2mathbb{Z}, the set of even numbers. - The necessary condition is ( l < m ) and ( ml in 2mathbb{Z} ). 3. **Example Construction:** Let's number the ( m ) points as ( 1, 2, ldots, m ) and arrange them in a circle, thus each point is equidistant from its neighbors. - If ( l ) is even: For any given point, connect it to the l/2 points in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. This ensures each point is connected to exactly l other points. 4. **Even ( l ) Illustration:** Each point i is connected to (i+1, i+2, ldots, i+frac{l}{2}) and (i-1, i-2, ldots, i-frac{l}{2}) mod m. Thus, all points are connected to exactly l points. 5. **Odd ( l ) Consideration:** When l is odd, m must be even. Let l = 2k+1, where ( k ) is an integer. In this case, we can follow methods similar to the even case but using odd extensions. Each point will connect to l-1 points as depicted earlier. 6. **Combining Insights:** If l is odd, since l-1 is even, we use the strategy from the even case noted above, and since ( m ) is even, divide m into frac{m}{2} pairs of points. Each pair (opposite on the circle) can thus be connected directly. # Conclusion The values of ( l ) must be such that ( 1 le l < m ) and ( ml ) is even: - If ( l ) is even, this condition is straightforward. - If ( l ) is odd, ( m ) must also be even to satisfy the even product condition.

Case 1: Point P lies outside circle S 1. Perform a projective transformation that sends the circle S to another circle and the point P to a point at infinity. This transformation simplifies the problem by converting the original problem into a more manageable form where the analysis can be conducted under simpler conditions. Refer to theorem on projective transformations (similar to problem 30.17). 2. Under this transformation, all lines passing through P become parallel lines in the transformed plane. Consequently, the lines that intersect at P are parallel after the transformation. 3. Therefore, in problem ( text{a)} ), the locus of points of intersection of tangents to (S) drawn at the two points of intersection of the secants will map to a line parallel to the original tangents in the transformed plane. Consequently, the sought-for geometric locus (GMT) is a line ( l ) perpendicular to the parallel lines, passing through the center of circle (S).

It might be a multiple of 2, or it might not be. This outcome depends on the specific seat assignment process and the current availability of seats. Therefore, this event is not certain but rather random. - **Option B:** Turning on the TV to a specific channel at any given time without prior knowledge of the programming schedule makes the event of it playing \\"The Reader\\" random. The content being broadcasted at any moment is subject to the channel's schedule, which varies. Hence, this is a random event. - **Option C:** When oil is dropped into water, due to the difference in density between oil and water, with oil being less dense, it will float on the surface of the water. This is a consistent outcome based on the physical properties of these substances. Therefore, this event is certain to happen every time oil is introduced to water under normal conditions. - **Option D:** The sun rising from the west is contrary to the observed and well-established astronomical phenomenon of the sun rising in the east due to the Earth's rotation direction.

This means the new length of the rectangle (which is now a square) is L - 4 and the new width is W + 3. Since it's a square, both sides are equal: L - 4 = W + 3 Now, the area of the square (which is the same as the area of the original rectangle) is: (L - 4) * (W + 3) = L * W Expanding the left side of the equation, we get: LW + 3L - 4W - 12 = LW Since LW is on both sides of the equation, we can cancel it out: 3L - 4W - 12 = 0 Now, we need to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for L: 3L = 4W + 12 L = (4W + 12) / 3 Now we have L in terms of W. We can substitute this back into the equation L - 4 = W + 3 to find the value of W: ((4W + 12) / 3) - 4 = W + 3 (4W + 12 - 12) / 3 = W + 3 4W / 3 = W + 3 4W = 3W + 9 W = 9 Now that we have the width, we can find the length: L = (4W + 12) / 3 L = (4 * 9 + 12) / 3 L = (36 + 12) / 3 L = 48 / 3 L = 16 So the original rectangle has a length of 16 cm and a width of 9 cm.

A: necessary and sufficient condition B: necessary but not sufficient condition C: sufficient but not necessary condition D: neither necessary nor sufficient conditio","completion":"To analyze the relationship between angles and their sines in a triangle, let's consider the given information step by step: 1. **Starting with the Law of Sines:** We have frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = 2R, where a and b are the sides opposite angles A and B respectively, and R is the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC. This is a fundamental property of any triangle. 2. **Given sin A > sin B:** By the Law of Sines, this inequality implies that frac{a}{2R} > frac{b}{2R}. Since 2R is a common factor and is positive, we can simplify this to a > b. This is a direct consequence of the given inequality. 3. **From a > b to A > B:** In a triangle, if one side is longer than another, the angle opposite the longer side is larger. Therefore, a > b implies A > B. This is a basic geometric property. 4. **Conversely, given A > B:** If A > B, then by the property of triangles, the side opposite the larger angle is longer, meaning a > b. This is the reverse implication of step 3. 5. **Relating a > b back to sin A and sin B:** Since a = 2Rsin A and b = 2Rsin B, and we know a > b, substituting these expressions gives 2Rsin A > 2Rsin B. Again, 2R is a positive common factor and can be canceled out, leading to sin A > sin B. This completes the reverse implication. 6. **Conclusion:** Since we have shown that \\"A > B\\" implies \\"sin A > sin B\\" and vice versa, the statement is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the inequality between the sines of angles in a triangle.

The product of numbers is odd if and only if each number in the product is odd. A standard die has six faces, numbered 1 through 6. Of these, the odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5.

This means the probability of rolling an odd number on a single roll is frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}.

Now, calculate each derivative separately: [ frac{d}{dx}(10x^3) = 30x^2. ] For the term ( 4x^2y ): [ frac{d}{dx}(4x^2y) = 4x^2 frac{dy}{dx} + 4y frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 4x^2 y' + 8xy. ] For the term ( y^2 ): [ frac{d}{dx}(y^2) = 2y frac{dy}{dx} = 2yy'. ] Putting these results together: [ 30x^2 + 4x^2y' + 8xy + 2yy' = 0. ] 4. Combine the terms involving ( y' ): [ 30x^2 + 4x^2y' + 8xy + 2yy' = 0 implies 4x^2y' + 2yy' = -30x^2 - 8xy. ] 5. Factor out ( y' ) from the left side: [ y'(4x^2 + 2y) = -30x^2 - 8xy. ] 6. Solve for ( y' ): [ y' = frac{-30x^2 - 8xy}{4x^2 + 2y}. ] Simplify: [ y' = frac{-15x^2 - 4xy}{2x^2 + y}. ] 7.

The length of the goods train is approximately 470.06 m. What is the length of the platform?","completion":"To find the length of the platform, we first need to determine the distance the goods train covers while crossing the platform. The speed of the goods train is given as 72 kmph. To convert this speed into meters per second (m/s), we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s. So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 72 kmph * (5/18) = 20 m/s The time taken to cross the platform is given as 36 seconds. The distance covered while crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. We can calculate this distance using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The distance covered by the train while crossing the platform is: Distance = 20 m/s * 36 s = 720 meters The length of the goods train is approximately 470.06 meters. To find the length of the platform, we subtract the length of the train from the total distance covered: Length of the platform = Distance covered - Length of the train Length of the platform = 720 m - 470.06 m Length of the platform = 249.94 m Therefore, the length of the platform is approximately boxed{249.94} meters."},{"prompt":"Koschei the Immortal kidnapped the king's three daughters.

By understanding how each additional line creates new sections, we can devise a method to segment the circle correctly. 1. **Dividing the Circle into 4 Parts:** To divide a circle into 4 parts, we can do the following: - Draw the first line any direction passing through the center. - Draw the second line perpendicular to the first line, also passing through the center. Now, we have 4 equal parts. [ boxed{4 text{ parts}} ] 2. **Dividing the Circle into 5 Parts:** To divide a circle into 5 parts, we follow these steps: - First, draw two lines perpendicular to each other through the center, which creates 4 parts. - Then, draw a third line that does not pass through the center and intersects all four of the existing parts, thus creating 5 parts.

A dodecahedron has 20 vertices, and any rotation that brings a vertex into the position of the original fixed vertex is a valid symmetry operation here. However, the set of rotations around one fixed face (excluding other types of symmetry just for simplicity and since it’s harder to enumerate all of them) is still sizeable. Relatively, the number of possible face rotations that involve leaving the initially chosen face unchanged but rotating the dodecahedron so other faces change position can be considered. Just as the octahedron had three rotations about one axis, the dodecahedron has more complex symmetry due to having pentagonal faces and overall shape, yet rotations around a single axis through two opposite vertices would consist of exactly five (for each pentagon face that can come to the front). For simplicity in counting and in avoiding over-counting complex symmetries not easily trackable in a simple product-based multiplication counting method, and to avoid falling into complicating detailed geometrical group theory, assume slightly simpler symmetry of 5 rotations about one fixed color. So, the number of distinguishable configurations is (frac{11!}{5}). [frac{11!}{5} = frac{39916800}{5} = 7983360] Conclusion: The total number of distinguishable ways to construct a colored dodecahedron where no two can be rotated to look the same, given complete control of all colors and one color fixed in place, considering only simple vertex rotation symmetries, is (boxed{7983360})."},{"prompt":"To understand the weight situation of all seventhgrade students in the city, a sample of 500 students was drawn.

To find the relative speed in meters per second (m/s), we convert the speeds from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 hour): Relative speed = (Speed of first train + Speed of second train) * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) Relative speed = (60 kmph + 48 kmph) * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) Relative speed = (108 kmph) * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) Relative speed = 108,000 m/h / 3600 s/h Relative speed = 30 m/s Now, we know the time they take to cross each other is 9.99920006399488 seconds. During this time, the two trains together cover a distance equal to the sum of their lengths. Let the length of the first train be L meters. Total distance covered = Length of first train (L) + Length of second train (160 m) We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time Total distance covered = Relative speed * Time taken to cross each other L + 160 m = 30 m/s * 9.99920006399488 s L + 160 m = 299.976001919847 m Now, we solve for L: L = 299.976001919847 m - 160 m L = 139.976001919847 m Therefore, the length of the first train is approximately boxed{139.98} meters."},{"prompt":"There are 2019 students sitting around circular table.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the process: 1. **Prepare the Equipment**: - Ensure you have a sheet of paper (preferably from a notebook). - Equip yourself with a pair of scissors. 2. **Fold the Paper**: - Start by folding the paper in half. This will be your starting point for creating the hole. 3. **Initial Cuts**: - Make a series of parallel cuts along the folded edge of the paper. Be careful not to cut completely through to the other side. Leave about a centimeter or so uncut. - Ensure the cuts are evenly spaced apart and extend almost to the edges of the paper. 4. **Additional Cuts**: - Once you have finished making the parallel cuts, you will need to make a series of perpendicular cuts. - These perpendicular cuts should be made on the side of the paper opposite to the folded edge and they should intersect the uncut spaces left by the parallel cuts. This step will help in creating a flexible grid-like structure. 5. **Unfold the Paper**: - Carefully unfold the paper. You will see a web of cuts creating a large, flexible grid. - Gently stretch the grid to see just how large this opening can become. 6. **Realign the Cuts if Necessary**: - If required, re-fold and re-trim any parts to even out the grid and ensure maximum flexibility. - This may take a few iterations of cutting and unfolding to perfect. # Conclusion: This process effectively transforms the sheet of paper into a flexible structure that, when stretched, produces an opening far larger than seems possible from the original dimensions of the notebook sheet.

The first player aims to ensure that at least one rational number remains within the intersection of all chosen intervals, while the second player aims to prevent this. To solve the problem, we analyze the winning strategy for the second player. Here's a detailed explanation of the solution: 1. **Initial Assumption**: - Let [a_1, b_1] be the initial interval chosen by the first player. - The second player aims to choose a subinterval [a_2, b_2] subset [a_1, b_1] such that it does not include any rational numbers of a certain form. 2. **Strategy Description**: - The second player can always select a subinterval that avoids certain rational numbers by systematically excluding specific forms of rational numbers in each move. - Specifically, in their first move, the second player can ensure that the chosen interval does not contain any rational number of the form frac{m}{1}, where m is an integer. This means the interval chosen does not contain any integers. 3. **Subsequent Moves**: - On the second turn, the second player ensures that none of the rational numbers of the form frac{m}{2}, where m is an integer, lie within the chosen interval. This interval will therefore avoid any rational numbers with a denominator of 2. - On the n-th turn, the second player selects a subinterval that does not include rational numbers of the form frac{m}{n}, where m is an integer. 4. **Justification**: - By employing this strategy iteratively, the second player can always select a subinterval devoid of rational numbers that can be expressed with specific denominators. - With each move, the set of rational numbers potentially in the intersection of all chosen intervals becomes sparser in terms of inclusion criteria. Therefore, as the game progresses indefinitely, the second player's strategy ensures that any specific rational number eventually gets excluded because of its denominator's exclusion in some player's turn. 5. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: - If a rational number frac{p}{q} for integers p and q is expected to exist in the intersection of intervals, it must be included in every chosen interval by both players. However, this contradicts the strategy where the second player excludes intervals containing rational numbers with the denominator q. Thus, the second player has a winning strategy: by carefully choosing intervals in each turn, the second player can prevent any rational number from remaining in the intersection of all intervals. This results in the first player being unable to achieve their goal.

This is a consequence of the polynomial having integer coefficients, which implies that: [ p(x) - p(y) = (x - y) cdot Q(x,y) ] for some polynomial ( Q(x, y) ) with integer coefficients. 2. **Given conditions:** Suppose: - ( p(a) = 1 ) for some integer ( a ), - ( p(b) = 3 ) for some integer ( b ).

The barycentric coordinates of the line ( AG ) can be written as ( (A : a, B : 1, C : 1) ) for some ( a in mathbb{R} ). 4. The point ( A^{prime} ) has the barycentric coordinates ( (A : 0, B : 1, C : 1) ), which means it lies on the line ( AG ). 5. Similarly, ( B^{prime} ) lies on the line ( BG ) and ( C^{prime} ) lies on the line ( CG ). 6. Therefore, the medians ( left(A A^{prime}right), left(B B^{prime}right), left(C C^{prime}right) ) are concurrent at point ( G ). 7. Since the point ( G ) has coordinates ( (A : 1, B : 1, C : 1) ), and it can also be expressed as ( (A : 1, A^{prime} : 2) ).

Therefore, ( h ) maps the circumcenter ( O ) to another point ( H ) such that ( overrightarrow{GH} = -2 overrightarrow{GO} ). 5.

Using the relation ( overrightarrow{GH} = -2 overrightarrow{GO} ), it follows that ( overrightarrow{G Omega} = frac{1}{4} overrightarrow{GH} ) and thus ( Omega ) is the midpoint of ( [OH] ). 5. Since ( Omega ) is midway along ( [OH] ), and perpendiculars from ( Gamma ) to sides ( BC ) involving ( A^{prime} ) and ( H_A ), make both equidistant from ( Omega ): - ( A^{prime} ) and ( H_{A} ) are equidistant from ( Omega ). 6.

Adding these inequalities, we get A + B + C > 60^{circ} + 60^{circ} + 60^{circ}, which simplifies to A + B + C > 180^{circ}. 3. However, we know from the fundamental theorem about triangles that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is exactly 180^{circ}, i.e., A + B + C = 180^{circ}. 4. This leads to a contradiction because our assumption that A + B + C > 180^{circ} cannot be true if the sum of the angles must equal 180^{circ}. Therefore, our initial assumption must be incorrect. This means that not all three interior angles can be greater than 60^{circ}. Hence, at least one of the interior angles must be less than or equal to 60^{circ}. The method used in this proof is known as proof by contradiction, where we assume the opposite of what we're trying to prove and show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

The revenue derived from the tax is then T * C. When the tax is diminished by 25%, the new tax rate becomes T - (25/100) * T = 0.75 * T. When the consumption is increased by 10%, the new consumption becomes C + (10/100) * C = 1.10 * C. The new revenue derived from the tax is (0.75 * T) * (1.10 * C). To find the decrease percent in the revenue, we compare the new revenue to the original revenue: Decrease in revenue = Original revenue - New revenue = (T * C) - (0.75 * T) * (1.10 * C) = TC - 0.825TC = 0.175TC The decrease percent in the revenue is: (Decrease in revenue / Original revenue) * 100 = (0.175TC / TC) * 100 = 0.175 * 100 = 17.5% So, the decrease percent in the revenue derived from the commodity is boxed{17.5%} ."},{"prompt":"A hexagon is constructed with its sides having alternating lengths of 3 and 2.

The slope ( m ) of a line passing through two points ( (x_1, y_1) ) and ( (x_2, y_2) ) is given by the formula: [ m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} ] For points A(10, 3) and B(−8, −6), the slope ( m_{AB} ) is: [ m_{AB} = frac{-6 - 3}{-8 - 10} = frac{-9}{-18} = frac{1}{2} ] Now, let's find the slope of the line that passes through points B and C. Since the slope between points A and B is equal to the slope between points B and C, we have: [ m_{BC} = m_{AB} = frac{1}{2} ] For points B(−8, −6) and C(4, k), the slope ( m_{BC} ) is: [ m_{BC} = frac{k - (-6)}{4 - (-8)} = frac{k + 6}{12} ] Setting the two slopes equal to each other, we get: [ frac{k + 6}{12} = frac{1}{2} ] Cross-multiplying to solve for ( k ): [ 2(k + 6) = 12 ] [ 2k + 12 = 12 ] [ 2k = 0 ] [ k = 0 ] So the value of ( k ) is 0, and point C is (4, 0). Now, let's find the equation of the line. We can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is: [ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) ] Using point A(10, 3) and the slope ( m = frac{1}{2} ), the equation of the line is: [ y - 3 = frac{1}{2}(x - 10) ] To find the x-intercept, we set ( y = 0 ) and solve for ( x ): [ 0 - 3 = frac{1}{2}(x - 10) ] [ -3 = frac{1}{2}x - 5 ] [ frac{1}{2}x = -3 + 5 ] [ frac{1}{2}x = 2 ] [ x = 4 ] So the x-intercept of the line is 4. To write the equation in standard form, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction: [ 2(y - 3) = x - 10 ] [ 2y - 6 = x - 10 ] [ x - 2y = -10 + 6 ] [ x - 2y = -4 ] Therefore, the equation of the line in standard form is ( x - 2y = boxed{-4} ), and the x-intercept is 4."},{"prompt":"Consider the quadratic equation 5x^2 6x 12 = 0.

Each side of this hexagon corresponds to the length of the side of the place mat that lies along the edge of the table. 3. **Hexagon Side Length**: The circumference of the circle (table) is 2pi times 4 = 8pi.

If we transpose the line ( l ) towards region ( a ) until it passes through one of the points, the sum of the distances from the points to the line will decrease. This is because moving the line closer to the points in ( a ) reduces their perpendicular distances to the line. 3. **Line Passing Through a Vertex**: For the smallest possible sum of distances, the line ( l ) must pass through one of the vertices of the triangle, say ( A_1 ), and separate the other two points ( A_2 ) and ( A_3 ). 4. **Dependence on Angle**: The sum of the distances from ( A_2 ) and ( A_3 ) to the line ( l ) is dependent on the angle ( alpha ) formed by the line and the side ( A_2A_3 ). Specifically, the sum of the distances is given by ( A_2A_3 sin alpha ). 5. **Minimizing the Angle**: The smallest possible value of ( alpha ) occurs when the line ( l ) is perpendicular to ( A_2A_3 ).

Therefore, if we exclude any one digit, the sum of the remaining digits (45 minus that digit) still needs to be divisible by 9. - Excluding 0 results in a sum of 45 (which is still divisible by 9), and excluding 9 results in a sum of 36 (which is also divisible by 9). 3. **Analyzing Kolya's Numbers:** - A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. - Kolya is counting 10-digit numbers with all digits being distinct, meaning that each digit from 0 to 9 must be used exactly once. 4. **Constructing a Correspondence:** - To construct a bijection (1-to-1 correspondence) between Anya's and Kolya's numbers, consider the following: - Take an Anya's 9-digit number that contains every digit except one missing digit (either 0 or 9). - Append the missing digit to form a 10-digit number. - Swap '5' and '9' if '9' is not already the last digit to ensure the number ends in either '0' or '5', making it divisible by 5. - For Kolya's numbers, given that they end in either '0' or '5', simply swap '9' back to the correct place and remove the last digit to get back Anya's form. 5. **Counting the Numbers:** - There are 9! (9 factorial) ways to permute the remaining 9 digits after choosing which digit to exclude in Anya's case. - Since there are 2 choices for the digit to be excluded (0 or 9), the total count for Anya's case is (2 times 9!). - Kolya's 10-digit numbers, using every digit exactly once and ending in 0 or 5, also need the remaining 9 digits to be permuted. - Hence, for each of the 2 possible last digits, there are 9! ways to arrange the first 9 digits, resulting in a count of (2 times 9!). 6. **Conclusion:** - Both Anya and Kolya end up counting the same number of numbers, each forming a set of (2 times 9!) numbers.

Thus, we get: [ 1.02^{8} approx C_{8}^{0} + C_{8}^{1} cdot 0.02 + C_{8}^{2} cdot 0.02^{2} + C_{8}^{3} cdot 0.02^{3} ] Calculating the binomial coefficients and the terms gives us: [ 1.02^{8} approx 1 + 8 cdot 0.02 + 28 cdot 0.0004 + 56 cdot 0.000008 ] [ 1.02^{8} approx 1 + 0.16 + 0.0112 + 0.000448 ] [ 1.02^{8} approx 1.171648 ] Since we are asked to round to three decimal places, we get: [ 1.02^{8} approx boxed{1.172} ]"},{"prompt":"f 35 percent of 400 is 20 percent of x , then x =","completion":"To solve for x, we can set up the following equation: 35% of 400 = 20% of x First, we convert the percentages to decimals: 0.35 * 400 = 0.20 * x Now, we can solve for x: 140 = 0.20 * x To isolate x, we divide both sides by 0.20: x = 140 / 0.20 x = 700 Therefore, x = boxed{700} ."},{"prompt":"Given the Cartesian coordinate system (xOy) where O is the origin, the positive semiaxis of the xaxis is the polar axis, and the polar coordinates of point P are (4sqrt{3}, frac{pi}{6}).

Therefore, the Cartesian coordinates of point P are (6, 2sqrt{3}). From the given polar equation of curve C, {rho}^{2} + 4sqrt{3}rho sin theta = 4, we can convert it to the standard equation by substituting rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 and rho sin theta = y: x^2 + y^2 + 4sqrt{3}y = 4, which can be rewritten as (x^2 + (y + 2sqrt{3})^2 = 16.

There are 4 possible bases (H, M, N, T) for the first base in a pair. - For the second base in the pair, there are 3 remaining choices (since it must be distinct from the first base). - Therefore, there are (4 times 3 = 12) ways to choose the bases for each pair. 2. **Determine the number of ways to arrange the bases in each strand:** - We need to ensure that H and M do not appear next to each other, and N and T do not appear next to each other. - For the first base in the strand, there are 4 choices (H, M, N, T). - For the second base, there are 3 choices (since it cannot be the same as the first base and must not violate the adjacency rule). - For the third base, there are again 3 choices (since it cannot be the same as the second base and must not violate the adjacency rule). - This pattern continues for the fourth and fifth bases. 3. **Calculate the number of valid sequences for one strand:** - For the first base, there are 4 choices. - For the second base, there are 3 choices. - For the third base, there are 3 choices. - For the fourth base, there are 3 choices. - For the fifth base, there are 3 choices. - Therefore, the number of valid sequences for one strand is (4 times 3^4). 4. **Calculate the total number of valid DNA sequences:** - Since each DNA sequence consists of two strands, and each strand must be valid independently, we need to consider the number of ways to pair the strands. - The total number of valid DNA sequences is given by the product of the number of ways to choose the bases for each pair and the number of valid sequences for each strand. - Therefore, the total number of valid DNA sequences is (12 times (4 times 3^4)^2). 5. **Simplify the expression:** - (4 times 3^4 = 4 times 81 = 324). - Therefore, the total number of valid DNA sequences is (12 times 324^2). 6. **Calculate the final result:** - (324^2 = 104976). - Therefore, the total number of valid DNA sequences is (12 times 104976 = 1259712).

Let the rate at which the first carpenter works be ( C_1 ) jobs per day, and the rate at which the second carpenter works be ( C_2 ) jobs per day.

He would need 6 more days to finish the job alone, so his rate ( C_1 ) is such that ( 6 times C_1 = 1 - C_1 ) (since he already completed ( C_1 ) of the job on the first day). When the first and second carpenter work together for 5 days, they complete the remaining job, which is ( 1 - C_1 ). Their combined rate is ( C_1 + C_2 ), so ( 5 times (C_1 + C_2) = 1 - C_1 ). Now, let's solve for ( C_1 ) from the first equation: [ 6C_1 = 1 - C_1 ] [ 7C_1 = 1 ] [ C_1 = frac{1}{7} ] Now we can solve for ( C_2 ) using the second equation: [ 5 times left(frac{1}{7} + C_2right) = 1 - frac{1}{7} ] [ 5 times frac{1}{7} + 5C_2 = frac{6}{7} ] [ frac{5}{7} + 5C_2 = frac{6}{7} ] [ 5C_2 = frac{6}{7} - frac{5}{7} ] [ 5C_2 = frac{1}{7} ] [ C_2 = frac{1}{35} ] So the second carpenter's rate is ( frac{1}{35} ) jobs per day.

The number of ways to choose 8 flowers from F is given by the combination formula: C(F,8) = F! / (8! * (F-8)!)

Since ( n ) is not divisible by 3, ( n ) and 3 are coprime, i.e., gcd(n, 3) = 1. According to Bézout's identity, there exist integers ( u ) and ( v ) such that: [ 1 = u n - 3 v ] 2. Starting from Bézout's identity: [ 1 = u n - 3 v ] we can multiply through by (60^circ) to obtain: [ 60^circ = u n cdot 60^circ - 3 v cdot 60^circ ] 3. Given that: [ frac{180^circ}{n} = 60 cdot frac{3}{n} ] we can substitute and simplify the above expression: [ 60^circ = u n cdot 60^circ - 3 v cdot 60^circ = u n cdot 60^circ - v cdot 180^circ ] 4.

Since ( frac{60^circ}{n} = frac{1}{3} cdot left( frac{180^circ}{n} right) ), it follows that we effectively have trisected the angle ( frac{180^circ}{n} ) using a constructible angle ( 60^circ ) and arithmetic operations with known and constructible angles. 8.

Thus: [ f^2(x) = x + M + 2 ] 3. Similarly, if for (i = 1, ldots, l), (f^l(x) = x + M + l), then: [ f^{l+1}(x) = f(f^l(x)) = f(x + M + l) = x + M + l + 1 + a_i ] Also: [ f^{l+1}(x) = x + l + 1 + a_j ] So we get: [ M + l + 1 + a_i = l + 1 + a_j implies M + a_i = a_j implies a_i = 0, a_j = M ] Therefore, for all (j), (f^j(x) = x + j + M). 4.

Hence, [ sin(-2alpha) = -sin(2alpha) = -2sin(alpha)cos(alpha) ] We know that tan(alpha) = frac{sin(alpha)}{cos(alpha)}, so [ -2sin(alpha)cos(alpha) = -2tan(alpha)cos^2(alpha) = -2 cdot 2 cdot cos^2(alpha) ] Since tan^2(alpha) + 1 = sec^2(alpha), and sec(alpha) = frac{1}{cos(alpha)}, we have cos(alpha) = frac{1}{sqrt{tan^2(alpha) + 1}}. Therefore, [ cos(alpha) = frac{1}{sqrt{2^2 + 1}} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}} ] Substituting back into our expression: [ -4cos^2(alpha) = -4left(frac{1}{sqrt{5}}right)^2 = -frac{4}{5} ] Thus, [ cos left( frac{2015pi}{2}-2alpha right) = boxed{-frac{4}{5}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let x, y, and z be real numbers such that [cos x + cos y + cos z = sin x + sin y + sin z = cos x + sin y + cos z = 0.] Find the sum of all possible values of cos 2x + cos 2y + cos 2z.","completion":"Let a = e^{ix}, b = e^{iy}, and c = e^{iz}.

What is the probability that they all have length (frac{1}{8})? 1. **Total number of breaks needed:** To achieve 8 pieces of chalk, we need to make 7 breaks in total since each break increases the number of pieces by 1. - Initially, we have 1 piece. - Each break adds one piece. - Therefore, Number of breaks needed = 7. 2. **Total possible sequences of breaks:** Each break splits one piece into two, and since which piece to break is chosen randomly, the total number of different sequences of 7 breaks is the number of permutations of 7 distinct items: [ 7! = 5040. ] 3. **Configuration for exactly 8 pieces of length (frac{1}{8}):** - After these 7 breaks, we must ensure that every piece is of length (frac{1}{8}). This means each break precisely halves one of the existing pieces until we achieve 8 pieces, each of length (frac{1}{8}). 4. **Calculating the number of favorable sequences:** - The first break leaves us with pieces of lengths (frac{1}{2}), (frac{1}{2}). - Each subsequent break must occur on one of the largest remaining pieces. - To end up with all pieces being (frac{1}{8}), each of the final sequences of 7 breaks must correctly halve pieces into two until they have all reached the length (frac{1}{8}). 5. **Analyzing break sequences:** Each break sequence that results in all pieces being (frac{1}{8}) can be considered as follows: - Choose which piece to break, maintaining the requirement that at each step, the longest remaining piece is broken next. - After the first break, we must distribute the 6 remaining breaks such that there are exactly 3 breaks on each half of the piece. - This is combinatorially represented by the term (binom{6}{3}), because there are (binom{6}{3}) ways to choose which 3 out of 6 breaks go to one half. 6. **Choices for breaking within each half:** - Each half can be broken in any order, but since there are 3 for each half, and the sequences must respect the above constraints, we consider (2^2) choices, one for each branch of the initial split. [ text{Total favorable sequences} = binom{6}{3} = 20 ] The configuration within each half has (2 times 2 = 2^2 = 4) ways to distribute the breaks. 7. **Final probability calculation:** [ text{Probability} = frac{text{Number of Favorable Sequences}}{text{Total Number of Sequences}} = frac{20 times 4}{5040} = frac{80}{5040} = frac{1}{63} ] # Conclusion: The probability that all pieces of chalk will have lengths (frac{1}{8}) after 7 breaks is [ boxed{frac{1}{63}}. ]"},{"prompt":"w many distinct threedigit positive integers are palindromes with only even digits?","completion":"- Step 1: Identify even digits available: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

Consider the problem stating there are 10,000 children at a summer camp, each having exactly 11 friends, and every child wears a shirt of one of seven colors with the condition that any two friends wearing shirts of the same color is forbidden. 2.

We need to prove that it is still possible for at least some children amongst the remaining 9900 to change their shirt color while maintaining the original conditions. 3. Initially, we represent the friendships as an undirected graph (G), where each of the 10,000 children is a vertex and there is an edge between two vertices if the corresponding children are friends. This graph is a 11-regular graph (every vertex has degree 11). 4. By the problem's constraints, this graph (G) can be colored with 7 colors in such a way that no two adjacent vertices (friends) have the same color. 5. With 100 children unable to change their shirt color, we separate these children from the graph (G). We thus have a new graph (G') with 9900 vertices, still maintaining the 11-regular property overall. 6. To attempt a re-coloring, we can apply vertex coloring principles. Given that initially, no two friends were the same color, when we remove influence (100 fixed colors), the remaining problem reduces to re-coloring (G') with these restrictions still in place using the remaining available choices. 7. The re-coloring can be visualized using the Four Color Theorem and edge coloring properties, but ultimately the solution boils down to verifying whether there exists a correcting factor given original regular constraints in high-diameter graphs. 8. The constraining detail is ensuring adjacent nodes (friends) maintain color exclusivity. Thus, detailed calculation steps or recursive corrections, though possible to elaborate further for detailed vertex analysis, the initial rational implies non-breaking of fixed constraints due to lesser degree modifications within larger scale (10000 vertices). Thus proving: 9.

Given that the set (S = {P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n}) satisfies the conditions (no three points are collinear and no four points are concyclic), we need to establish that there exists a function (f(n)) such that (m(S) = f(n)) if and only if the points of (S) form the vertices of a convex polygon. 1. First, understand (m(S)): It is the total number of instances where a point (P_t) lies inside the circle formed by any combination of three other points (P_iP_jP_k). 2. Consider any four-element subset (S_{ijkl} = {P_i, P_j, P_k, P_l}). We can analyze the behavior of these points in terms of their geometric configurations. - If (S_{ijkl}) forms a triangle with (P_i, P_j, P_k) as its vertices, and (P_l) is inside the triangle, then the circle (P_iP_jP_k) will contain (P_l). This means one of these points is inside the circumcircle of the triangle. - If (S_{ijkl}) forms a convex quadrilateral, say (P_i, P_j, P_k, P_l), then none of the points will be inside the circle formed by any three others. As a result, in each convex quadrilateral, there will be two such configurations, one for each pair of diagonals. 3. For each four-element subset, determine (a_t) (the number of circles (P_iP_jP_k) that contain (P_t)) as follows: - If the hull is a triangle, one point lies inside the triangle's circumcircle, so (a_t = 1) for one (t) out of four points. - If the hull is a quadrilateral, each diagonal pair contributes to such configurations in the four-point set. 4. Compute (m(S)): For any set of four points, either: - The points form a convex quadrilateral resulting in (a(S) = 2) configurations. There are (a(S)) such combinations where (a_i = 1). - The points form a non-convex quadrilateral (triangle with internal point) resulting in (a(S) = 1). Therefore, there are (binom{n}{4}) four-point subsets. Each subset contributes either 1 or 2 to (m(S)). 5. Calculate the exact contribution: [ m(S) = 2a(S) + left( binom{n}{4} - a(S) right) ] Simplify to: [ m(S) = binom{n}{4} + a(S) ] 6. For (S) to be a convex polygon: - Every four points subset needs to form a convex quadrilateral. - This sets (a(S) = binom{n}{4}), so: [ m(S) = binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{4} = 2binom{n}{4} ] 7. Conversely, if (m(S) = 2binom{n}{4}), then every four-element subset must contribute 2, affirming that all subsets are convex quadrilaterals, confirming (S) is a convex polygon.

Set theta = 0 and theta = pi/4 to find x = 1 as cos (0) = 1, cos (2 times 0) = 1 and cos (pi/4) = sqrt{2}/2, cos (2 times pi/4) = 0 (undefined at theta = pi/4). Hence, the graph r = sec (2theta) is still the line x = 1 as theta varies from 0 to pi/4. 2. For r = csc (2theta) = frac{1}{sin (2theta)}, similarly, use the identity sin (2theta) = 2sin theta cos theta.

Since p is a positive even integer with a positive units digit, the possible units digits for p are 2, 4, 6, or 8 (these are the even digits). Now, we need to find a units digit of p such that when we cube p (p^3) and square p (p^2), the units digit of the result is the same. This is because we are told that the units digit of p^3 minus the units digit of p^2 is equal to 0, which means they must be the same. Let's check the units digit of p^2 and p^3 for each possible units digit of p: - If the units digit of p is 2: p^2 would end with a 4 (since 2^2 = 4). p^3 would end with an 8 (since 2^3 = 8). The units digits are different, so 2 is not the correct units digit for p. - If the units digit of p is 4: p^2 would end with a 6 (since 4^2 = 16). p^3 would end with a 4 (since 4^3 = 64). The units digits are different, so 4 is not the correct units digit for p. - If the units digit of p is 6: p^2 would end with a 6 (since 6^2 = 36). p^3 would end with a 6 (since 6^3 = 216). The units digits are the same, so 6 could be the correct units digit for p. - If the units digit of p is 8: p^2 would end with a 4 (since 8^2 = 64). p^3 would end with a 2 (since 8^3 = 512). The units digits are different, so 8 is not the correct units digit for p. Therefore, the only possible units digit for p that satisfies the condition is 6. Now, we need to find the units digit of p + 5. If the units digit of p is 6, then adding 5 to it would result in a units digit of 1 (since 6 + 5 = 11).

The problem states that it is known that the altitudes can form a triangle. Let's investigate whether the angle bisectors can also always do the same. 1. **Illustrate with Specific Triangle Properties**: Consider a triangle with the side lengths (a = 2), (b = 3), and (c < 5). These choices ensure that (c) is the longest side but still satisfies the triangle inequality. 2. **Relationship of the Altitudes**: Altitudes in a triangle are proportional to the sine of the opposite angles and the side lengths. The altitudes (h_a), (h_b), and (h_c) are given by: [ h_a = frac{2A}{a}, quad h_b = frac{2A}{b}, quad h_c = frac{2A}{c} ] where (A) is the area of the triangle. For the given sides, the ratio of the altitudes can be determined as follows: [ h_b : h_a = frac{2A}{b} : frac{2A}{a} = frac{a}{b} = frac{2}{3} ] Given (c < 5), the important critical condition will hold: [ h_c : h_a < frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, we have the inequalities: [ h_b + h_c > h_a, quad h_a + h_c > h_b, quad h_a + h_b > h_c ] This ensures that the altitudes can always form a triangle. 3. **Consideration of the Angle Bisectors**: Now, let's examine the case for the angle bisectors. When (c rightarrow 5), one of the angles becomes very small, making the corresponding angle bisector (l_c) approach zero. 4. **Calculation for the Approaching Limits**: We calculate (l_c) as follows: [ l_c to 0, quad l_c approx 3 + frac{3}{8} cdot 2 = 3.75 ] For other bisectors: [ l_b approx 2 + frac{2}{7} cdot 3 = 2.8571 approx 2frac{6}{7} ] 5. **Triangle Inequality for Angle Bisectors**: To form a triangle with the angle bisectors, the triangle inequality must be satisfied. Given the limits above, the inequalities do not hold: [ l_a + l_b > l_c, quad l_a + l_c > l_b, quad l_b + l_c > l_a ] 6. **Conclusion**: Since one of the angle bisectors approaches zero and the triangle inequality is not satisfied, it is impossible to form a triangle with the angle bisectors in this case.

To make it divisible by 11, we need to adjust this difference to the nearest multiple of 11. The nearest multiple of 11 greater than 2 is 11 itself. So, we need to add enough to the difference to make it 11: 11 - 2 = 9 Therefore, we need to add 9 to the number 11002 to make it divisible by 11. The resulting number will be: 11002 + 9 = 11011 Now, 11011 should be divisible by 11: Odd place digits: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 Even place digits: 1 + 1 = 2 The difference is now 0, which confirms that 11011 is divisible by 11. Thus, the least number to be added to 11002 to make it divisible by 11 is boxed{9} ."},{"prompt":"w many twodigit positive integers are congruent to 1 (mod 4)?","completion":"We seek integers n such that n equiv 1 pmod{4}.

This point is known as the Torricelli/Fermat point. 2. **Geometry Insight**: The geometric property related to the Torricelli point implies that the minimal sum of distances from (P) to the vertices is equal to the length of a segment ( |BC_1| ), where ( C_1 ) is the point inside the triangle such that (angle BAC_1 = 120^circ). 3. **Distance Sum**: This sum is given by the squared distance formula involving sides (a), (b), and (c) of the triangle.

First, we know that Samuel bought his ticket for 14 and spent an additional 6 on drinks and food. This means Samuel's total expenditure is 14 (ticket) + 6 (drinks and food) = 20. 2. Kevin also bought a ticket and spent money on drinks. The cost of Kevin's ticket is the same as Samuel's, which is 14. Kevin then spends 2 on drinks. Therefore, Kevin's total spending on the ticket and drinks is 14 (ticket) + 2 (drinks) = 16. 3. Since Kevin used his entire budget of 20, we can calculate the amount he spent on food by subtracting the amount he spent on his ticket and drinks from his total budget.

We denote the sets of these scenarios by ( B_{0}, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3} ). 1. **No Empty Boxes (( B_{0} ))**: - We can use the principle of combinatorial selection to determine how to distribute the balls such that no box is empty. - The number of ways to place ( k ) balls into ( n ) boxes where no box is empty is given by the Stirling numbers of the second kind, ( S(k, n) ), multiplied by ( n! ) since the boxes are distinguishable.

The number of regions formed by n lines can be found using the formula: Number of regions = 1 + n + (n choose 2) Where \\"n choose 2\\" is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose 2 lines from n lines, which is calculated as: n choose 2 = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!)

For any six cells of the same color arranged in a single row, it is given that there are no cells of the same color above the leftmost one or below the rightmost one. We need to determine the smallest possible (n). 1. Consider one specific color, let's say blue. 2. Identify the leftmost five blue cells in each row, marking these cells with a cross and marking any remaining cells (if fewer than six blue cells are present in a row, mark all of them). 3. Realize that in each column, there is at most one blue cell marked with a naught (since otherwise, the condition specified in the problem would be violated for the top cell among the marked ones). 4. Thus, the maximum number of blue cells marked with a naught is at most (2023). Now, denote the total number of blue cells marked with a cross as (5 times 2023) because in each row, there are at most five such cells. 5. Hence, the total number of blue cells is bounded by: [ 2023 + 5 times 2023 = 6 times 2023 ] 6. This argument holds true for any color.

In other words, ( gcd(a, b, c) = 1 ). Suppose ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3k(ab + bc + ca) ) for some integer ( k ). 2. **Equal Multiples**: We can rewrite the given relationship by multiplying both sides by ( 3k + 2 ): [ (3k + 2)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 3k(a + b + c)^2 ] 3. **Prime Factor Analysis**: Notice that ( 3k + 2 equiv 2 pmod{3} ). This implies that there is a prime ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ) with ( nu_p(3k + 2) ) being odd (where ( nu_p(n) ) denotes the exponent of ( p ) in the prime factorization of ( n )). Given ( 3k + 2 ), we deduce: - ( nu_p(3k + 2) ) is odd and ( p mid 3k + 2 ). 4. **Case Analysis for ( p = 2 )**: - Suppose ( p = 2 ) and ( nu_2(3k + 2) ) is odd.

Therefore: [ 1 + nu_2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = nu_2(3k + 2) + nu_2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ] Equality cannot occur due to ( nu_2(a + b + c) = 0 ) and ( nu_2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 1 ) being impossible simultaneously. - **Case 2**: ( nu_2(k) = 1 ): Here, ( nu_2(3k + 2) ) is odd and greater than 1. Now: [ nu_2(3k + 2) + nu_2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 1 + 2nu_2(a + b + c) ] Therefore, ( nu_2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ) must be even, implying ( nu_2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 0 ) and thus ( nu_2(a + b + c) = 0 ). This leads to a contradiction since ( 1 < nu_2(3k + 2) ). 6. **Prime ( p neq 2 ) Argument**: - Observe that ( p mid a + b + c ) and ( p mid a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ). - Without loss of generality, assume ( b notequiv 0 pmod{p} ), then: [ a^2 + b^2 + (a + b)^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} Longrightarrow a^2 + ab + b^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] - Let ( x = ab^{-1} ): [ x^2 + x + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] This expression is the third cyclotomic polynomial and implies ( p = 3 ) or ( 3 mid p - 1 ).

Considering the octagon UVWXYZAB, and focusing on triangle UWY, where U, W, and Y are consecutive vertices (assuming clockwise order of vertices starting from U), the triangle is isosceles as overline{WY} and overline{WU} are sides of the regular octagon. For the isosceles triangle UWY, the vertex angle at W corresponds to one of the interior angles of the octagon, so angle UWY = 135^circ.

Given that e = frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, we have a = sqrt{3}. Since b^2 = a^2(1-e^2), we obtain b^2 = 2. Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse is frac{x^{2}}{3} + frac{y^{2}}{2} = 1. (II) (i) When the slope k of line BD exists and k neq 0, the equation of line BD is y = k(x+1).

To determine the maximum value of n such that any set of 50 different numbers chosen from ( {1, 2, cdots, n} ) contains two numbers with a difference of 7, we employ the **Pigeonhole Principle**. 2. Since ( 50 = 7 cdot 7 + 1 ), according to the Pigeonhole Principle, if we partition the set ( {1, 2, cdots, n} ) into 7 equal parts, and then choose 50 numbers from ( n ), at least one of these parts must contain at least 8 numbers, ensuring that within this part there must be at least two numbers that differ by 7. 3. Now, let’s consider ( n = 98 ): - From 1 to 98, we can split these numbers into 14 groups, each containing 7 consecutive numbers. These groups are grouped as follows: - Group 1: ( {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} ) - Group 2: ( {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14} ) - ... - Group 14: ( {92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98} ) 4. If we pick 50 numbers out of these 98, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these groups must contain at least 8 numbers. Since each group initially contains numbers differing by 1, this guarantees that there exists two numbers whose difference is exactly 7 (e.g., (14 = 7+7)) within that group. 5. Now, consider ( n = 99 ): - Suppose we pick the following 50 numbers from 1 to 99: [ begin{array}{l} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 99. end{array} ] - These subsets avoid any two numbers having a difference of 7. For instance, between numbers in separate groups: - Differences like ( 15 - 1 = 14 ), ( 29 - 15 = 14 ), etc. and do not result in a difference of 7. This illustrates that a set of 50 numbers from 1 to 99 can avoid every difference being equal to 7. 6. Therefore, in ( 1,2, cdots, 99 ), it's possible to select 50 numbers such that no two numbers differ by 7. 7.

For ( x + y ) to be a root of unity, it must lie on the unit circle, thus its magnitude should also be 1: [ |x + y| = 1 ] 4. **Geometric Equivalence:** Consider the geometric representation.

We use the series expansion for (frac{1}{5^n+1}): [ frac{1}{5^n+1} = sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} frac{1}{5^{mn}} ] Therefore, we can rewrite the original series as: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{phi(n)}{5^n+1} = sum_{n=1}^{infty} phi(n) sum_{m=1}^{infty} (-1)^{m+1} frac{1}{5^{mn}} ] 3.

What fraction of the large group of turtles jumped off the log and ran away?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Initially, there are 9 turtles on the log. 2. Then, two less than three times the original number of turtles climb onto the log. Three times the original number would be 3 * 9 = 27 turtles. Two less than that would be 27 - 2 = 25 turtles. 3. These 25 turtles join the original 9 on the log, making the new total number of turtles on the log 9 + 25 = 34 turtles. 4. After some turtles are frightened and jump off, there are 17 turtles remaining on the log. To find out how many turtles jumped off, we subtract the number of turtles remaining from the total number that were on the log before they were frightened: 34 (total number on the log) - 17 (remaining on the log) = 17 turtles jumped off. Now, to find the fraction of the large group that jumped off, we take the number that jumped off and divide it by the total number that were on the log before any jumped off: 17 (jumped off) / 34 (total before jumping off) = 1/2.

To find the function relationship between y and x, we start by assuming the relationship is linear, so we can express it as y = kx + b. Given two points from the table, (3.5, 280) and (5.5, 120), we can substitute these into the equation to form a system of equations: [ begin{cases} 3.5k + b = 280 5.5k + b = 120 end{cases} ] Subtracting the first equation from the second gives 2k = -160, leading to k = -80. Substituting k = -80 into the first equation yields 3.5(-80) + b = 280, which simplifies to -280 + b = 280, thus b = 560. Therefore, the function relationship between y and x is y = -80x + 560. 2. To find the selling price that results in a profit of 160 dollars per day, we use the profit formula, which is the total revenue minus the cost of goods sold (COGS) and other expenses. The COGS is (x-3)y (since each bag costs 3 to purchase), and the other expenses are 80 dollars per day. The total revenue is xy. Thus, the profit equation is: [ (x-3)(-80x + 560) - 80 = 160 ] Expanding and simplifying gives: [ -80x^2 + 800x - 1760 - 80 = 160 ] Further simplifying, we get: [ -80x^2 + 800x - 1920 = 0 ] Dividing by -80 gives: [ x^2 - 10x + 24 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find x_1 = 4 and x_2 = 6.

Consider a natural number ( N ) with digits ( a_n, a_{n-1}, ldots, a_1 ). The number can be expressed as: [ N = a_n cdot 10^{n-1} + a_{n-1} cdot 10^{n-2} + cdots + a_1 ] 2. Now, let’s consider the reverse of the number ( N ), which is denoted as ( N' ), expressed as: [ N' = a_1 cdot 10^{n-1} + a_2 cdot 10^{n-2} + cdots + a_n ] 3. We need to find the difference between ( N ) and its reverse ( N' ): [ N - N' = (a_n cdot 10^{n-1} + a_{n-1} cdot 10^{n-2} + cdots + a_1) - (a_1 cdot 10^{n-1} + a_2 cdot 10^{n-2} + cdots + a_n) ] 4.

This indicates we are dealing with a spherical surface confined to the first octant of the 3D coordinate system. 2. **Area of Individual Surfaces**: We need to consider the three flat faces of the eighth-sphere. Each of these is a quarter-circle of radius 1 (since the radius of the sphere is 1). The area of one quarter of a circle is given by: [ text{Area of one quarter-circle} = frac{pi times (1)^2}{4} = frac{pi}{4} ] 3. **Projection and Overlap**: Next, we learn that the projection of these faces onto the plane (x + y + z = 1) covers the desired area without overlap. Therefore, our task is to find the total area of these projections. 4. **Calculating the Projection Factor**: To find how these areas are scaled during projection, we must calculate the cosine of the angle ((theta)) between the plane (z = 0) (a general plane containing one of the quarter-circles) and the plane (x + y + z = 1). The normal vector to the plane (z = 0) is ((0,0,1)). The normal vector to the plane (x + y + z = 1) is ((1,1,1)). Using the dot product formula for the cosine of the angle between two vectors: [ cos theta = frac{(0, 0, 1) cdot (1, 1, 1)}{|(0, 0, 1)| |(1, 1, 1)|} = frac{0 cdot 1 + 0 cdot 1 + 1 cdot 1}{sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] 5. **Applying the Projection Factor**: The area of each of the quarter-circle faces is scaled by a factor of (frac{1}{sqrt{3}}) during projection.

To find the total number of pieces Robin has, we add these 7 pieces to the total pieces of candy: Total pieces Robin has = Total pieces of candy + Additional pieces Total pieces Robin has = 84 + 7 Total pieces Robin has = 91 pieces Since we are looking for the number of packages of gum Robin has, and we know that each package contains 6 pieces, we can divide the total number of pieces Robin has by the number of pieces per package to find the number of packages of gum: Number of packages of gum = Total pieces Robin has ÷ Number of pieces per package Number of packages of gum = 91 ÷ 6 When we divide 91 by 6, we get 15 with a remainder of 1. This means that Robin has 15 full packages of gum and 1 extra piece that is not part of a package. Since we are only looking for the number of full packages of gum, the answer is boxed{15} packages of gum."},{"prompt":"For planes M and N, the following conditions are given: 1.

By definition of the power of a point: [ P_{omega}(A) = AO^2 - R^2 quad text{and} quad P_{omega}(B) = BO^2 - R^2 ] Using the formula for the length of the median in a triangle: [ MO^2 = frac{2AO^2 + 2BO^2 - AB^2}{4} ] Then we have: [ P_{omega}(M) = MO^2 - R^2 = frac{2P_{omega}(A) + 2P_{omega}(B) - AB^2}{4} ] 4. **Application of Lemma to Problem**: Using the lemma for power computations on medians (AM_a) and (BM_b): For circle (omega_a) and point (M_c): [ P_{omega_a}(M_c) = frac{2P_{omega_a}(A) + 2P_{omega_a}(B) - AB^2}{4} ] Similarly, for circle (omega_b) and point (M_c): [ P_{omega_b}(M_c) = frac{2P_{omega_b}(A) + 2P_{omega_b}(B) - AB^2}{4} ] 5. **Simplifying Substitutions and Calculations**: For circle (omega_a), let's substitute the given relationships: [ P_{omega_a}(A) = AM_a^2 quad text{and} quad P_{omega_a}(B) = A P cdot AM_a ] where for median: [ AM_a^2 = frac{2(BM_a^2 + CM_a^2) - BC^2}{4} ] Rewriting the power of (M_c) with circle (omega_a): [ P_{omega_a}(M_c) = frac{ left(frac{2}{3}a^2 + frac{2m_a^2}{3} - c^2 right)}{4} = frac{a^2 + b^2 - 2c^2}{12} ] Similarly, for circle (omega_b): [ P_{omega_b}(A) = A M_b^2 quad text{and} quad P_{omega_b}(B) = BQ cdot BM_b ] where for median: [ BM_b^2 = frac{2(AM_b^2 + CM_b^2) - CA^2}{4} ] Rewriting the power of (M_c) with circle (omega_b): [ P_{omega_b}(M_c) = frac{ left(frac{2}{3}b^2 + frac{2m_b^2}{3} - c^2right)}{4} = frac{a^2 + b^2 - 2c^2}{12} ] 6. **Conclusion**: Since (P_{omega_a}(M_c) = P_{omega_b}(M_c)), (M_c) lies on the radical axis of (omega_a) and (omega_b), which implies that point (M_c) is collinear with the intersection points (X) and (Y) of circles (omega_a) and (omega_b).

We need to prove that AA_{2} perp KC. To start, let's extend the median AA_{1} to form parallelogram ABCD. Note that in parallelogram ABCD, D is such that AD and BC are equal and parallel. 3. Recall the properties of the angle bisector in triangle ABC: [ frac{A_{2}B}{A_{2}C} = frac{AB}{AC} ] 4. By the Generalized Thales' Theorem, if a line is parallel to one side of a triangle and it intersects the other two sides proportionally, then this line divides those sides proportionally. Applying this to K which is on line AD: [ frac{KD}{KA} = frac{A_{2}B}{A_{2}C} = frac{AB}{AC} = frac{CD}{AC} ] 5. From the properties of the angle bisector that we mentioned earlier, and knowing that KA_{2} parallel AC, we have that point K divides AD in the same ratios: [ frac{KD}{KA} = frac{CD}{AC} ] 6.

Show that all the polygons in the sequence have an area greater than ( frac{1}{3} ).","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to show that all polygons in the sequence have an area greater than ( frac{1}{3} ). Here's a detailed step-by-step proof: 1. **Initial Polygon**: - The initial polygon is a regular hexagon with area 1. 2. **Convexity**: - Each subsequent polygon remains convex. This is because each new polygon is formed by cutting off a corner and joining the adjacent edge midpoints, which continues to preserve convexity. 3. **Vertex Retention**: - It is crucial to note that each polygon in the sequence retains a vertex on each of the sides of the original hexagon. Hence, no side of the hexagon can be completely eliminated. 4. **Vertices Position**: - Let the original hexagon be labeled ( ABCDEF ). The midpoints of the sides are joined, and we consider the intersections of these segments to form a smaller hexagon. Specifically, the intersection points ( U, V, W, X, Y, Z ) form within the hexagon ( ABCDEF ). 5. **Intersection of Diagonals**: - The diagonals ( AC, BD, CE, DF, EA, FB ) from the original hexagon form the vertices of the inner hexagon ( UVWXYZ ). For example, point ( U ) is the intersection of diagonals ( AC ) and ( FB ). 6. **Segment Intersections**: - In any polygon from the sequence, vertices on segments like ( AB ) and ( BC ) must include the segment joining these two. This segment will always intersect portions of the diagonals such as ( BU ) and ( BV ), ensuring certain points on ( BU ) and ( BV ) are part of the polygon. 7. **Convex Hull**: - The points on segments ( BU, BV, CW, ) etc., guarantee that the convex hull of these points includes the inner hexagon ( UVWXYZ ). 8. **Area Calculation**: - We need to prove the area of ( UVWXYZ ) is ( frac{1}{3} ) of the area of ( ABCDEF ): - Recall that the triangle ( ABF ) in the hexagon is isosceles with an angle ( angle ABF = 30^circ ). - If ( AB = k ), then ( BF = ksqrt{3} ). - The segment ( BU ) equals ( frac{k}{sqrt{3}} ) because ( U ) is the midpoint of segment ( BF ). - Therefore, the distance ( UZ ) (a side of the inner hexagon) is given by ( ksqrt{3} - 2 cdot frac{k}{sqrt{3}} = frac{k}{sqrt{3}} ). 9. **Area Relation**: - Since each smaller hexagon maintains the ratio ( frac{1}{3} ) of the area of its predecessor due to the property of the side lengths and the constructed geometry, the area of hexagon ( UVWXYZ ) is ( frac{1}{3} ) the area of ( ABCDEF ). 10. **Conclusion**: - Given that the area of ( ABCDEF ) is 1, the area of ( UVWXYZ ) is ( frac{1}{3} ).

Without loss of generality, assume the bottom side of the square contains two vertices of the pentagon. - This leaves the other three vertices on the remaining three sides of the square. 3. **Symmetry and Spatial Constraints:** - A regular pentagon inscribed in such a square would imply symmetry. Imagine the vertical line through the top vertex—this should be the axis of symmetry. - For the resulting figure to form a regular pentagon, the height (which spans from the top to the bottom of the square) must equal the width, aligning with the properties of the pentagon's diagonals. Hence, one diagonal of the pentagon equals the side length of the square. 4. **Incompatibility with Diagonal Length:** - The height of the square is 1, while the diagonal of a pentagon is given by the length d = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}. - Clearly, d > 1, which makes it impossible to fit a regular pentagon with all sides lying on the same face of the cube. 5. **Considering Separate Faces:** - If no two consecutive vertices lie on the same face, each side of the pentagon must lie on a different face. - The cube has six faces, and there are four pairs of parallel faces. Thus, we examine the configuration: - With five sides adhering to distinct planes, two sides must inevitably be parallel. - Since pentagon's internal angles and symmetry are based on 2pi / 5, sides being parallel contradicts the fixed angle requirements. 6. **Vertices on Edges and Center of Measurement:** - Not all vertices align when each edge lies on separate faces, and verifying the height of pentagon sides extends beyond single unit length. - Recognizing that a regular pentagon exceeds these square constraints further corroborates the infeasibility. # Conclusion: Thus, it is geometrically impossible for any regular pentagon to have its five vertices situated purely along the edges of a cube, considering existing contradictions with distances, angles, and the pigeonhole principle.

Let's denote the length of the third side as n. We have two sides with lengths 5 and 7 units. Applying the triangle inequality theorem, we get three inequalities: 1. The sum of the third side and the side of length 5 must be greater than the side of length 7: [n + 5 > 7] Simplifying this inequality, we find: [n > 2] 2. The sum of the third side and the side of length 7 must be greater than the side of length 5: [n + 7 > 5] Simplifying this inequality, we find: [n > -2] However, since the length of a side of a triangle cannot be negative, the condition n > -2 is always true given n is a positive integer. 3. The sum of the two known sides must be greater than the third side: [5 + 7 > n] Simplifying this inequality, we find: [12 > n] Or equivalently: [n < 12] Combining these inequalities, we find that n must be greater than 2 and less than 12. Therefore, the possible integer lengths for the third side are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Counting these, we find there are a total of 9 possible integer lengths for the third side.

Since the angles opposite these sides in a triangle will follow the same order due to the property that larger sides are opposite larger angles (law of triangle inequality), we have (A geq B geq C). 2. **Form the inequality using the arrangement of sides and angles:** Consider the inequality: [ (a-b)(A-B) + (b-c)(B-C) + (c-a)(C-A) geq 0 ] Notice that each term on the LHS contains a subtraction of two sides multiplied by a subtraction of the corresponding angles. Since (a geq b geq c) and (A geq B geq C), each term of the form ((x-y)(X-Y) geq 0). 3. **Expand the product terms:** We can rewrite and expand the inequality as follows: [ (a-b)(A-B) + (b-c)(B-C) + (c-a)(C-A) geq 0 ] Expanding these products, we obtain: [ aA - aB - bA + bB + bB - bC - cB + cC + cC - cA - aC + aA geq 0 ] Simplify the terms: [ 2aA + 2bB + 2cC - (aB + bA + bC + cB + cA + aC) geq 0 ] 4. **Simplify the expanded inequality:** Combine like terms: [ 2(aA + bB + cC) geq aB + bA + bC + cB + cA + aC ] 5. **Divide both sides by 2:** To simplify to the original form, divide the entire inequality by 2: [ aA + bB + cC geq frac{1}{2}(aB + bA + bC + cB + cA + aC) ] 6. **Conclusion of equality condition:** For the inequality to turn into equality, each term ((x-y)(X-Y) = 0) must hold true.

The cost is 500 yuan per machine, so the total cost is 500(12-x) yuan. - From city B to city C: Since city C needs 10 machines in total and x of them come from city A, 10-x machines must come from city B. The cost is 400 yuan per machine, so the total cost is 400(10-x) yuan. - From city B to city D: Since city D also needs 10 machines and 12-x are sent from city A, x-2 machines must come from city B to make up the total. The cost is 800 yuan per machine, so the total cost is 800(x-2) yuan. Adding these costs together gives the total transportation cost W: [ W = 300x + 500(12-x) + 400(10-x) + 800(x-2) ] Simplifying this expression: [ W = 300x + 6000 - 500x + 4000 - 400x + 800x - 1600 ] [ W = 200x + 8400 ] Therefore, the function relationship of the total transportation cost y in terms of x is y = 200x + 8400. Part 2: Determining the Range of Values for x The constraints on x come from the number of machines available and the requirement that all cities receive the correct number of machines: - x geq 0 because at least 0 machines can be sent from city A to city C. - 12 - x geq 0 to ensure city A has enough machines to send to city D. - 10 - x geq 0 to ensure city B can fulfill the requirement for city C. - x - 2 geq 0 to ensure city B can send at least 2 machines to city D.

Substituting x = 2 into the cost function: [ W = 200(2) + 8400 = 400 + 8400 = 8800 ] Therefore, the minimum total transportation cost is 8800 yuan. The transportation plan at this minimum cost involves: - Sending 2 machines from city A to city C. - Sending 10 machines from city A to city D. - Sending 8 machines from city B to city C. - Sending 0 machines from city B to city D.

It remains to prove that any point O of this octagon, except midpoints of the sides of the square, belongs to the GMT. 8. If O lies on a median line parallel to AB and the distance from it to AD does not exceed the distance to BC, then X and Y as the projections of O on AB and CD respectively, and any point Z on BC will satisfy the conditions. 9. If O lies in the quarter of the square containing A, between the parabola with focus A and the corresponding median line, then X and Y can be the second points of intersection of circle O with radius OA, and Z can be a point of intersection of this circle with BC. # Conclusion: All points of the curvilinear octagon, bounded by the arcs of eight parabolas with foci at the vertices of the square and directrices containing the non-adjacent sides (excluding midpoints of the sides of the square) form the geometric mean time (GMT) where the midpoints of the hypotenuses of right-angled triangles lie.

Thus, operations preserve the odd versus even numbers of +1/-1 status. Conclusion.

Since the vertex lies in the center of the interval (m, m+6), we have x_v = m + 3. 3. From the two equations above, we have -frac{a}{2} = m + 3. Therefore, m = -frac{a}{2} - 3. 4. We are given that the solution set for f(x) < c is (m, m+6), and at the endpoints of this interval f(x) = c. 5. Therefore, c = f(m) = f(-frac{a}{2} - 3). 6. Substituting x with m in the function f(x), we get f(m) = (frac{-a}{2} - 3)^2 + a(frac{-a}{2} - 3) + b. 7. Expanding this, we get f(m) = frac{a^2}{4} + 3a + 9 - frac{a^2}{2} - 3a + b. 8. Simplify the expression to find c: c = f(m) = frac{a^2}{4} - frac{a^2}{2} + 9 + b. 9. Since f(x) has a minimum value at 0 (the start of its range), b must be 0 when x= x_v = -frac{a}{2}. 10. This gives us -frac{a^2}{4} + b = 0, and substituting this into the equation for c, we have c = 0 + 9 = 9. Therefore, the value of the real number c is boxed{9}."},{"prompt":"On Monday, Millie puts a quart of seeds, 25% of which are millet, into a bird feeder.

Determine the equation of circle O. 2. Given a point P(2, 3), draw a tangent line to circle O passing through P. Find the equation of the tangent line.","completion":"1. The distance ( d ) from the center of the circle to the given line can be computed using the formula d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} where ( Ax + By + C = 0 ) is the equation of the line and ( (x_0, y_0) ) is the point from which we measure the distance. For the line ( x - sqrt{3}y - 4 = 0 ) and the point ( (0, 0) ), this becomes d = frac{|1 cdot 0 - sqrt{3} cdot 0 - 4|}{sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2}} = frac{4}{2} = 2. This distance is, in fact, the radius of our circle, since the line is tangent to the circle at one point meaning the radius extends perpendicularly to the tangent line at the point of tangency. Therefore, the equation for circle O with radius ( r = 2 ) is x^2 + y^2 = r^2 which gives us x^2 + y^2 = 4. The boxed equation of circle O is boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 4}. 2. To find the equation of the tangent line through point P(2, 3), we will consider two cases: - **When the slope is undefined**: This is the case for a vertical tangent line. Since P(2, 3) lies on this vertical line, and the x-coordinate of P is 2, the equation of this vertical line is boxed{x = 2}. - **When the slope exists**: Let ( k ) be the slope of the tangent line through P(2, 3). The point-slope form of the line is y - 3 = k(x - 2). Rewriting this in standard form yields kx - y - 2k + 3 = 0. We can again use the distance formula for the distance ( d ) from the center of the circle (0,0) to this line: d = frac{|-2k + 3|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 2. Since the distance must equal the radius of the circle, we square both sides to remove the absolute value and solve for ( k ): (-2k + 3)^2 = (2sqrt{k^2 + 1})^2 4k^2 - 12k + 9 = 4(k^2 + 1) 4k^2 - 12k + 9 = 4k^2 + 4 -12k + 9 = 4 -12k = -5 k = frac{5}{12}. Substituting ( k ) back into the line equation we get the tangent line: frac{5}{12}x - y - 2left(frac{5}{12}right) + 3 = 0 Simplifying this we obtain 5x - 12y + 26 = 0. Thus, the boxed equation of the tangent line when the slope exists is boxed{5x - 12y + 26 = 0}.

Therefore, f(x) is decreasing on (0, frac{1}{2}) and increasing on (frac{1}{2}, +infty). ii) For 0 < a < frac{1}{2}: If f'(x) > 0, then x > frac{1}{2} or 0 < x < a. If f'(x) < 0, then a < x < frac{1}{2}. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (0, a) and (frac{1}{2}, +infty), and decreasing on (a, frac{1}{2}). iii) For a = frac{1}{2}: The derivative f'(x) geq 0 for all x, hence f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). iv) For a > frac{1}{2}: If f'(x) > 0, then 0 < x < frac{1}{2} or x > a. If f'(x) < 0, then frac{1}{2} < x < a. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{2}) and (a, +infty), and decreasing on (frac{1}{2}, a). (3) From part (2): i) For a leq 0: Since f(x) is increasing on (frac{1}{2}, +infty), it follows that f(x) is increasing on (1, +infty). So, for x > 1, we have f(x) > f(1) = -2a geq 0. ii) For 0 < a leq frac{1}{2}: Since f(x) is increasing on (frac{1}{2}, +infty), it follows that f(x) is increasing on (1, +infty).

Note: (x,y) is an integer point if and only if x and y are both integers. *Proposed by CSJL*","completion":"1. **Define Lattice Triangles**: A lattice triangle is a triangle whose vertices are at lattice points (integer coordinates). 2. **Claim**: There are (2^n - 1) distinct (up to congruence) lattice triangles with area (2^n). This implies that the answer to our problem is (boxed{2^{2020} - 1}). 3. **Induction Basis**: We will show this by induction on (n). Before doing so, we need a few lemmas. 4. **Lemma 1**: Consider a lattice triangle (triangle ABC) such that the midpoint of (BC) is (M_a), that of (CA) is (M_b), and that of (AB) is (M_c). At least one of (M_a, M_b, M_c) is a lattice point. **Proof**: Suppose the contrary, for contradiction. By some simple parity checking, we can assume WLOG that (overrightarrow{AB} = (2 x_b + 1, 2 y_b)) and (overrightarrow{AC} = (2x_c +1 , 2y_c)) for some integers (x_b, x_c, y_b, y_c). But then it's easily verified that (|AB times AC|) is odd and therefore (triangle ABC) has non-integral area, contradiction. So our assumption was wrong and the lemma holds. (blacksquare) 5. **Medial Triangle Observation**: It's also clear from Lemma 1 that the medial triangle of any acute lattice triangle with area a power of two has either one or three vertices at lattice points. Call triangles of the former kind **tangy** and those of the latter kind **wangy**. 6. **Lemma 2**: There are precisely (n) acute isosceles lattice triangles with area (2^n), for all nonnegative (n). **Proof**: Omitted. (blacksquare) 7. **Define Sets and Functions**: Let (S_n) denote the set of acute scalene lattice triangles of area (2^n) and let (f(n) = |S_n|), for all nonnegative integers (n). 8. **Induction Hypothesis**: We claim that (f(n) = 2^n - n - 1) for all (n in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0}), which yields the desired result when combined with Lemma 2. It's easy to check that this holds for (n = 0, 1) by hand. 9. **Induction Step**: To show that (f(n) = 2^n - n - 1), it would suffice by induction to show that (f(n) = 3 cdot f(n-1) - 2 cdot f(n-2) + 1) for (n ge 2), which is precisely what we shall show. 10. **Bijection Observation**: Observe that there is a bijection between wangy triangles in (S_n) and triangles in (S_{n-2}) by simply considering the medial triangles of wangy triangles in (S_n). 11. **Define Augmentation**: For a triangle, we define an **augmentation** of it to be the triangle formed when we take two of its vertices (P) and (Q), and move (Q) to the point (Q') satisfying (overrightarrow{PQ'} = 2 overrightarrow{PQ}). In this way, a triangle has up to six different augmentations. 12. **Augmentation Properties**: Observe that any triangle in (S_{n-1}) has precisely 3 augmentations which are acute. Furthermore, it's easy to check that any isosceles lattice triangle with area (2^{n-1}) has precisely one augmentation. 13. **Tangy and Wangy Augmentations**: Any tangy triangle in (S_n) is the augmentation of precisely one acute lattice triangle of area (2^{n-1}), while the wangy triangles in (S_n) are the augmentations of three acute lattice triangles of area (2^{n-1}). 14. **Isosceles Augmentations**: It's easy to check that precisely (n-2) augmentations of acute lattice triangles with area (2^{n-1}) are isosceles acute lattice triangles. 15. **Equation Setup**: Hence, if we let (x) denote the number of augmentations of acute lattice triangles in (S_{n-1}) (with multiplicity) and (y) be the number of wangy triangles in (S_n), we can use the previous results to arrive at: [ f(n) + n-2 = x - 2y. qquad (1) ] 16. **Calculate (x)**: From previous results, it's also easy to see that (x = 3 cdot f(n-1) + n-1). 17. **Calculate (y)**: Now, we can observe that the triangles in (S_{n-2}) are simply the medial triangles of the wangy triangles of (S_n), implying that (y = f(n-2)). 18. **Final Equation**: Hence, (1) can now be rewritten as: [ f(n) + n-2 = 3f(n-1) + n-1 - 2f(n-2) Leftrightarrow f(n) = 3f(n-1) -2f(n-2) + 1, ] as desired.

Prove that at least one number occurs in the table: a) no less than [n / 2] times (where [a] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to a); b) no less than n times.","completion":"Given a square table with dimensions ( n times n ) filled with integers, such that any two numbers in adjacent cells differ by at most 1, we need to prove the following two parts: 1. At least one number appears not less than (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor) times. 2. At least one number appears not less than (n) times. We’ll address part (b) here: Let ( m_{k} ) and ( M_{k} ) denote the smallest and largest numbers, respectively, in the (k)-th column of the table. **Step-by-step solution:** 1. Consider the numbers in any column ( k ). We note that since any two adjacent cells differ by at most 1, the range ([m_k, M_k]) must necessarily include all integers in between. 2. This means, for any ( x ) where ( m_k leq x leq M_k ), the number ( x ) will appear at least once in the (k)-th column. 3. We denote that the ranges of each column ( k ) overlap to some extent given the constraints (any two adjacent cells differ by at most 1). Therefore, there must be at least one integer ( x ) that is common within the range ([m_k, M_k]) across all columns. 4. If such an integer ( x ) exists such that ( m_k leq x leq M_k ) for all ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ), then this integer appears in every column. Since there are ( n ) columns, it appears at least ( n ) times. 5. If instead for all columns, we have ( M_{k} geq m_{k} ) such that there exists some sequences ( (m_k, m_p) ) and ( (M_k, M_p) ) where ( M_{k} geq m_{k} > M_{p} geq m_{p} ) for any combination of columns ( k ) and ( p ), then the values across rows will overlap to ensure that at least one number spans across all rows. 6. Therefore, given that every number ( x ) must satisfy the constraint of differentiating by at most 1 with their neighbors, there will be at least one number ( y ) such that it will appear in each row at least once. Thus, we see that in the arrangement of ( n times n ) table with given constraints, at least one number must appear at least ( n ) times. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{At least one number appears not less than } n text{ times.}} ]"},{"prompt":"A twodigit integer AB equals frac{1}{8} of the threedigit integer AAB, where A and B are digits from 1 to 9.

The least common multiple (l.c.m.) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. Since the h.c.f. of A and B is 20, we can express the l.c.m. of A and B as: l.c.m.(A, B) = 20 * x * 14 where x is the other factor of the l.c.m. that we need to find.
