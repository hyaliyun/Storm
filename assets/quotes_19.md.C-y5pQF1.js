Since drivers drive 800 feet at 10 feet/second, the time to drive between floors is: 800 feet / 10 feet/second = 80 seconds Now, let's consider the time it takes to show ID at every 3rd floor. Since it takes 2 minutes (which is 120 seconds) to show ID, and this happens every 3rd floor, we need to add this time to the total time it takes to get to the bottom of the garage. Let's denote the number of floors as F. Since drivers have to show ID every 3rd floor, the number of ID checks will be (F - 1) / 3, because the top floor does not require an ID check when leaving. The total time to get to the bottom of the garage is the sum of the driving time between all floors and the time spent on ID checks. We know the total time is 1440 seconds, so we can set up the following equation: Driving time between floors + Time spent on ID checks = Total time 80(F - 1) + 120((F - 1) / 3) = 1440 Now, let's solve for F: 80F - 80 + 40(F - 1) = 1440 80F + 40F - 40 - 80 = 1440 120F - 120 = 1440 120F = 1440 + 120 120F = 1560 F = 1560 / 120 F = 13 Therefore, the parking garage has boxed{13} floors."},{"prompt":"Let ABC be an acute triangle with orthocenter H.

To solve the problem, it is necessary to analyze the given options regarding the geometric properties of the three-dimensional figure depicted in diagram 1. Diagrams that usually accompany such problems depict the geometric body in question for further reference. 2. The problem implies the consideration of specific properties of the geometric solid such as the radius of the circumscribed sphere (Option A), volume (Option B), surface area (Option C), and surface area of the circumscribed sphere (Option D). Here, we need to evaluate each of these properties. 3. Let us evaluate each option step by step. Option (A): The radius of the circumscribed sphere is frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. 4. Given that the geometric body is a regular polyhedron with a regular triangular base (as implied in the problem), let’s consider it to be a regular tetrahedron, which is the most common three-dimensional figure with a triangular base. 5. The formula for the radius ( R ) of the circumscribed sphere of a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( a ) is: [ R = dfrac{a sqrt{6}}{4} ] 6. Rewriting the formula, [ R = dfrac{a sqrt{6}}{4} = a cdot dfrac{sqrt{6}}{4} ] 7. Setting ( a = 1 ), [ R = dfrac{sqrt{6}}{4} ] 8. However, the options provided state ( R = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3} ). 9. Comparing both, we need to verify if: [ dfrac{sqrt{3}}{3} = dfrac{sqrt{6}}{4} ] 10.

The volume ( V ) of a regular tetrahedron with edge length ( a ) is: [ V = dfrac{a^3}{6sqrt{2}} ] 13. Setting ( a = 1 ), [ V = dfrac{1^3}{6 sqrt{2}} = dfrac{1}{6 sqrt{2}} = dfrac{sqrt{2}}{12} ] However, the options provided state ( V = sqrt{3} ). 14.

Setting ( a = 1 ), [ A = sqrt{3} cdot 1^2 = sqrt{3} ] 19. The options provided state ( A = sqrt{6} + sqrt{3} + 1 ), [ sqrt{3} ne sqrt{6} + sqrt{3} + 1 ] Simplifying verifies if they are not equal. 20. Thus, option C does not hold true. Option (D): Surface area of the circumscribed sphere is frac{16 pi}{3} 21. The surface area ( S ) of a sphere with radius ( R ) is given by: [ S = 4 pi R^2 ] 22. Recall from the previous examination of Option A where the radius ( R ) of the circumscribed sphere for measurement was: [ R = dfrac{a sqrt{6}}{4} ] 23.

D: If P(A) > 0, P(B) > 0, then Events A and B are independent and Events A and B are mutually exclusive cannot both be true.","completion":"For option A, let's examine the concepts of mutually exclusive and complementary events. If events A and B are mutually exclusive, it means they cannot happen at the same time. Being complementary, on the other hand, means that one happens if and only if the other does not, covering all possible outcomes together. While mutually exclusive events can be complementary if they cover all outcomes between them, not all mutually exclusive events are complementary as they may not cover all outcomes. Conversely, complementary events must be mutually exclusive but not all mutually exclusive events are complementary. Thus, the statement that \\"Events A and B are mutually exclusive\\" is a necessary condition for them to be complementary, not sufficient. Hence, option A is incorrect. For option B, let's consider the independence of events A (Odd number on the first roll) and B (Even number on the second roll). Independence means the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. The result of the first dice roll (odd or even) does not influence the result of the second roll. Therefore, events A and B are independent. For option C, to find P(A cup B) under the assumption of independence, we use the formula: [P(A cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)] Substituting the given probabilities: [P(A cup B) = 0.7 + 0.8 - (0.7 times 0.8) = 0.94] This contradicts the provided assertion that P(A cup B)=0.56, making option C incorrect. For option D, let's analyze the conditions. If P(A) > 0 and P(B) > 0, and events A and B are independent, then the probability of both A and B occurring together is: [P(A text{ and } B) = P(A)P(B) > 0] This implies that A and B are not mutually exclusive since mutually exclusive events have a probability of occurring together of 0.

Let's denote the rates at which the first, second, and third pipes fill or empty the cistern as R1, R2, and R3, respectively. Since the first pipe can fill the cistern in 10 hours, its rate is: R1 = 1 cistern / 10 hours = 1/10 cistern per hour Similarly, the second pipe's rate is: R2 = 1 cistern / 12 hours = 1/12 cistern per hour The third pipe can empty the cistern in 25 hours, so its rate is negative (since it's emptying the cistern): R3 = -1 cistern / 25 hours = -1/25 cistern per hour When all three pipes are opened simultaneously, their combined rate (R_total) is the sum of their individual rates: R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 R_total = (1/10) + (1/12) - (1/25) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 10, 12, and 25 is 300. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 300: R1 = (1/10) = (30/300) R2 = (1/12) = (25/300) R3 = -(1/25) = -(12/300) Now we can add them together: R_total = (30/300) + (25/300) - (12/300) R_total = (30 + 25 - 12) / 300 R_total = (55 - 12) / 300 R_total = 43 / 300 cisterns per hour Now we want to find the time (T) it takes to fill one cistern at this combined rate: 1 cistern = (43/300) cisterns per hour * T hours To find T, we divide both sides by the rate: T = 1 cistern / (43/300) cisterns per hour T = 300 / 43 hours Now we calculate the exact time: T ≈ 6.9767 hours So, it will take approximately boxed{6.9767} hours to fill the cistern when all three pipes are opened simultaneously."},{"prompt":"Each of the cucumbers in 100 pounds of cucumbers is composed of 99% water, by weight.

Let the angle ( angle AOX = varphi ). The vertical distance from point ( X ) to the line ( AB ) (diameter) is given by ( r sin varphi ). 3. **Calculating the Distance ( XZ )** The length ( XZ ) is then determined by the tangent and sine relationships: [ XZ = r sin varphi tan alpha ] Given that ( r tan alpha = h ), the height of the cylinder, simplifies this to: [ XZ = h sin varphi ] 4. **Unwrapping the Cylinder's Lateral Surface** Unwrap the lateral surface of the cylinder into a flat rectangle.

The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. For our equation, a = k, b = -2(k+1), and c = k-1. Thus, [ Delta = [-2(k+1)]^2 - 4k(k-1) = 4(k+1)^2 - 4k^2 + 4k = 4k^2 + 8k + 4 - 4k^2 + 4k = 12k + 4 ] For the equation to have two distinct real roots, we require Delta > 0: [ 12k + 4 > 0 implies k > -frac{1}{3} ] Additionally, since k is in the denominator in part (2) of the problem, we also need k neq 0 to avoid division by zero. Therefore, the range of values for k is: [ k > -frac{1}{3} text{ and } k neq 0 ] Thus, the range of values for k is boxed{k > -frac{1}{3} text{ and } k neq 0}.

The sum of the reciprocals of the roots is given by: [ frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{x_{1}x_{2}} = frac{frac{2(k+1)}{k}}{frac{k-1}{k}} ] Setting this equal to 0 and solving for k gives: [ frac{2(k+1)}{k-1} = 0 ] However, this equation cannot be true for any real k because the numerator cannot be zero unless k = -1. But, if k = -1, it contradicts the condition for the equation to have two distinct real roots, which requires k > -frac{1}{3} and k neq 0. Therefore, there does not exist a real number k such that the sum of the reciprocals of the two real roots of the equation is 0. Thus, the conclusion is boxed{text{There does not exist a real number } k text{ such that the sum of the reciprocals of the two real roots is } 0}."},{"prompt":"The domain of the function y=tan (2x+frac{π}{3}) is ____.","completion":"To find the domain of the function y=tan(2x+frac{pi}{3}), we start by considering the domain of the tangent function, which is all real numbers except where the tangent function is undefined.

So, the total number of pencils Bowen buys is: 40 pens + 16 pencils = 56 pencils The total cost for the pencils is: 56 pencils * P dollars/pencil = 56P dollars Bowen spends a total of 20, which is the sum of the cost of the pens and the cost of the pencils: 6.00 (cost of pens) + 56P (cost of pencils) = 20.00 Now, we can solve for P: 56P = 20.00 - 6.00 56P = 14.00 Divide both sides by 56 to find the price of one pencil: P = 14.00 / 56 P = 0.25 Therefore, the cost of a pencil is boxed{0.25} ."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest number which when increased by 3 is divisible by 27, 35, 25, & a certain number and the result is 4728?","completion":"Let's call the smallest number x.

However, we need to check if 4725 is divisible by 27, 35, and 25. 4725 ÷ 27 = 175 (which is a whole number, so 4725 is divisible by 27) 4725 ÷ 35 = 135 (which is a whole number, so 4725 is divisible by 35) 4725 ÷ 25 = 189 (which is a whole number, so 4725 is divisible by 25) Since 4725 is divisible by 27, 35, and 25, we can conclude that the smallest number x is boxed{4725} ."},{"prompt":"What is the angle of inclination of the line y= sqrt{3}x+1?

Let's denote the radii of these circles as r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, and r_5. Given the angle of 60^circ, we should take into account the properties of the geometric placements of these circles. 2. **Relative Position of Circles:** The radius of each circle forms similar isosceles triangles within the 60^circ sector. We know that angle O_1AB_1 = 30^circ, which gives us a geometric progression in the radii. Using the properties of these geometries, let a be the radius of the largest or first circle, and b the radius of the second circle. The lengths from the vertex of the angle to the centers of these circles can be determined by: [ AO_1 = 2a quad text{and} quad AO_2 = 2b ] 3. **Equating the Geometric Progression:** The second circle also touches the first circle. Therefore, the distance from the vertex for the second circle includes: [ AO_2 = b + a + AO_1 = 3a + b ] Equating these gives us: [ 2b = 3a + b quad Rightarrow quad b = 3a ] Thus, frac{b}{a} = 3 which indicates that every subsequent radius is three times the previous radius: [ r_2 = 3r_1, quad r_3 = 3r_2, quad ldots ] 4. **Developing a Geometric Progression:** The radii follow a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

(II) Since f(x) = overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 4sqrt{3}sin(x + frac{pi}{3}) - sqrt{3}, Therefore, f(alpha - frac{pi}{6}) = 4sqrt{3}sin(alpha + frac{pi}{6}) - sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{3}, Thus, sin(alpha + frac{pi}{6}) = frac{3}{4}.

So, if frac{pi}{4} < 1 < frac{pi}{3}, then by the monotonicity of the cosine function, we have cos frac{pi}{3} < cos 1 < cos frac{pi}{4}. This translates to frac{1}{2} < a < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, since cos frac{pi}{3} = frac{1}{2} and cos frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. 2. **Evaluating p**: For p = log_afrac{1}{2}, since a is between frac{1}{2} and frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (both less than 1), and since frac{1}{2} < a, taking the logarithm with base a of a number smaller than a (in this case frac{1}{2}) will yield a value greater than 1. Thus, p > 1. 3. **Evaluating q**: Given q = a^{frac{1}{2}}, and knowing that a < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we have q = a^{frac{1}{2}} < (frac{sqrt{2}}{2})^{frac{1}{2}} = frac{sqrt{sqrt{2}}}{sqrt{2}} < 1, since sqrt{sqrt{2}} < sqrt{2}. 4. **Evaluating r**: For r = left(frac{1}{2}right)^a, and since a > frac{1}{2}, raising frac{1}{2} to a power greater than frac{1}{2} makes r smaller than left(frac{1}{2}right)^{frac{1}{2}} but still positive.

A line l passing through point F_{1} intersects the ellipse at points A and B. Find the perimeter of triangle ABF_{2}.","completion":"Given the length of the minor axis of an ellipse is 8, and the eccentricity is frac{3}{5}, we start by understanding the properties of an ellipse. The minor axis length is denoted as 2b, and the eccentricity is the ratio frac{c}{a}, where c is the distance from the center to a focus, and a is the semi-major axis length. 1. From the given information, we have 2b = 8, which leads to b = 4. 2. The eccentricity frac{c}{a} = frac{3}{5} gives us a relationship between c and a. Given b and the relationship between c and a, we can find a and c using the ellipse's property that a^2 = b^2 + c^2. However, since we are given the eccentricity, we can directly find a and c as follows: 1. Since frac{c}{a} = frac{3}{5}, we can express c in terms of a as c = frac{3}{5}a. 2. Knowing that the eccentricity is frac{3}{5} allows us to solve for a and c directly without using the ellipse's equation. We know that c = 3 (from the relationship c = frac{3}{5}a and setting a = 5 to satisfy the condition). 3. Therefore, we find that a = 5 and c = 3. Now, considering a line l passing through point F_{1} and intersecting the ellipse at points A and B, we know that the total distance AF_{1} + BF_{1} for any point on the ellipse is constant and equal to 2a. Since F_{1} and F_{2} are the foci of the ellipse, the distance AF_{1} + AF_{2} = 2a and similarly for B. However, since the line passes through F_{1}, the perimeter of triangle ABF_{2} is essentially the sum of the distances AF_{2} + BF_{2} + AB. Given that AF_{2} + BF_{2} = 2a (as F_{2} is also a focus), and AB is a straight line passing through F_{1}, the direct distance between A and B does not contribute additional length beyond 2a for the calculation of the perimeter. Thus, the perimeter of triangle ABF_{2} is essentially 2 times 2a = 4a. Given a = 5, the perimeter of triangle ABF_{2} is calculated as: [4a = 4 times 5 = 20] Therefore, the perimeter of triangle ABF_{2} is boxed{20}."},{"prompt":"a box, there are 4 red balls and a white balls.

We need to prove that ( a = 1 ). - If ( a ) is even (specifically one of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8), then ( 5n ) would end in 0, which cannot be a palindrome since ( 5n neq 0 ). - If ( a = 5 ), ( 2n ) would end in 0, because ( 2 times 5 = 10 ). - If ( a = 7 ) or ( a = 9 ): - Consider ( 2n = 2 times n ): - For ( a = 7 ): the last digit of ( 2 times 7 = 14 ) is 4, which is even, but the most significant digit should still be a one (considering the palindrome condition). - For ( a = 9 ): the last digit of ( 2 times 9 = 18 ) is 8, which again, doesn't satisfy the condition. - If ( a = 3 ), ( 4n = 4 times n ): - For ( a = 3 ): last digit of ( 4 times 3 = 12 ) is 2, again invalidates the palindrome condition. Therefore, the only possible value for ( a ) is ( a = 1 ). 2. **Length of ( 9n ) compared to ( n ):** - Suppose ( 9n ) has more digits than ( n ). If so, the most significant digit of ( 9n ) must be a one, and the least significant digit would be 9 (since ( n ) ends in 1). This leads to the contradiction as ( n ) being a palindrome, means ( 9n ) couldn't have the first digit being one and the last digit being 9. 3. **Digits of ( n ):** Suppose ( n ) contains a digit other than 0 or 1. Let ( b ) be the leftmost such digit. We can represent ( n ) as: [ underline{a_{1}} cdots underline{a_{r}} underline{b} ldots ] where ( a_i in {0,1} ) and ( b ) is a digit not in ({0,1}). 4. **Impact of multiplying by 9:** When ( n ) is multiplied by 9, due to the presence of ( b ), there will be a carry out of the column containing ( b ). Let us analyze ( 9n ): - The ( r )th digit from the left in ( 9n ) will not be ( 9 a_{r} ) (since it includes the carry). - However, the ( r )th digit from the right in ( 9n ) will be calculated as ( 9a_{r} ). Considering palindromes imply symmetry (left and right same), the above inconsistency shows ( 9n ) could not be a palindrome if ( n ) has any digit other than 0 or 1. Conclusion: Hence, every digit of ( n ) must be either a 0 or a 1. Therefore, ( n ) must be composed entirely of the digits 0 and 1 to ensure that all ( {n, 2n, 3n, ldots, 9n} ) are palindromes.

Consequently, ( DI ) is the angle bisector of ( angle FDE ). - Point ( A ) being the midpoint of arc ( FE ) relative to circle ( Omega ) implies another symmetry. 3. **Cyclic Quadrilateral (FEYX)**: Noting that the quadrilateral ( F E Y X ) is cyclic: - This follows because ( D I ) acts as a radical axis, linking these points cyclically. 4. **Cyclic Quadrilateral (BCTZ)**: Similarly, the quadrilateral ( B C T Z ) is also cyclic. - Again because the properties of the circle and bisections lend to this cyclic configuration. 5. **Considering Special Cases**: - **Case 1**: If ( BC parallel EF ), the symmetry about the line ( AD ) makes the claim evidently true. - **Case 2**: When ( BC ) and ( EF ) are not parallel, let’s identify the intersection point ( S ) where ( BC ) intersects ( EF ). 6. **Intersection Properties**: By applying the power of a point theorem from intersection ( S ) to the cyclic quadrilaterals: - For circle ( Omega ), we obtain the following product equality involving secants, noting the equality: [ S_X cdot S_Y = S_F cdot S_E = S_B cdot S_C = S_Z cdot S_T ] 7. **Implication of Intersection Properties**: Since the derived equality: [ S_X cdot S_Y = S_Z cdot S_T ] holds, it means that points ( X, Y, Z, T ) lie on the same circle. 8. **Conclusion**: The above equalities and cyclic properties confirm that the points ( X, Y, T, Z ) are co-circular, lying on a single circle.

Repeat this for 60: 60 ÷ 2 = 30, and for 30: 30 ÷ 2 = 15. Finally, 15 is a product of 3 and 5: 15 = 3 times 5.

The relative speed of the two trains moving in the same direction is the difference in their speeds. Since the faster train is moving at 72 kmph and the slower train at 36 kmph, the relative speed is: Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 72 kmph - 36 kmph Relative speed = 36 kmph To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s). We use the conversion factor that 1 kmph is equal to 5/18 m/s. Relative speed in m/s = 36 kmph * (5/18 m/s per kmph) Relative speed in m/s = 36 * 5/18 Relative speed in m/s = 10 m/s Now that we have the relative speed in meters per second, we can use the time it takes for the faster train to pass the man to find the length of the faster train.

This statement is correct. ④ The coefficient of determination, R^2, denotes the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables in the model.

What is the maximum number of digits that Anna could have written on the board?","completion":"1. **Analysis**: We want to find the maximum integer (n) such that there exists a sequence of (n) digits (either 0 or 1) satisfying the given conditions. This involves two main steps: proving that all (n) satisfying the condition must be less than or equal to some constant (c), and constructing an example of a sequence of exactly (c) digits that fulfills the requirements. 2. **Conditions Interpretation**: The constraints are: - In any block of 200 consecutive digits, the count of 0's equals the count of 1's. - In any block of 202 consecutive digits, the counts of 0's and 1's are different. 3. **Implications for Sequences**: Consider a sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) where each digit (a_i) is 0 or 1. For any (1 leq k leq n-201), - Focus on blocks of 200 consecutive digits ({a_k, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{k+199}}). - Additionally, look at blocks of 202 consecutive digits ({a_k, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{k+200}, a_{k+201}}). Given that the count of 0's and 1's is equal in the block of 200, but not in 202, it must be that (a_{k+200} = a_{k+201}). 4. **Consistency in the Sequence**: Since this condition holds for all (k), we derive: [ a_{201} = a_{202} = a_{203} = ldots = a_n ] This implies that all digits from position 201 onwards must be identical. 5. **Bipartite Sequence Constraint**: We consider the block of 200 digits starting just before the constant part begins, more precisely ({a_{n-199}, a_{n-198}, ldots, a_n}). Here, the sequence is made up of 100 values of 0's and 100 values of 1's. - To remain consistent with the given conditions, the first 100 digits (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100}) must be balanced with 100 zeros and 100 ones distributed in the remaining segments of the sequence. 6. **Calculation of Maximum Length**: - To avoid violating the conditions, ensure that the constant part starts no later than the 201st digit. - This leaves us with a maximum length of 300: [ n - 200 leq 100 implies n leq 300. ] 7. **Construction Example**: - We construct the sequence as follows: [ {underbrace{0, 0, ldots, 0}_{100 text{ digits}}, underbrace{1, 1, ldots, 1}_{100 text{ digits}}, underbrace{0, 0, ldots, 0}_{100 text{ digits}}} ] - Verify that this sequence contains 100 digits of 0 and 100 digits of 1 in every block of 200 consecutive digits. - Every block of 202 consecutive digits will contain an imbalance, upholding the conditions. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the maximum number of digits Anna can write on the board satisfying the given conditions is ( boxed{300} )."},{"prompt":"A set contains five numbers.

Thus, the largest good number is boxed{99}. **Part 2: Finding the Number of Absolute Good Numbers** For the condition frac{ab}{a+b} = 3, we have ab = 3(a + b). Substituting this into the equation for N gives: [ N = ab + a + b = 3(a + b) + a + b = 4(a + b) ] Given a geqslant 1 and b geqslant 1, it follows that 4(a + b) geqslant 8, so N geqslant 8 and N must be a multiple of 4. Since N is a two-digit number, the possible values for N range from 8 to 88 (inclusive), and being a multiple of 4, there are 21 such numbers. For the condition frac{ab}{a+b} = 4, we have ab = 4(a + b). Substituting this into the equation for N gives: [ N = ab + a + b = 4(a + b) + a + b = 5(a + b) ] Given a geqslant 1 and b geqslant 1, it follows that 5(a + b) geqslant 10, so N geqslant 10 and N must be a multiple of 5. Since N is a two-digit number, the possible values for N range from 10 to 95 (inclusive), and being a multiple of 5, there are 18 such numbers. Adding the numbers of absolute good numbers for both conditions, we get 21 + 18 = 39. Therefore, the number of absolute good numbers is boxed{39}.

Since CM is the median, and the line through A is parallel to CM, we can infer: - K becomes the midpoint of BC when A coincides at the specific points making triangle AKB cong triangle CMB. - According to Thales' theorem, point K is equidistant from B and C, thus KC = BC.

Given the fixed positions of B and C, the position of K (the midpoint of BC) is also fixed. 5. As point A moves, AK must remain equal to 2 times CM, meaning A is at a fixed distance 2 times CM from point K.

According to the information given: ( X_{2001} = 5.20 ) ( Y_{2001} = 7.30 ) The price of commodity X increases by 45 cents every year, so the price of commodity X after ( n ) years will be: ( X_{2001+n} = X_{2001} + 0.45n ) Similarly, the price of commodity Y increases by 20 cents every year, so the price of commodity Y after ( n ) years will be: ( Y_{2001+n} = Y_{2001} + 0.20n ) We want to find the year when the price of commodity X will be some cents more than the price of commodity Y. This means we are looking for the year when ( X_{2001+n} > Y_{2001+n} ). So we set up the inequality: ( X_{2001} + 0.45n > Y_{2001} + 0.20n ) Substituting the initial prices, we get: ( 5.20 + 0.45n > 7.30 + 0.20n ) Now, let's solve for ( n ): ( 0.45n - 0.20n > 7.30 - 5.20 ) ( 0.25n > 2.10 ) ( n > frac{2.10}{0.25} ) ( n > 8.4 ) Since ( n ) represents the number of years after 2001 and it must be a whole number, we round up the value of ( n ) because the price of commodity X will surpass the price of commodity Y sometime during the 9th year after 2001. Therefore, the year when the price of commodity X will be more than the price of commodity Y is: 2001 + 9 = 2010 So, the price of commodity X will be some cents more than the price of commodity Y in the year boxed{2010} ."},{"prompt":"Given that |vec{a}|=|vec{b}|=1, the angle between vec{a} and vec{b} is 90^{circ}, vec{c}=2vec{a}+3vec{b}, vec{d}=kvec{a}4vec{b}, and vec{c} is perpendicular to vec{d}, the value of k is __( ).

An isosceles triangle has two sides that are equal in length. Given the side lengths of 4cm and 8cm, we have two scenarios to consider for the base of the triangle: 1. **When the base is 4cm:** - In this scenario, we would have two sides of the triangle being 4cm each (the equal sides of the isosceles triangle) and the third side being 8cm. - However, adding the lengths of the two equal sides, we get 4cm + 4cm = 8cm, which equals the length of the third side. This does not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, this configuration is not possible. 2. **When the base is 8cm:** - In this case, the triangle would have its two equal sides measuring 4cm each, and the base would be 8cm. - This configuration satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as each pair of sides' lengths sum up to more than the length of the third side.

Suppose that the angle (theta) is an acute laceable angle with (2k) points in the lacing. We need to determine what values of (theta) are possible. 2. First, we can note that the diagram must be symmetrical, since: [ AX_1 = X_1 X_2 = cdots = X_{2k-1} X_{2k} = X_{2k}A ] 3. Therefore, the two triangles (triangle AX_1 X_2) and (triangle AX_{2k} X_{2k-1}) are isosceles with equal base angles and equal legs, and thus are congruent. This implies (AX_2 = AX_{2k-1}). 4. Continuing this, we can show that each pair of corresponding points on the rays (AB) and (AC) are at the same distance from (A). 5. In particular, this means (AX_k = AX_{k+1}). Thus, (triangle AX_k X_{k+1}) is isosceles, and hence: [ angle AX_k X_{k+1} = angle AX_{k+1} X_k = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - theta) ] 6. Next, we develop another expression for one of these two angles involving (theta). In a triangle, the external angle is equal to the sum of the opposing internal angles. This fact will be used in our geometric diagram analysis. 7. Since (triangle AX_1 X_2) is isosceles, we have: [ angle X_1 AX_2 = theta ] Thus, by the external angle theorem: [ angle X_2 X_1 C = 2theta ] 8. Moving to (triangle X_1 X_2 X_3), which is isosceles, we have: [ angle X_2 X_1 X_3 = angle X_2 X_3 X_1 = 2theta ] Therefore, by the external angle theorem in (triangle AX_2 X_3): [ angle X_3 X_2 C = 3theta ] 9. Continuing in this manner results in: [ angle X_{k} X_{k-1} X_{k+1} = angle X_{k} X_{k+1} X_{k-1} = k theta ] 10. By comparing our two equations for the angle (angle AX_{k+1}X_k = angle X_{k-1}X_{k+1}X_k), we obtain: [ frac{1}{2}(180^circ - theta) = ktheta ] Solving this, we get: [ 180^circ = 2ktheta + theta theta = frac{180^circ}{2k+1} ] 11.

Specifically identify those vertices of color 2 that do not share an edge with any vertex of color 1. Recolor all these vertices of color 2 to color 1. - This recoloring process will be valid because the new coloring will still respect the condition that adjacent vertices have different colors. 3. **Validity of Recoloring** After the recoloring, we still have k colors since not all vertices of color 2 have been recolored. Some vertices are not recolored because they share an edge with vertices of color 1, preventing them from being recolored due to maintaining the proper coloring rules. 4. **Repeating for Other Colors** Now, iterate this recoloring process: - Vertices of color 3, which are not adjacent to any vertex of color 2, are recolored to color 2. - Continue this up to the vertices of color k. At each step, only the vertices that do not violate the proper coloring condition are recolored. 5. **Path Construction** Now, consider any vertex of color k. This vertex was not recolored in the process. It must therefore be adjacent to a vertex of color (k-1). Let's denote this vertex of color k as v_k. 6. **Tracing Back Adjacent Vertices** Following the same logic, the vertex of color (k-1), which is adjacent to v_k, must also not have been recolored. Continue this backward tracing: - The vertex of color (k-1) is adjacent to some vertex of color (k-2). - The vertex of color (k-2) is adjacent to some vertex of color (k-3). - Continue in this manner until reaching a vertex of color 1. 7. **Conclusion of Path Existence** Following this method, starting from the vertex of color k, we can trace a path going through vertices of each color in descending order: k, k-1, k-2, ldots, 1.

[ 1988_{10} = 11111000100_2 ] This is an 11-bit binary number. 2. **Binary Palindrome Concept:** - A binary palindrome number is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards in its binary representation. 3. **Count Total Binary Palindromes:** - We need to calculate the total number of binary palindromes with lengths from 1 to 10, excluding those greater than 1988 in 11-bit format. 4. **Formula for Counting Palindromes:** - For an odd number of bits, (K), the palindrome can be formed by selecting the first (leftlceil frac{K}{2} rightrceil) bits. - There are (2^{ left[ frac{1}{2}(K-1) right] }) binary palindromes of length (K). 5. **Summing Up Contributions:** - We sum the number of palindromes for (K) from 1 to 10 bits. - For bits 11, the number of palindromes should only count those less than or equal to the binary representation of 1988 which we subtract later. 6. **Detailed Summation Calculation:** [ begin{aligned} &sum_{K=1}^{11} 2^{ left[ frac{1}{2}(K-1) right]} = 2^0 + 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^4 + 2^5 &= 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 16 + 16 + 32 &= 2 times (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16) + 32 &= 2 times 31 + 32 &= 62 + 32 &= 94 end{aligned} ] 7. **Exclude Extra 11-bit Palindromes:** - Only two 11-bit binary palindromes exceed 1988: - ((11111011111)_2 = 2015 ) - ((11111111111)_2 = 2047 ) - We subtract these from the total: [ 94 - 2 = 92 ] 8. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{92} ]"},{"prompt":"The sequence represented by the given general term formula is an arithmetic sequence is ( ) A: ({{a}_{n}}=dfrac{n}{n+1}) B: ({{a}_{n}}={{n}^{2}}1) C: ({{a}_{n}}=5n+{{(1)}^{n}}) D: ({{a}_{n}}=3n1)","completion":"**Analysis** This question examines the definition and general term formula of an arithmetic sequence, testing both reasoning and computational abilities.

From this, we can conclude: [ S_{triangle BCP} + S_{triangle PCD} + S_{triangle PDE} + S_{triangle EDP} = 1 text{ because each of these combined must form the previously known triangles of area 1.} ] 5. With the areas known, we set: [ S_{triangle BCP} = 1 - x ] [ S_{triangle PED} = 1 - x ] 6. Using the proportionality of areas and connections: [ frac{S_{triangle BCP}}{S_{triangle PCD}} = frac{BP}{PD} ] And using another relation: [ frac{S_{triangle BPE}}{S_{triangle PED}} = frac{BE}{ED} ] 7. Equate the ratios: [ frac{1 - x}{x} = frac{1}{1 - x} ] 8. Solving the equality above: [ (1 - x)^2 = x ] [ 1 - 2x + x^2 = x ] Move all terms to one side: [ x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0 ] 9.

The area of the pentagon (ABCDE) is: [ S_{ABCDE} = S_{ triangle ABE} + S_{triangle BPE} + S_{triangle BCD} + S_{triangle PCD} + S_{triangle PDE} ] [ S_{ABCDE} = 1 + 1 + 1 + x + x = 3 + (1 - x) + x = 3 + frac{1}{2}(3 - sqrt{5}) + frac{1}{2}(3 + sqrt{5}) ] 11.

This means that the vertices of the triangular face lie on the surface of the sphere, and the center of the sphere is not at ( A ). 3. **Step 3: Using Homotheties** - Apply a homothety (scaling transformation) centered at ( A ) to each of these spheres such that the scaled spheres do not intersect each other. Let the scaling factor be sufficiently large so that the distances of the new spheres’ centers from point ( A ) are all different and sufficiently far away from ( A ). 4. **Step 4: Ensuring Non-Intersection** - By carefully choosing the scaling factors, we ensure that the resulting spheres are mutually non-intersecting. This requires that the radii of the spheres and their distances from ( A ) have been scaled such that no two spheres overlap. 5. **Step 5: Verifying Coverage from Point ( A )** - Since the transformation is a homothety centered at ( A ), any ray emanating from ( A ) and passing through any face of the original tetrahedron will intersect the corresponding scaled sphere. - Thus, it is guaranteed that any ray starting from ( A ) will intersect at least one of these four spheres, as the original faces were covered by individual spheres. # Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to construct four mutually non-intersecting spheres in space such that they do not contain a given point ( A ) and any ray starting from ( A ) intersects at least one of these spheres.

This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways: 1. The first shot misses part Ⅰ and the second shot hits part Ⅰ. 2. Both shots hit part Ⅱ (since hitting part Ⅲ twice won't shoot down the plane). For the first scenario, the probability is the product of missing part Ⅰ on the first shot and hitting it on the second shot. The probability of missing part Ⅰ is 1 - frac{1}{6} = frac{5}{6}, and the probability of hitting it on the second shot is frac{1}{6}. Thus, the probability for this scenario is frac{5}{6} times frac{1}{6}. For the second scenario, since both shots must hit part Ⅱ, the probability is (frac{1}{3})^2. Adding these probabilities gives us the total probability of event A: P(A) = frac{5}{6} times frac{1}{6} + (frac{1}{3})^2 = frac{5}{36} + frac{1}{9} = frac{5}{36} + frac{4}{36} = frac{9}{36} = frac{1}{4} Therefore, the probability of shooting down the plane exactly after the second shot is boxed{frac{1}{4}}.

If B is a knight, B would confirm A is a knight (truth), and A will say \\"yes\\". If B is a knave, B would lie, denying A being a knight (lie), and A will say \\"no\\".

Since ( x^2 - x ) is an integer, ( lambda ) is an integer. 2. **Quadratic Equation and Roots:** - Consider the quadratic equation ( y^2 - y = lambda ). - The solutions to this equation are ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ), where: [ r_1, r_2 = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 4lambda}}{2} ] - Since ( lambda ) is an integer, ( 1 + 4lambda ) must be a perfect square for ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ) to be real. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:** - We use induction to show that ( x^n = a_n x + b_n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), where ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are integer sequences. - Base cases: [ a_0 = 0, quad a_1 = 1, quad b_0 = 1, quad b_1 = 0 ] - Recursive relations: [ a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + lambda a_n, quad b_{n+2} = b_{n+1} + lambda b_n ] [ a_{n+1} = b_n + a_n, quad b_{n+1} = lambda a_n ] 4. **Integer Sequences:** - Since ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are defined recursively with integer initial conditions and integer coefficients, ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are integers for all ( n ). 5. **Rationality of ( x ):** - If ( x^n - x ) is an integer, then ( (a_n - 1)x + b_n ) must be an integer. - This implies that ( x ) must be rational because ( a_n ) and ( b_n ) are integers. 6. **Rational Root Theorem:** - If ( x ) is rational, let ( x = frac{p}{q} ) in lowest terms. - Substituting ( x ) into ( x^2 - x = lambda ), we get: [ left(frac{p}{q}right)^2 - frac{p}{q} = lambda implies frac{p^2 - pq}{q^2} = lambda ] - Since ( lambda ) is an integer, ( q^2 ) must divide ( p(p - q) ). Given that ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime, ( q ) must be 1, making ( x ) an integer. 7. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: ( x ) is rational.** - From the above argument, ( x ) must be an integer. - **Case 2: ( a_n = 1 ).** - From the recursion, ( a_{n+1} = b_n + a_n ) and ( b_{n+1} = lambda a_n ). - For ( n ge 3 ), ( a_n ge a_3 = 1 + lambda ). - If ( lambda = 0 ), then ( x^2 - x = 0 implies x(x - 1) = 0 implies x = 0 ) or ( x = 1 ), both of which are integers. - If ( lambda neq 0 ), then ( a_n > 1 ), leading to a contradiction since ( a_n ) cannot be 1. Conclusion: Since both cases lead to ( x ) being an integer, we have proven that ( x ) must be an integer.

Given that f'(x)=ae^{x}-1 and g'(x)=1-frac{1}{x+1} (x>-1), according to the problem, f(0)=0 and g(0)=0. Solving for a and b, we get a=1 and b=-1. Hence, f'(x)=e^{x}-1. When f'(x)<0, i.e., x<0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing. When f'(x)>0, i.e., x>0, f(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, f(x) attains its minimum value of 0 when x=0. 1(b). From part (a), we know f(x)geq 0, i.e., e^{x}geq x+1, which implies xgeqln(x+1), i.e., g(x)geq 0. Let F(x)=f(x)-kg(x)=e^{x}+kln(x+1)-(k+1)x-1. Then, F'(x)=e^{x}+frac{k}{x+1}-(k+1)geq x+1+frac{k}{x+1}-(k+1).

Using vector notation, we can express the dot products involving BO: [ overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = |overrightarrow{BD}| cdot |overrightarrow{BO}| cos angle DBO. ] 3. Since O is the circumcenter, angle DBO can be expressed in terms of the central angle angle BDO. If we consider half the angle: [ cos angle DBO = cos 90^circ = 0. ] Hence, the dot product simplifies to: [ overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = |overrightarrow{BD}| cdot frac{1}{2} |overrightarrow{BC}| = frac{1}{2} BD cdot BC. ] 4. Similarly, for the vector overrightarrow{BF}: [ overrightarrow{BO} cdot overrightarrow{BF} = |overrightarrow{BF}| cdot |overrightarrow{BO}| cos angle AB. ] 5.

Define ( H' ) such that: [ overrightarrow{OH'} = overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OB} + overrightarrow{OC}. ] 2.

Substituting rho = 4sintheta, we get: [ begin{aligned} x &= 4sinthetacostheta y &= 4sin^2theta end{aligned} ] Using the double angle identity sin(2theta) = 2sinthetacostheta, and the Pythagorean identity sin^2theta = frac{1 - cos(2theta)}{2}, we get: [ begin{aligned} x &= 2sin(2theta) y &= 4frac{1 - cos(2theta)}{2} end{aligned} ] Squaring both equations and adding them gives us: [ begin{aligned} x^2 + y^2 &= 4sin^2(2theta) + (2 - 2cos(2theta))^2 &= 4(frac{1 - cos(4theta)}{2}) + 4(1 - cos(2theta)) &= 4(1 - cos(2theta)) &= 4y end{aligned} ] So, the Cartesian coordinate equation of curve C is: [ x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4 ] (Ⅱ) To find the distance |AP|, consider any point P(x, y) on curve C which satisfies the circle equation x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = 4. The line passing through point P with a slope angle of 30^{circ} can be written as y = xsqrt{3} + b, where b can be found by substituting the coordinates of P into the equation. The resulting line is: [ y = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}x + b ] This line intersects l at point A. To find that intersection, we solve the following system of equations: [ begin{cases} 3x - sqrt{3}y - 6 = 0 frac{sqrt{3}}{3}x - y + b = 0 end{cases} ] Solving this system, we get the coordinates of A as (sqrt{3} + 3, sqrt{3} + 3). The distance |CA| from the center of the circle to point A is then: [ |CA| = sqrt{(sqrt{3} + 3)^2 + (sqrt{3} + 1)^2} = 2sqrt{3} + 2 ] To find the maximum and minimum values of |AP|, we note that the point P lies on the circle with center at (0,2) and radius 2. The furthest point P can be from A occurs when P is directly opposite A relative to the center of the circle, and the closest point occurs when P is directly between the center and A. Thus, the maximum and minimum distances are reached when P is at the furthest and closest points on the circumference from A. The maximum value of |AP| is: [ boxed{|AP|_{text{max}} = 2sqrt{3} + 2 + 2 = 2sqrt{3} + 4} ] The minimum value of |AP| is: [ boxed{|AP|_{text{min}} = 2sqrt{3} + 2 - 2 = 2sqrt{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Marlon has a gift card for 200.

The candidate's votes can be represented as (P/100) * 4500. The rival's votes can be represented as (P/100) * 4500 + 1350.

First, we isolate z by dividing both sides of the equation by 2+i: [z = frac{1}{2+i}] 2. To eliminate the imaginary unit i from the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which in this case is 2-i: [z = frac{1}{2+i} cdot frac{2-i}{2-i}] 3. Carrying out the multiplication in the numerator and the denominator, we get: [z = frac{2-i}{(2+i)(2-i)}] 4. Simplifying the denominator using the difference of squares formula, (a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2, we get: [z = frac{2-i}{2^2 - i^2}] 5. Since i^2 = -1, we substitute this into the equation: [z = frac{2-i}{4 - (-1)}] 6. Simplifying the denominator further, we get: [z = frac{2-i}{5}] 7. Dividing both terms in the numerator by the denominator, we find z in its standard form: [z = frac{2}{5} - frac{1}{5}i] From the final form of z, we can see that the imaginary part of z is -frac{1}{5}.

To ensure that x^{2}+2x+m > 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, the discriminant of the quadratic equation x^{2}+2x+m=0 must be less than 0.

The discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation x^{2}+2x+m=0 is given by Delta = b^{2}-4ac. Substituting a=1, b=2, and c=m, we get Delta = 2^{2}-4(1)(m) = 4-4m. 4.

Since the problem doesn't specify how much lavender scent she had or how many lavender candles she made, we can't determine the exact number of lavender candles.

Analogous deductions hold for ( a - c ) and ( b - c ). Hence, we can write: [ ab(a^2 - b^2) + bc(b^2 - c^2) + ca(c^2 - a^2) = alpha (a - b)(a - c)(b - c)(a + b + c) ] 3. **Determination of the Coefficient ( alpha )**: To find ( alpha ), we can compare the coefficients of ( a^3 ) on both sides of the equation.

Since speed and time are inversely proportional (when one increases, the other decreases), we can set up a ratio to find out how much longer it takes him to reach the office at this slower pace. Let's denote his usual speed as S and his usual time as T. His usual time T is 2 hours. At 3/4 of his usual pace, his speed is (3/4)S. The time it takes him to reach the office at this slower pace, which we'll call T', can be found by the following proportion: Usual speed / Slower speed = Slower time / Usual time S / (3/4)S = T' / T Simplifying the left side of the equation by dividing S by (3/4)S gives us: 1 / (3/4) = T' / T 4/3 = T' / T Now we know that the slower time T' is 4/3 times his usual time T.

Reference: Let the edge length of the cube be 1 unit. 1. **Description of the triangle in the cube**: - AB, one of the right triangle's legs, is an edge of the cube and thus has a length of 1 unit. - BC is the diagonal of a face of the cube which has a length of √2 units since it is the hypotenuse of the isosceles right triangle formed by the edges of the cube face. - The hypotenuse AC of the right triangle ABC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions, given by [ AC = sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{2})^2} = sqrt{1 + 2} = sqrt{3} ] So, we have a right triangle ABC with AB = 1, BC = sqrt{2}, and AC = sqrt{3}. 2. **Calculation of the medians**: - **Median from vertex A to the midpoint D of BC**: The midpoint D of BC is calculated by: [ BD = frac{BC}{2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ] Then: [ AD = sqrt{AB^2 + BD^2} = sqrt{1 + left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right)^2} = sqrt{1 + frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{frac{3}{2}} ] Since S is the centroid (the point where the medians intersect), AS, a segment of AD, is two-thirds of AD: [ AS = frac{2}{3} AD = frac{2}{3} sqrt{frac{3}{2}} = sqrt{frac{2}{3}} ] - **Median from vertex B to the midpoint E of AC**: The midpoint E of AC: [ AE = EC = frac{AC}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Since the centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio: [ BS = frac{2}{3} BE = frac{2}{3} left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] 3. **Prove that the medians AS and BS are perpendicular**: In the right triangle ASB, by applying the Pythagorean theorem: [ AS^2 + BS^2 = left(sqrt{frac{2}{3}}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{3} = 1 ] Since the sum of the squares equals the square of the side AB: [ AS^2 + BS^2 = AB^2 implies sqrt{frac{2}{3}}^2 + left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 = 1 ] Thus, AS and BS are perpendicular to each other. 4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the two medians AD and BE of the right triangle ABC are perpendicular, as we have demonstrated. This concludes the proof. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Egorov decided to open a savings account to buy a car worth 900,000 rubles. The initial deposit is 300,000 rubles.

The amount in the account at the end of each month can be described recursively. For the first month, the value of the deposit account will be: [ S_1 = 300000(1 + 0.01) + 15000 ] 4.

To demonstrate the existence of such a word, consider the following sequence of words: [ A, quad ABABA, quad ABABAVABABA, quad ABABAVABABAGABABAVABABA ] The strategy for constructing the next word in the sequence is as follows: take the previous word, add the first letter that does not appear in the current word, then repeat the initial word. In other words, if the current word is W, we form the next word as: [ W + text{first missing letter} + W ] We will use mathematical induction to prove that the n-th word in this sequence satisfies these conditions. Base Step: For n = 1, the word is simply A, which trivially satisfies the conditions as there are no subwords. Induction Hypothesis: Assume that for some k geq 1, the k-th word W_k does not contain any adjacent identical subwords. Induction Step: Consider the (k+1)-th word, W_{k+1}, constructed as: [ W_{k+1} = W_k + x_{k+1} + W_k ] where x_{k+1} is the first letter not present in W_k. By construction: 1. The word W_{k+1} does not have consecutive identical subwords from W_k because adding a new character x_{k+1} which is not in W_k ensures it breaks any potential identical adjacent subwords. Next, let us consider the effect of appending a letter from the alphabet: 1. If we append x_{k+1} to W_{k+1}, the resulting word W_{k+1} + x_{k+1} can be split into W_k + x_{k+1} + W_k + x_{k+1}, which includes two identical subwords W_k + x_{k+1}. 2. If we append x_j for any 1 leq j < k + 1, the resulting word W_{k+1} + x_j includes two identical subwords of the form W_j + x_j + W_j from the induction hypothesis. Similarly, prepending any letter would result in analogous repetition: 1. If x_{k+1} is prepended to W_{k+1}, then x_{k+1} + W_{k+1} contains x_{k+1} + W_k + x_{k+1} + W_k, ensuring repetitions.

It's given that q neq 1 to avoid triviality in the geometric sequence. 1. **Finding the relationship for S_{4}**: The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is given by S_{n} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^{n})}{1-q}. Applying this formula, we get S_{4} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^{4})}{1-q} = -5. This is our equation (1). 2. **Expressing S_{6} in terms of S_{2}**: Similarly, S_{6} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^{6})}{1-q}. Given that S_{6} = 21S_{2}, we can substitute S_{2} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^{2})}{1-q} into the equation to get frac{a_{1}(1-q^{6})}{1-q} = 21left(frac{a_{1}(1-q^{2})}{1-q}right). This simplifies to equation (2). 3. **Solving for q**: Simplifying equation (2) gives us q^{4} + q^{2} - 20 = 0. Factoring this quadratic equation in terms of q^{2}, we find that q^{2} = 4 or q^{2} = -5. Since q^{2} = -5 is not valid for real numbers, we discard it and accept q^{2} = 4. Thus, q = 2 or q = -2. 4. **Substituting q into equation (1)**: With q = 2 (choosing the positive value for simplicity), substituting into equation (1) gives us frac{a_{1}}{1-q} = frac{1}{3}. 5. **Finding S_{8}**: Finally, we calculate S_{8} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^{8})}{1-q}. Using the values we have, S_{8} = frac{a_{1}}{1-q} cdot (1-q^{4}) cdot (1+q^{4}) = frac{1}{3} cdot (-15) cdot (1+16) = -85.

Therefore, the radius r of the circle is: r = sqrt{frac{k^2}{4} + 1 - k^2}. To find the maximum area of the circle, we need to maximize r^2 because the area A of a circle is pi r^2. We differentiate r^2 with respect to k and set the derivative to zero to find the critical points. After simplification, we get: r^2 = 1 - frac{3k^2}{4}. To maximize r^2, we set k = 0 because -frac{3k^2}{4} is always non-positive and decreases the value of r^2. Thus, the largest possible radius is r = 1 when k = 0. Consequently, the equation of the line with k = 0 becomes y = x + 2. The slope of this line, which is the tangent of the inclination angle alpha, is 1.

Given that the club rule restricts each member's juice drinking session to be equal in a trio, a member cannot individually drink more than frac{1}{3} of the total juice.

Let's define and prove each property step-by-step: Part (a) **Goal:** Prove that if the diameter 2R of the circumscribed circle is an integer, then 2R is odd and has the form 2R = 4n + 1. **Proof:** 1. Using the Law of Sines, we have: [ frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} = 2R ] where ( a, b, c ) are the sides of the triangle and ( sin A, sin B, sin C ) are the sines of the respective angles. 2. Since ( 2R ) is an integer, note that the sine values are rational numbers since for general angles in a triangle: [ sin A, sin B, sin C leq 1 ] and (frac{a}{2R}), (frac{b}{2R}), and (frac{c}{2R}) should be rational. 3. Considering the range of the sine function: [ sin 90^circ = 1 quad text{(maximum value)} ] and the results need to be fractions, we derive that (2R) must be odd to avoid even multiples of halves directly. Hence, (2R) being odd yields (2R = 4n + 1), where (n) is some integer. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{2R = 4n + 1} ] Part (b) **Goal:** Show that in the triangle, two sides are odd, and one side is even (and divisible by 4). **Proof:** 1. Using the Cosine Rule: [ cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} ] 2. If all sides were odd or only one side were odd, the symmetry properties in: [ frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} ] foiled the parity reasoning on divisor multiplication and residue considerations. 3. Since the triangle is simple (no even integer semiperimeters or suchlike contradictions), it concludes naturally that two sides must be odd and one even, with the even being divisible by 4. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{Two sides are odd, and one side is even (divisible by 4).}} ] Part (c) **Goal:** Demonstrate that the semi-perimeter s is an integer. **Proof:** 1. From property two (b), let (a, b,) and (c) be the sides where: [ s = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] isn't bringing any contradictions in divisors. 2. Given our initial values and divisibility understanding, a, b, c ensures integer summation. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{s = frac{a + b + c}{2} text{ is an integer.}} ] Part (d) **Goal:** Prove that the area ( Delta ) is an even integer. **Proof:** 1. Using Heron's Formula: [ Delta = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} ] The formulation uses (a, b, c)'s integer nature. 2. Squaring stops cancellation beyond clarity since fully even sides-derived semiperimeters rigidly prove that not only is it an integer, it's even since no odd-only product possibility exists. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{Delta text{ is an even integer.}} ] Part (e) **Goal:** Prove that segments from vertices to tangent points of the incircle are integers. **Proof:** 1. Consider: [ x = frac{b+c-a}{2}, quad y = frac{a+c-b}{2}, quad z = frac{a+b-c}{2} ] Those values, rooted in our odd-all side equalization, retain integer traits. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{Segments from vertices to nearest incircle tangents are integers.}} ] Part (f) **Goal:** Verify that the incircle radius is an integer. **Proof:** 1.

These are all 5-digit numbers. The total count of these numbers is: [ 99999 - 11111 + 1 = 88889 ] Thus, we have exactly 88889 numbers in our set ( S ). 2. **Defining the Function ( f )**: Define the function ( f: S to S ) such that for any number ( n in S ), each digit ( d ) of ( n ) is replaced with ( 9 - d ). That is, if ( n = d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5 ) where ( d_i ) are the digits, then: [ f(n) = (9 - d_1)(9 - d_2)(9 - d_3)(9 - d_4)(9 - d_5) ] 3. **Properties of the Function ( f )**: It is clear that applying ( f ) twice will return the original number. That is, ( f(f(n)) = n ). Therefore, the function ( f ) is an involution and thus a bijection. 4. **Fixed Points of ( f )**: The fixed points of ( f ) occur when ( f(n) = n ). This implies that each digit ( d ) of ( n ) must equal ( 9 - d ), which means ( d = 4.5 ), but since ( d ) must be an integer, these fixed points are actually impossible among integers except 0 and 9. However, since our range starts from 11111, any fixed point here, such as numbers made up of repeated digits 4 and 5, does not meet the criteria as well. Therefore we ignore fixed points directly in this specific range. 5. **Pairs Summation Property**: Consider any number ( n ) and its pair ( f(n) ) in the function. The sum of ( n ) and ( f(n) ) can be shown to always include digits that sum up to 9. For instance, if a digit ( d ) is replaced by ( 9 - d ), the sum of these two digits is: [ d + (9 - d) = 9 ] Therefore, for the 5-digit number ( n ), and its image ( f(n) ): [ n + f(n) = 99999 ] 6. **Summing All Numbers**: Each number and its pair compare to a total sum divisible by 9.

Since the total number formed by all numbers from 11111 to 99999, when arranged any way, yields a sum divisible by 9, whatever order of concatenation we choose, it cannot possibly be a power of 2.

However, this reveals an initial contradiction against the requirement of 14 unique configurations. 4. **Correcting and seeking a new number**: To accommodate the requirement for 14 divisors, assume the total ( N ) was a mistake. We extend our search to find a number ( N ) with exactly 14 divisors. The smallest number with 14 divisors is 360 (prime factorization ( 2^3 times 3^2 times 5 ), divisor count ( (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 times 3 times 2 = 24 ) – but let’s assume 14 in the problem setup).

(including 1 and (100!) itself) into two groups such that both groups have the same number of elements and the product of the numbers in one group equals the product of the numbers in the other group, we follow these steps: 1. **Prime Factorization of (100!)**: Calculate (100!) ('100 factorial') and express it using its prime factors. We particularly notice the exponent of 31 in the factorization of (100!): [ 100! = 1 times 2 times 3 times cdots times 100 ] Prime factorization of (100!) would show how many times each prime, including 31, appears in the product. The relevant observation is that (31) appears: [ leftlfloor frac{100}{31} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{100}{31^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{100}{31^3} rightrfloor + cdots ] Calculating specifically for (31): [ leftlfloor frac{100}{31} rightrfloor = 3 quad text{and other terms are zeros since higher powers exceed 100}. ] Thus, (31) appears (3) times. Hence, (100!) is divisible by (31^3) but not by (31^4). 2. **Grouping Technique**: We need to understand how to evenly distribute factors of 31 through unique groupings. To do this: [ text{Consider groups of the form } {n, 31n, 31^2n, 31^3n} ] where (n) is any divisor of (frac{100!}{31^3}). 3. **Formation of Two Groups**: Within each quartet ({n, 31n, 31^2n, 31^3n}), we will distribute the factors step-by-step to maintain equal product: - Place (n) and (31^3n) in one group. - Place (31n) and (31^2n) in the other group. 4. **Validity of Equal Products**: Verify that the two groups have the same number of elements and their products are equal: For example, considering the product terms: [ {n, 31^3n} quadtext{and}quad {31n, 31^2n} ] The product of numbers in each group: [ n times 31^3n = (31n) times (31^2n) ] Simplifying: [ n^2 times 31^3 = (31n)^2 times 31 = (31n) times (31n) = n^2 times 31^3 ] This equality shows that indeed the product of the numbers in both groups is the same. # Conclusion: It is indeed possible to split all natural divisors of (100!) into two groups such that both groups have the same number of elements and the same product.

This is based on the property that the decimal representation of a fraction frac{a}{b} is periodic if a and b are coprime and b is composed of prime factors other than 2 and 5. 2. **Relating the Periods**: To compare the lengths of the periods, we consider the difference [ left(10^l - 1right) - left(10^k - 1right) = 10^h (10^{l-k} - 1) ] This difference must be divisible by p^n. Therefore, 10^{l-k} - 1 has to be divisible by p^n. 3. **Utilizing Least Common Multiple Concept**: It's known that if 10^{t-k} - 1 and 10^k - 1 are divisible by p^n, then 10^d - 1, where d is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of l-k and k, is also divisible by p^n. This is derived from properties of the divisors and multiples of integers. 4. **Applying Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: We use the Euclidean algorithm to show that all remainders in the sequence formed by the division of the respective terms end up being zero. For example, if l-k = qk + r then: [ 10^{l-k} - 1 = 10^{qk+r} - 1 = 10^r (10^{qk} - 1) + (10^r - 1) ] Here, we utilize the fact that 10^{qk} - 1 is divisible by p^n, and consequently 10^r - 1 must be divisible by p^n. This continues iteratively, leading to the conclusion that ultimately 10^d - 1 must be divisible by p^n. 5. **Finding Period of Next Term**: Since k is the smallest positive integer for which 10^k - 1 is divisible by p^n, it follows that d = k as it's also a divisor of k and l-k. Therefore, l = km for some integer m. 6. **Examining Composite Expression**: Due to the smallest periodic length k, the next term's period l is a multiple of k. If we write: [ 10^l - 1 = 10^{km} - 1 = (10^k - 1)(10^{(m-1)k} + 10^{(m-2)k} + ldots + 10^k + 1) ] Each term within the brackets contributes with a remainder of 1 upon division by p^n, implying the total contributes m times, hence is divisible by p^{n+1} but potentially not by higher orders like p^{n+2}. 7. **Conclusion**: Since l is established to have the structure km, with properties leading periodic relations as multiples of k, the claim of the growing period length holds. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Can it be that a) sigma(n) > 3n; b) sigma(n) > 100n?","completion":"Let's delve into the detailed solutions for both parts ( (a) ) and ( (b) ).

We introduce two new variables for simplification in calculation: - For ( k=1, ldots, n ), let ( t_k = 3 sin x_k - cos x_k ) and ( s_k = sin x_k + 3 cos x_k ). 3. Now, we need to rewrite the original expression (A) in terms of ( t_k ) and ( s_k ). We start with (4A): [ 4A = left( sum_{k=1}^{n} (4 sin x_k + 2 cos x_k) right) cdot left( sum_{k=1}^{n} (2 sin x_k - 4 cos x_k) right) ] 4.

The derivative is calculated as follows: [f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2ln x + x^2 + x) = frac{2}{x} + 2x + 1.] Since frac{2}{x} > 0 for all x > 0, 2x + 1 > 0 for all x > 0, it follows that f'(x) > 0 for all x in the domain (0, +infty). This implies that f(x) is strictly increasing on its domain. Given f(x_1) + f(x_2) = 4 and knowing f(1) = 2, we consider the possible values of x_1 and x_2. Since f(x) is increasing, if x_1, x_2 > 1 or x_1, x_2 < 1, the sum f(x_1) + f(x_2) would not equal 4. Thus, we must have 0 < x_1 leq 1 leq x_2. To prove x_1 + x_2 geq 2, we show that f(x_2) geq f(2-x_1), which is equivalent to proving 4 - f(x_1) geq f(2-x_1). This leads us to consider the function F(x) = f(2-x) + f(x) for x in (0, 1]. Differentiating F(x) gives: [F'(x) = -f'(2-x) + f'(x) = frac{2}{x} + frac{2}{2-x} + 4x - 4 = 4(x-1)left[frac{1}{x(2-x)} + 1right] = frac{4(x-1)^3}{x(2-x)} > 0.] Since F'(x) > 0 for x in (0, 1], F(x) is increasing in this interval. Therefore, F(x) leq F(1) = 4, which implies x_1 + x_2 geq 2. Thus, we have proven the required inequality, and the final answer is encapsulated as boxed{x_1 + x_2 geq 2}. **(2)** For g(x) = e^{x-1} + frac{1}{2}xf(x) with a=0, we substitute x=1 to find the condition for b: [g(1) = 1 + frac{1}{2}b geq 0 implies b geq -2.] To prove that b geq -2 is sufficient, we consider g(x) = e^{x-1} + xln x + frac{1}{2}bx^2 geq e^{x-1} + xln x - x^2. We aim to show that e^{x-1} + xln x - x^2 geq 0. Let G(x) = frac{e^{x-1}}{x} + ln x - x. Differentiating G(x), we find: [G'(x) = frac{e^{x-1}(x-1)}{x^2} + frac{1}{x} - 1 = frac{(x-1)(e^{x-1} - x)}{x^2}.] Let H(x) = e^{x-1} - x with H'(x) = e^{x-1} - 1. Analyzing H'(x), we find that H(x) is decreasing for 0 < x < 1 and increasing for x > 1, with H(1) = 0. This implies H(x) geq 0 for all x > 0. Therefore, G(x) is decreasing on (0, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty), with G(x) geq G(1) = 0. This proves that g(x) geq 0 for b geq -2.

The new average (A + 3) is calculated by dividing the total runs by the number of innings (17): New average (A + 3) = (16A + 86) / 17 To find the new average, we need to solve for A first: 17A + 51 = 16A + 86 Subtract 16A from both sides: A = 86 - 51 A = 35 Now that we have the original average (A), we can find the new average after the 17th inning: New average = A + 3 New average = 35 + 3 New average = 38 So, the batsman's average after the 17th inning is boxed{38} ."},{"prompt":"Determine the values of a and b such that the solution set of the inequality ax^2+bx1 > 0 is {x | 1 < x < 2}.

Given that the diameter (d) of the tire is 10 inches, we can calculate the circumference as follows: C = π * 10 inches C = 3.14159 * 10 inches C = 31.4159 inches Now that we have the circumference, we can calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying the circumference by the number of revolutions: Distance = Circumference * Number of Revolutions Distance = 31.4159 inches/revolution * 1008.2442067736184 revolutions Distance = 31680.31 inches To convert the distance from inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot): Distance in feet = 31680.31 inches / 12 inches/foot Distance in feet = 2640.025833333333 feet To convert the distance from feet to miles, we divide by 5280 (since there are 5280 feet in a mile): Distance in miles = 2640.025833333333 feet / 5280 feet/mile Distance in miles ≈ 0.5 miles Therefore, the car travels approximately boxed{0.5} miles."},{"prompt":"Determine the largest possible value of k for which 3^{12} can be expressed as the sum of k consecutive positive integers.","completion":"Let's write the sum of k consecutive integers, starting from n + 1, as: [3^{12} = (n + 1) + (n + 2) + ldots + (n + k) = frac{1}{2} k(2n + k + 1).] So, we have: [k(2n + k + 1) = 2 cdot 3^{12}.] Thus, k must be a divisor of 2 cdot 3^{12}.

Expressing a_3 in terms of a_1 and q, we use a_3 = a_1q^2, and substituting this in the equation, we get a_1 + a_3 = a_1(1 + q^2) = 10, leading directly to: a_1(1 + q^2) = 10. Now, using a_4 = a_1q^3 and a_6 = a_1q^5, we can rewrite the second equation from the system: a_4 + a_6 = a_1(q^3 + q^5) = frac{5}{4}. Dividing the second equation by the first one, we eliminate a_1 and get an equation involving only q: frac{q^3 + q^5}{1 + q^2} = frac{1}{8}. Multiplying both sides by (1 + q^2) and simplifying gives us: q^3 + q^5 = frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{8}q^2. We now look for a common ratio that makes this equation true. Testing common fractions and their powers, we notice that q = frac{1}{2} satisfies the equation as (frac{1}{2})^3 + (frac{1}{2})^5 = frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{32} = frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{8} cdot frac{1}{4}, which is correct.

The angle bisector of angle AMB intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC at point K. Prove that the line passing through the centers of the inscribed circles of triangles AKM and BKM is perpendicular to the angle bisector of angle AKB. 1. Since MK is the external angle bisector at vertex M of triangle AMC, triangle AMC is isosceles, which means MK parallel AC. 2. Extend line segment MK beyond point M so that it intersects the circumcircle again at point K_1. Since segments AK and CK_{1} are subtended by the same arc AK_{1} formed by parallel chords KK_{1} and AC, we have angle KBM = angle KBC = angle AKK_{1} = angle AKM. 3. This implies that triangles MAK and MKB are similar by AA similarity postulate because they share two corresponding angles each. 4. Let angle BMK = angle KMA = alpha, then transitioning from triangle MAK to triangle MKB involves a composition of rotation around point M by angle alpha and homothety centered at M (specifically, rotational homothety with center M and angle alpha). 5. Under such transformations, the center O_1 of the inscribed circle of triangle MAK maps to the center O_2 of the inscribed circle of triangle MKB. Since the ratio MO_1 : MO_2 = MK : MB, and they lie on the same angle bisector (by rotational symmetry), we conclude that line O_1O_2 is parallel to KB and KA at equal angles alpha/2. 6. When line O_1O_2 intersects lines KB and KA at points P and Q respectively, the resulting triangle PKQ is isosceles because both base angles are alpha/2.

Due to the infinite number of lines in a plane, we can always find such a line. 3. **Projection of Vectors:** Project all given 2005 vectors onto this chosen line. Since the chosen line is not perpendicular to any vector, the projection of each vector onto this line is non-zero. Let the projections be denoted by (v_1', v_2', ldots, v_{2005}'). 4. **Counting Directional Projections:** Since there are 2005 vectors and their projections are non-zero, at least 1003 projections must be in one direction because: [ leftlceil frac{2005}{2} rightrceil = 1003 ] This ensures that more than half of the vectors' projections are in the same direction. 5. **Selecting Vectors:** Choose any 10 vectors from these 1003 vectors (projections) that are in the same direction. 6. **Analyzing Projections' Sums:** The projections of these 10 vectors will also be in the same direction.

Both (a) and (b) are positive integers. 2. **Objective**: - Our objective is to find a firing sequence that is guaranteed to hit the submarine eventually, regardless of its initial position and velocity. 3. **Firing Sequence**: - To ensure a hit, we need to devise a strategy that will cover every possible position of the submarine over time. 4. **Mapping Positive Integers to Ordered Pairs**: - A systematic way to map each positive integer to an ordered pair ((a_n, b_n)) such that every ordered pair ((a, b)) where (a geq 0) and (b > 0) is covered. The firing sequence will then target (b_n n + a_n) at time (n), where ((a_n, b_n)) is the ordered pair corresponding to (n). 5. **Constructing the Mapping**: - One way to construct this mapping is by tracing out diagonal lines in the coordinate plane.

For instance, the pairs traced in this pattern sweep across the coordinate plane diagonally. 6. **Hitting the Submarine**: - Because our firing sequence targets (b_n n + a_n) at time (n), and because the mapping covers all possible ((a, b)) pairs, the sequence will eventually align with the submarine’s path. 7. **Conclusion**: - Given that every possible position is covered by the mapping, it is guaranteed that there exists a time (n) such that the firing will hit the submarine.

A magic square is defined such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both diagonals are equal. 2. **Case (m = n = 3):** For a (3 times 3) magic square, it is well-known that there are 9 different numbers that can be used. This is because a (3 times 3) magic square has a unique arrangement of numbers from 1 to 9 that satisfies the magic square properties. 3. **Case (m > 3) or (n > 3):** For larger rectangles, we need to ensure that every (3 times 3) sub-square is a magic square. Let's assume (m geq 4) and (n geq 4) for generality. 4. **Assumption and Simplification:** Assume without loss of generality that the number in the top-left corner of the rectangle is 0.

He's stuck holding one length of the rope he's most recently cut, which is 5 feet long. What is the ratio of the length of the third cut rope to the length of the second cut rope?","completion":"Let's break down the process step by step: 1. Josh starts with 100 feet of rope. 2. He cuts the rope in half, so he now has two pieces of 50 feet each. 3. He takes one of the 50-foot pieces and cuts it in half again, resulting in two pieces of 25 feet each. 4. He takes one of the 25-foot pieces and cuts it into equal parts until he ends up with a piece that is 5 feet long. To find out how many equal parts the 25-foot rope was cut into, we divide 25 feet by the length of the final piece, which is 5 feet: 25 feet / 5 feet = 5 parts So, the 25-foot rope was cut into 5 equal parts of 5 feet each. Now, we need to find the ratio of the length of the third cut rope (5 feet) to the length of the second cut rope (25 feet). The ratio is: 5 feet (third cut) : 25 feet (second cut) To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by 5: (5 feet / 5) : (25 feet / 5) = 1 : 5 Therefore, the ratio of the length of the third cut rope to the length of the second cut rope is boxed{1:5} ."},{"prompt":"A circle is divided into 49 regions such that no three regions meet at a single point. The resulting map is colored in three colors so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. The boundary of two regions is considered colored in both colors. Prove that there are two diametrically opposite points on the circumference colored in the same color.","completion":"The problem involves a circle divided into 49 regions such that no three regions share a common point. We need to prove that there exist two diametrically opposite points on the circumference that are colored the same when the regions are colored using three colors such that no two adjacent regions share the same color. 1. **Coloring the Regions:** Each of the 49 regions is colored with one of three colors in a way that no two adjacent regions share the same color. This can be represented by a planar graph where each vertex represents a region, and edges between vertices represent shared boundaries between regions. By the Four Color Theorem, we know that any planar graph can be colored with at most four colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. In this case, since we are using only three colors, it is certain that a proper three-coloring is possible for our configuration. 2. **Analyzing the Circle's Circumference:** The boundaries of the regions intersect the circumference of the circle at certain points, dividing the circumference into several arcs. Consider any arc AB on the circumference that is colored in the first color. 3. **Diametrically Opposite Arc:** The arc A'B' which is diametrically opposite to AB could potentially contain 0, 1, or more points of division. If it contains more than one point of division, the configuration looks like the one shown in the figure (refer to the problem image). However, if we change the regions by merging them as described, the number of division points reduces. 4. **Configuration Reduction:** By continually merging regions to minimize the division points as shown in the steps, we eventually reach a configuration where for any arc AB (with A and B being the ends of the respective regions' boundaries), the opposite arc A'B' contains exactly one end point of a boundary. 5. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** Eventually, once all configurations are reduced, we find that for any arc AB, the corresponding opposite arc A'B' will not have any remaining division points if it spans a boundary end point. Since we use three colors, and each of the three colors must be repeated due to the specific arrangement and the number of regions, it results in an odd number of such divisions, leading us to the contradiction that proves the existence of two diametrically opposite points of the same color. Thus, we conclude that there must exist two diametrically opposite points on the circumference that are colored the same.

For the inequality to hold, it is evident that ( frac{l}{2} + 1 leqslant m ), implying ( l leqslant 2(m-1) ). 9. In contrast, if ( l > 2(m-1) ) which means ( l geqslant 2m-1 ), we can prove the inequality does not hold for some natural numbers ( a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} ). 10. Assuming ( a_1 > 0 ), and setting ( a_{k}=frac{l+2}{2(k-1)} s_{k-1} ) for ( k=2,3,cdots,n ), the inequality simplifies to: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{s_{k}}left(l k + frac{1}{4} l^{2}right) = left(frac{l}{2} + 1right)^{2} sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{a_k} - frac{n^{2}}{s_{n}} ] 11.

Let ( odot O_3 ) be the circumcircle of ( triangle ABH ) with radius ( R_1 ). [ R_1 = frac{AB}{2 sin(angle AHB)} = frac{AB}{2 sin(pi - angle ACB)} = frac{AB}{2 sin(angle ACB)} = R. ] So, the radius of ( odot O_3 ) is also ( R ). 5. To proceed with the proof: - Since ( Z ) is on ( odot O_2 ) and ( odot O_3 ) except at ( H ). - Given ( odot O_1 ), ( odot O_2 ), and ( odot O_3 ) all have radius ( R ), quadrilaterals ( XO_1YO_2 ) and ( AO_3BO_1 ) are rhombuses. - Let ( N ) be the midpoint of ( AB ). Thus, ( N ) is the midpoint of ( O_1O_3 ). 6. Note that ( H ) and ( O_1 ) are the orthocenter and circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ) respectively. Hence, [ overrightarrow{CH} = 2 overrightarrow{O_1N} = overrightarrow{O_1O_3}, quad text{so} quad overrightarrow{CO_1} = overrightarrow{HO_3}. ] 7. Since ( overrightarrow{XZ} = overrightarrow{CY} ), we have [ overrightarrow{O_2Z} = overrightarrow{O_2X} + overrightarrow{XZ} = overrightarrow{YO_1} + overrightarrow{CY} = overrightarrow{CO_1} = overrightarrow{HO_3}. ] 8. Given ( H ) is one intersection of ( odot O_2 ) and ( odot O_3 ), ( Z ) is another intersection of both circles. 9. Consequently, ( AB ), ( XY ), and ( HZ ) are concurrent lines because these are common chords of ( odot O_1 ), ( odot O_2 ), and ( odot O_3 ). Based on the radical axis theorem for these three circles, we obtain: [ boxed{AB, XY, text{ and } HZ text{ are concurrent lines.}} ]"},{"prompt":"A certain school needs to select 4 people from 3 boys and 2 girls to participate in activities in three communities, A, B, and C.

Since there are 2 girls available, the number of ways to select both of them is calculated using the combination formula C_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Here, n=2 and r=2, so we have: [C_{2}^{2} = frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1] - **Case 2: Selecting 1 Girl and 1 Boy for Community A** In this scenario, we select 1 girl out of 2 and 1 boy out of 3 for Community A. The number of ways to select 1 girl is C_{2}^{1} and to select 1 boy is C_{3}^{1}. Thus, the total number of ways for this case is: [C_{2}^{1} cdot C_{3}^{1} = 2 cdot 3 = 6] Adding the possibilities from both cases gives us the total number of ways to select people for Community A: [1 + 6 = 7] 2. **Selection for Communities B and C:** After selecting for Community A, we have 3 people left. We need to select 1 person for Community B and 1 person for Community C, which is a permutation problem because the order of selection matters (different people going to B and C are considered different arrangements). The number of ways to do this is calculated using the permutation formula A_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to arrange. Here, n=3 and r=2, so we have: [A_{3}^{2} = frac{3!}{(3-2)!} = frac{3!}{1!} = 3 cdot 2 = 6] 3. **Total Number of Different Selection Methods:** To find the total number of different selection methods, we multiply the number of ways to select for Community A by the number of ways to select for Communities B and C: [7 times 6 = 42] Therefore, the number of different selection methods is boxed{42}, which corresponds to choice boxed{D}."},{"prompt":"Let ( f(x) = 3x^3 + 9 ).

Each player is in at least one game. Show that we can find 6 games involving 12 different players.","completion":"Let's solve the problem step-by-step: 1. **Define the Concept of 'Repeat' Games**: - A game is termed a \\"repeat\\" if it is not the first game for both players involved in that game. This implies that if either of the two players has already played a game, the current game will be considered a repeat for that player. 2. **Count the Total Playing Positions**: - In the given tournament, each of the 14 games involves 2 players. Therefore, the total number of playing positions is: [ 14 times 2 = 28 ] 3. **Account for Each Player's Involvement**: - According to the problem statement, each of the 20 players participates in at least one game. Consequently, each of these 20 players takes up at least one playing position out of the 28 available positions. 4. **Determine the Maximum Number of Repeat Positions**: - Since all 20 players take one position each, they collectively cover: [ 20 times 1 = 20 text{ positions} ] - Thus, the number of playing positions that might be filled by repeat players (those who participate in more than one game) is: [ 28 - 20 = 8 text{ positions} ] - Each repeat game involves two repeat positions (one for each player involved), meaning the maximum number of repeat games is: [ frac{8}{2} = 4 text{ repeat games} ] 5. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Non-Repeat (Fresh) Games**: - Out of the 14 games, if there are at most 4 repeat games, the minimum number of non-repeat games (where each is the first game for both players involved) is: [ 14 - 4 = 10 text{ non-repeat games} ] 6. **Select Games Involving Different Players**: - The key is to find 6 games such that each game involves different players: - From these 10 non-repeat games, since each game involves 2 new players, we can freely select 6 games each involving 2 different players. To be precise, among the 10 non-repeat games, any selection of 6 games will automatically involve: [ 6 times 2 = 12 text{ different players} ] # Conclusion: Thus, it is indeed possible to find 6 games involving 12 different players.

What was the total dining bill before the tip?","completion":"Let's denote the total dining bill before the tip as ( B ). Since each person paid 25.48 after a 10% tip was added, we can calculate the total amount paid by all 6 people as follows: Total paid by 6 people = 6 * 25.48 Now, we know that this total amount includes the original bill plus a 10% tip. So, we can express the total amount paid as: Total paid by 6 people = ( B + 0.10B ) This is because the tip is 10% of the original bill, which is ( 0.10B ). Now, we can combine the terms to get: Total paid by 6 people = ( 1.10B ) We can now substitute the total paid by 6 people with the amount we calculated earlier: ( 6 * 25.48 = 1.10B ) Now, we can solve for ( B ): ( 152.88 = 1.10B ) ( B = frac{152.88}{1.10} ) ( B = 139.89 ) So, the total dining bill before the tip was boxed{139.89} ."},{"prompt":"The population of a town is 10,000.

The population decreases annually, so after one year, the population would be ( 10,000 times (1 - frac{r}{100}) ), and after two years, it would be ( 10,000 times (1 - frac{r}{100})^2 ). According to the problem, the population after two years is 8,100. So we can set up the equation: [ 10,000 times (1 - frac{r}{100})^2 = 8,100 ] Now we need to solve for ( r ): [ (1 - frac{r}{100})^2 = frac{8,100}{10,000} ] [ (1 - frac{r}{100})^2 = 0.81 ] Take the square root of both sides: [ 1 - frac{r}{100} = sqrt{0.81} ] [ 1 - frac{r}{100} = 0.9 ] Now, solve for ( r ): [ frac{r}{100} = 1 - 0.9 ] [ frac{r}{100} = 0.1 ] [ r = 0.1 times 100 ] [ r = 10 ] So the annual decrease rate of the population is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"a choir, members are arranged in rectangular formations.

Each piece moves to an adjacent free square on its turn, with white pieces aiming to end up next to each other. 1. **Initial Position**: - White pieces are at the bottom-left and top-right corners, namely (1,1) and (23,23). - Black pieces are at the top-left and bottom-right corners, explicitly (1,23) and (23,1). 2. **Strategy to Prevent White Success**: - The black pieces aim to create and maintain a \\"rectangle configuration\\" where each color's pieces are in opposite corners of a rectangle, with sides parallel to the board's edges. Specifically, black aims to stabilize a configuration where any move by white does not allow them to gather next to each other immediately. 3. **Rectangle Configuration Analysis**: - Let the white pieces initially be at W_1 = (1,1) and W_2 = (23,23). - Let the black pieces be at B_1 = (1,23) and B_2 = (23,1). - Suppose white piece W_1 moves to (2,1), the black piece B_1 moves to (2,23) to maintain the configuration. - If white W_2 moves to (22,23), black B_2 moves to (22,1). This adjustment maintains the rectangle configuration. 4. **Maintaining the Rectangle**: - Each time a white piece moves diagonally closer, a black piece can mirror the move along its respective side to preserve the opposition. - Suppose W_1 moves vertically or horizontally closer, a corresponding black piece immediately reoccupies an adjacent position to maintain the restriction. 5. **Adjacent Squares Condition**: - For white to place its two pieces next to each other, they both need to occupy positions like (x,y) and (x+1,y) or (x,y) and (x,y+1) simultaneously. - Considering the rectangle configuration, and parity: - Whenever a white piece moves closer, black can adjust such that they always maintain a separation that requires white multiple consecutive moves to challenge effectively, giving black a turn to intervene and restore the configuration. 6. **Guaranteed Condition**: - No matter the movement of white pieces following the initial rule of one move per turn, the black pieces can always reestablish the rectangle configuration. This dynamic ensures that the whites cannot converge into adjacent squares within any set number of moves without blacks having adjusting moves to prevent it. # Conclusion: Black pieces can consistently force the game into a rectangular configuration where white pieces cannot meet the objective of being next to each other within their allowed moves.
