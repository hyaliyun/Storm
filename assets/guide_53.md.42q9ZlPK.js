A line parallel to another can either lie within the same plane or be outside the plane, not necessarily maintaining a parallel relationship with the plane. Hence, statement A is false. B: The proposition claims that if a line a is parallel to a plane alpha, then a is parallel to any line inside alpha. This assertion is incorrect because a line parallel to a plane could be skew to lines within the plane; that is, it neither intersects nor is parallel to those lines. Therefore, statement B is false. C: The claim here is that if both lines a and b are parallel to plane alpha, then a is parallel to b. This isn't always true because when two lines are parallel to the same plane, they can have three different relationships: they might be parallel to each other, they might intersect (if they lie in a plane parallel to alpha), or they could be skew lines (not in the same plane and not intersecting). Thus, statement C is false. D: Finally, this proposition states that if line a is parallel to plane alpha, and line b is inside plane alpha, then a is parallel to b or a and b are skew lines. This statement is true because a line parallel to a plane cannot intersect a line within that plane.

If he slept too little, he worked drowsily. Sleeping too much made him feel sluggish, and he also had less time for work. He realized that the number of gingerbreads he could make per hour was proportional to the product of the duration of his sleep and wakefulness. How many hours per day should Master Boniface sleep in order to make the maximum number of gingerbreads?","completion":"1. Let x be the number of gingerbreads that Bonifác master makes in one hour. 2. If he works for t hours each day and rests for 24 - t hours, the production rate is proportional to the product of working and resting hours, as given by: frac{x}{t(24-t)} = k, where k is a constant of proportionality. 3. From this, we derive the expression for x: x = k t (24 - t). 4. Define the function f(t) to represent the total number of gingerbreads made in t hours: f(t) = k t^2 (24 - t). 5. To find the maximum production, we need to determine the critical points by taking the derivative of f(t) and setting it to zero: f'(t) = k left( 48 t - 3 t^2 right). 6. Solve for t where f'(t) = 0: k left( 48 t - 3 t^2 right) = 0, 48 t - 3 t^2 = 0, t (48 - 3 t) = 0. 7. The solutions to the equation are: t = 0 quad text{or} quad t = 16. 8. Since t = 0 is not relevant for maximization considering the context (it means no hours working), we consider t = 16. 9. To ensure t = 16 is indeed a maximum, we verify the behavior of f(t): - For t in (0, 16), the function f(t) is increasing. - For t in (16, 24), the function f(t) is decreasing. 10. Therefore, f(t) reaches a maximum at t = 16. 11. Alternatively, using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality): f(t) = 4 k left( frac{t}{2} cdot frac{t}{2} cdot (24 - t) right) leq 4 k left( frac{frac{t}{2} + frac{t}{2} + (24 - t)}{3} right)^3 = 4 k cdot 8^3, and equality holds when frac{t}{2}, frac{t}{2}, (24 - t) are equal, leading to t = 16. # Conclusion: Thus, Bonifác master should work for 16 hours each day to maximize his gingerbread production. boxed{16}"},{"prompt":"a_1, a_2,...,a_{2006} is a permutation of 1,2,...,2006 .

We need to consider the product prod_{i = 1}^{2006} (a_i^2 - i) modulo 3. 2. **Analyzing a_i^2 mod 3:** Since a_i can be any integer from 1 to 2006, we need to consider the possible values of a_i^2 mod 3: - If a_i equiv 0 pmod{3}, then a_i^2 equiv 0 pmod{3}. - If a_i equiv 1 pmod{3}, then a_i^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}. - If a_i equiv 2 pmod{3}, then a_i^2 equiv 4 equiv 1 pmod{3}. Therefore, a_i^2 equiv 0 pmod{3} if a_i is a multiple of 3, and a_i^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} otherwise. 3. **Analyzing a_i^2 - i mod 3:** We need to consider the expression a_i^2 - i mod 3: - If a_i equiv 0 pmod{3}, then a_i^2 equiv 0 pmod{3}, so a_i^2 - i equiv 0 - i equiv -i pmod{3}. - If a_i equiv 1 pmod{3}, then a_i^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}, so a_i^2 - i equiv 1 - i pmod{3}. - If a_i equiv 2 pmod{3}, then a_i^2 equiv 1 pmod{3}, so a_i^2 - i equiv 1 - i pmod{3}. 4. **Counting Multiples of 3:** There are 668 multiples of 3 in the range 1 to 2006 (since 2006 / 3 approx 668.67 and we take the floor value). 5. **Product Analysis:** - For a_i equiv 0 pmod{3}, a_i^2 - i equiv -i pmod{3}. Since i ranges from 1 to 2006, there will be some i such that i equiv 0 pmod{3}, making -i equiv 0 pmod{3}. - For a_i notequiv 0 pmod{3}, a_i^2 - i equiv 1 - i pmod{3}.

Let us denote the point on AC where the perpendicular from B meets AC as H. Assume CH = x. Hence, AH = 4 - x. 2.

Let the radii of ( odot O ), ( odot A ), and ( odot B ) be ( r ), ( a ), and ( b ) respectively. 4. **Application of the Law of Cosines** Using the Law of Cosines for circles ( odot A ), ( odot B ), and ( odot O ): [ (a + b)^2 leq (a + r)^2 + (b + r)^2 - 2(a + r)(b + r)cos(angle AOB) ] Given ( angle AOB leq 120^circ ), (cos(angle AOB) geq -frac{1}{2}), the inequality becomes: [ (a + b)^2 leq (a + r)^2 + (b + r)^2 + (a + r)(b + r) ] 5. **Simplification of the Inequality** Let's simplify this expression further: [ (a + r)^2 + (b + r)^2 + (a + r)(b + r) = a^2 + b^2 + 4ar + 4br + r^2 + ab + 2ar + 2br + ab ] Since ( a geq 5 ) and ( b geq 5 ), it must also hold that: [ 12r^2 geq (a - 3r)(b - 3r) geq (5 - 3r)^2 ] 6. **Impossible Condition** This gives: [ 12r^2 geq (5 - 3r)^2 implies 12r^2 geq 25 - 30r + 9r^2 ] Rearranging gives a quadratic inequality: [ 3r^2 + 30r - 25 leq 0 ] Solving for ( r ): [ r geq frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ] Check shows that ( r leq frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ) is impossible within the given constraints. 7. **Conclusion** This implies that the disk ( odot O ) must have ( r > frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ), i.e., ( odot O ) must contain at least one lattice point due to the fact that any such disk contains a unit square. However, if ( odot O ) must contain a lattice point and serves as a contradiction to the initial assumption that its interior does not intersect with any family of disks containing lattice points. Hence, it is not possible to cover all lattice points in ( mathbb{R}^{2} ) under the given conditions.

In this case, the left-hand side (LHS) becomes: [ sum_{k=1}^n frac{k}{sum_{i=1}^k frac{1}{i}}. ] For large ( n ), the harmonic sum ( sum_{i=1}^k frac{1}{i} ) approximates ( ln(k) ), and thus: [ sum_{k=1}^n frac{k}{ln(k)} approx sum_{k=1}^n frac{2}{k+1}. ] This shows that for large ( n ), the LHS gets arbitrarily close to 2, indicating that the constant 2 is sharp. 3. **Estimating the LHS with a Linear Term**: We use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to estimate the LHS.

The path the tourist takes from the train station (vertex ( A )) to his current location (vertex ( B )) is a sequence of edges.

Consider only the edges that were traversed an odd number of times. 3. **Vertex Degrees and Odd-Even Property**: - The degree of a vertex is the sum of the multiplicities of edges incident to it. - **Claim**: For the graph consisting of the path from ( A ) to ( B ), except at ( A ) and ( B ), the degree of every vertex is even. 4. **Justification of the Claim**: - When the tourist leaves vertex ( A ), an edge's multiplicity increases by 1. - Whenever the tourist passes through an intermediate vertex, they traverse two edges, which makes each intermediate vertex have an even degree (the degree increases by 2 each time the vertex is revisited). - As the tourist finally reaches ( B ), an edge's multiplicity increases by 1. - Therefore, the vertices ( A ) and ( B ) have odd degrees because the path starts at ( A ) and ends at ( B ). 5. **Constructing the Return Path**: - Start at ( B ), where the degree is odd. This implies there is an edge incident to ( B ) with odd multiplicity. Trace such an edge to an adjacent vertex, say ( C ). 6. **Adjusting Path Multiplicities**: - Traverse the edge from ( B ) to ( C ) and reduce its multiplicity by 1. This adjustment decreases the degree of ( B ) and ( C ) by 1 each, making them both even degree for ( B ) and then make ( C ) odd degree. 7. **Iterative Step**: - Now, ( C ) must have at least one edge with odd multiplicity (since its degree is odd). Repeat the process: travel along an edge with odd multiplicity from ( C ) to another vertex, say ( D ), reducing the multiplicity of this edge by 1. 8. **Termination**: - Continue this process. Since the number of edges is finite, this process will eventually terminate. The only way it can stop is if we reach a vertex with an odd degree with no remaining edges of odd multiplicity to traverse. - According to our initial setup and traversal rules, this terminating vertex must be ( A ). # Conclusion: Therefore, it's always possible to construct a return path from ( B ) to ( A ) consisting only of edges that were traversed an odd number of times in the original path from ( A ) to ( B ). boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Find the value of h+k if the center of the circle described by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 6x + 8y + 13 corresponds to the point (h,k).","completion":"1.

Specifically, the rows will repeat every 3 rows due to the cyclic nature of the matrix. - For example, if n = 3k, then the rows r_0, r_3, r_6, ldots will be identical, leading to linear dependence. - Therefore, the determinant of C_n will be zero in this case. **Case 2: n is not a multiple of 3** - If n is not a multiple of 3, we can transform C_n into an upper triangular matrix using row operations. - We start with the (n-1)-th row and perform row operations to \\"slide\\" the leftmost 1 three positions to the right: [ (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, cdots, 0, 1, 1) rightarrow (0, -1, -1, 0, 0, cdots, 0, 1, 1) rightarrow (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, cdots, 0, 1, 1) ] - This process continues until we reach a row that is either: 1. (0, cdots, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1) if n equiv 0 mod 3 2. (0, cdots, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1) if n equiv 1 mod 3 3. (0, cdots, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1) if n equiv 2 mod 3 - In the first case, we have reached a row that is the same as the (n-2)-th one, so the determinant is zero. - In the other two cases, we continue with similar row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular form with all ones on the main diagonal except for the a_{nn} entry, which will be 3. 4. **Conclusion:** - For n equiv 1 mod 3 and n equiv 2 mod 3, the determinant of the upper triangular matrix will be the product of the diagonal entries, which is 3. - For n equiv 0 mod 3, the determinant is zero due to linear dependence.

Let us solve the problem step by step. Start by looking at the case for ( n = 1 ). When ( n = 1 ), the inequality (3) is clearly true. Thus, we assume (3) holds for ( n-1 ) where ( n-1 geq 1 ). 2. Consider the case ( l geq frac{1}{2}(n+1) ). According to Example 2 in Section 4.2, we can decompose ( P(X) ) into chains such that each ( A_i ) for ( 1 leq i leq t ) lies in one chain. Within this chain, there exists a set ( B_i ) which contains one fewer element than ( A_i ). As these ( B_i ) are distinct (lying in different chains), we deduce that inequality (3) holds. 3. Now we address the case ( l leq frac{1}{2}n ). For ( l = 1 ), ( t = 1 ), thus (|Delta A| = |mathcal{A}|). 4. For ( l = 2 ) and ( t = 1 ), we have (|Delta A| = 2 > |A|). If ( l = 2 ) and ( t geq 2 ), there are two situations. - Situation 1: Every element of ( X ) belongs to at most two subsets. Assume ( A_1 = {a, b} ), ( A_2 = {a, c} ). Since ( mathcal{A} ) is an intersecting family, there exists another set ( {b, c} in mathcal{A} ). Hence, (|Delta mathcal{A}| = 3 geq 2^2|A_i| ). - Situation 2: An element ( a in X ) is in ( A_1 cap A_2 cap A_3 ). Since ( mathcal{A} ) is an intersecting family, at least one of the sets containing ( a ) (excluding ( A_1 ), ( A_2 ), ( A_3 )) implies ( |Delta mathcal{A}| = 1 + |mathcal{A}| > |mathcal{A}|). 5. When ( l > 2 ) and setting these ( l ) to be smaller natural numbers, inequality (3) still holds. 6. For ( S_j(j=2, 3, ldots, n) ) step, we reduce the sets containing 1. After a finite number of steps, no new sets are produced. By Example 1, the new family is still an intersecting family and satisfies inequality (2). 7. Consider the following subcases: - If 1 does not belong to any set, then it remains an intersecting family of ( n-1 ) elements such as ( {2, 3, ldots, n} ). - If 1 belongs to ( A_1, cdots, A_s ) and not for ( A_{s+1}, cdots, A_t ), define ( B_i = A_i setminus {1}) for ( i = 1, 2, cdots, s ). Given ( l leq frac{1}{2}n ), we have ( |Lambda_1 cup Lambda_2| leq 2l - 1 < n ). Thus, there exists an element ( j notin Lambda_1 cup Lambda_2 ). Hence, ( S_1(A_1) = A_1 ), which is in ( mathcal{A} ). Thus, ( |B_1 cap B_2 | = | (B_1 cup {j}) cap B_2| = | (B_1 cup {j}) cap A_2 | geq 1 ). Similarly, every pair in ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_s ) has non-empty intersections.

Let the square be ( CDEF ) where ( D ) is on ( CA ) and ( F ) is on ( CB ). 3. **Determine Side of the Square**: In this inscribed square, the diagonal ( CE ) of the square bisects the right angle ( angle ACB ). Therefore, [ BE : EA = CB : CA = a : b ] and [ BE : (BE + EA) = BE : c = a : (a + b) ] thus, [ BE = frac{ac}{a + b} ] The side of the square ( FE ) then is [ FE = frac{b}{c} BE = frac{ab}{a + b} ] 4. **Case 2: Square with two vertices on hypotenuse**: Now, consider a square that has two vertices on the hypotenuse ( AB ).

Therefore, the hypotenuse ( AB ) can be expressed based on ( y ) as: [ y + frac{a}{b} y + frac{b}{a} y = c ] which simplifies to, [ y = frac{c}{frac{a}{b} + 1 + frac{b}{a}} = frac{abc}{a^2 + ab + b^2} ] 6. **Identify intersection properties**: Let's identify points ( G ) and ( J ) such that ( G ) is on ( CD ) and ( J ) is on ( CF ): [ CG = frac{b}{c} JG = frac{ab^2}{a^2 + ab + b^2} ] Points ( I ) and ( H ) are determined: [ frac{BI}{BE} = frac{a(a+b)}{a^2 + ab + b^2} < 1 ] and similarly for ( A, H ), [ frac{AH}{AE} = frac{b(a+b)}{a^2 + ab + b^2} < 1 ] 7. **Calculate the intersection area**: The common area between the two squares is ( ELJGM ).

To find the largest three-digit multiple of 15, we would divide the largest three-digit number, 999, by 15 and take the integer part of the result. 999 ÷ 15 = 66 with a remainder of 9. So, the largest multiple of 15 that is a three-digit number is 66 x 15, which is 990. Therefore, the greatest common multiple of 3 and 5 within the range of three-digit numbers is boxed{990} ."},{"prompt":"Liam makes a snowman by stacking three snowballs with radii 4 inches, 6 inches, and 8 inches.

Notice that this is a quartic (degree 4) polynomial equation in ( x ): [ x^4 + (1 - 2b)x^2 - 2ax + (a^2 + b^2 - R^2) = 0 ] 5.

In our polynomial, the coefficient of ( x^3 ) is zero. 6. Therefore, the sum of the roots of this polynomial is zero because the coefficient of ( x^3 ) (which is ( -2ax^3 )) is zero: [ sum_{i=1}^4 x_i = 0 ] 7. The points of intersection are ((x_1, x_1^2), (x_2, x_2^2), (x_3, x_3^2), (x_4, x_4^2)). 8.

Since we have: [ sum_{i=1}^4 x_i = 0 ] The x-coordinate of the center of mass is: [ frac{0}{4} = 0 ] 10.

Let's first consider the sequence (a_n(k)) defined as: [ begin{aligned} &a_0 = k, &a_n = tau(a_{n-1}), quad n = 1, 2, ldots, end{aligned} ] where (tau(a)) denotes the number of positive divisors of (a). 2. We need to determine the values of (k) such that the sequence does not contain any perfect square. 3. **Case 1: (k) is a prime number.** - If (k) is a prime number, let's denote (k) as (p). - The first term in the sequence is (a_0 = p). - For (a_1), we evaluate the divisors of (p). A prime number (p) has exactly two divisors, namely 1 and (p). Therefore: [ a_1 = tau(p) = 2 ] - Now, evaluate (a_2): [ a_2 = tau(a_1) = tau(2) ] The number 2 also has exactly 2 divisors: 1 and 2. Therefore: [ a_2 = 2 ] - Clearly, (a_n = 2) for all (n geq 1). Since 2 is not a perfect square, the sequence does not contain any perfect squares if (k) is a prime number. 4. **Case 2: General (k) (not necessarily prime).** - Assume (a_{n-1}) (where (n geq 1)) does not contain any perfect squares. - Suppose (a_{n-1} = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_h^{alpha_h}), where (p_1, p_2, ..., p_h) are distinct prime numbers and (alpha_i geq 1) for (i = 1, 2, cdots, h). [ a_n = tau(a_{n-1}) = (alpha_1 + 1)(alpha_2 + 1) cdots (alpha_h + 1) ] - If (a_{n-1} > 2), (a_n) should be less than (a_{n-1}). This is because divisors of any number contribute to a structure that generally diminishes in quantity compared to their exponential forms. - Therefore, (tau(a_{n-1}) < a_{n-1}). - If (a_{n-1}) is a composite number, it must have (h > 1) or (h = 1) but with (alpha_1) being an odd number (as (a_{n-1}) is not a perfect square). 5. **Conclusion:** - The only consistent solution ensuring the monotonic reduction and no perfect squares over all terms in (a_n) occurs when (k) is a prime number.

Firstly, we know that Joseph has 9 red socks, which is 4.5 pairs, but since we can't have half a pair, we'll round down to 4 pairs of red socks. Now, let's use the information given to find out the number of pairs of the other colors: 1. Joseph has two less pairs of red socks than he has pairs of white socks. So, if he has 4 pairs of red socks, he has 4 + 2 = 6 pairs of white socks. 2. Joseph has twice as many pairs of green socks as he has of red socks. So, he has 2 * 4 = 8 pairs of green socks. 3. Joseph has thrice as many blue socks as he has of green socks. So, he has 3 * 8 = 24 pairs of blue socks. 4. Joseph has five more pairs of blue socks than he has pairs of black socks. So, if he has 24 pairs of blue socks, he has 24 - 5 = 19 pairs of black socks. Now, let's calculate the total number of socks: - Red socks: 4 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 8 socks - White socks: 6 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 12 socks - Green socks: 8 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 16 socks - Blue socks: 24 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 48 socks - Black socks: 19 pairs * 2 socks/pair = 38 socks Adding them all together, we get the total number of socks: 8 (red) + 12 (white) + 16 (green) + 48 (blue) + 38 (black) = 122 socks Therefore, Joseph has a total of boxed{122} socks."},{"prompt":"Given the complex numbers ( z_{1}, z_{2} ) such that ( left|z_{1}right| 1, left|z_{2}right| = 2.5, left|3z_{1} 2z_{2}right| = 7 ).

For such a hyperbola, the eccentricity e is defined by the relationship e = sqrt{1 + frac{b^2}{a^2}}. In our case, since there is no b^2 term in the denominator for y^2, it is implied that b^2 = a^2, and thus we can write the eccentricity as e = sqrt{1 + frac{a^2}{a^2}} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}. However, since a is greater than 1, we must look at the expression in terms of a to understand the range of values e can take: e = sqrt{1 + frac{1}{a^2}}. As a increases, 1/a^2 decreases, so the minimum value of e happens when a is at its minimum value, just greater than 1. At a = 1, e would be exactly sqrt{2}, but we must exclude this value because a must be greater than 1. Therefore, the smallest value of e is greater than sqrt{2} but as close as possible to it. As a increases, e approaches 1 because 1/a^2 approaches 0. This means the largest value that e can take is just greater than 1.

For ( a ) (the sum of even integers from 2 to 80): The first term is 2, the last term is 80, and the common difference is 2 (since we are dealing with even numbers).

Prove that by following the arrows, it is possible to reach any vertex from any other vertex.","completion":"The problem states that in a connected graph, the number of incoming and outgoing edges for each vertex is the same. We need to show that one can travel from any vertex to any other vertex by following the edges in the graph. Let us denote the graph by ( G ) and its vertex set by ( V ). We will use the property that the in-degree and the out-degree of each vertex in ( G ) are equal to show the required connectivity. Step 1: Grundwork and Induction Setup Assume for the sake of induction that the graph ( G ) is connected and its edges are directed in such a way that for each vertex ( v in V ), [ text{in-degree}(v) = text{out-degree}(v). ] Step 2: Base Case For the base case, consider the graph with only one vertex. Here there are no edges and trivially, one can reach the only vertex from itself. Step 3: Inductive Hypothesis Assume that any connected graph with ( n ) vertices, where in-degrees equal out-degrees for all vertices, allows for the traversal from any vertex to any other vertex. Step 4: Inductive Step Consider a connected graph ( G ) with ( n+1 ) vertices, where the in-degrees and out-degrees match for all vertices. Step 5: Analyzing Strongly Connected Components First, decompose ( G ) into its strongly connected components. Let ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k ) denote these components. Since ( G ) is connected and each strongly connected component has balanced in-degrees and out-degrees, it is necessary to show that these components combine to form a larger strongly connected component encompassing all ( n+1 ) vertices. Step 6: Component Connections If every vertex inside each component can be reached from any other in the same component, we must show these components are reachable by directed paths implying a strongly connected graph. 1. Consider two components ( C_i ) and ( C_j ). By the properties of strongly connected graphs and the balancing of in-degrees and out-degrees: - For any vertex ( u in C_i ) and ( v in C_j ), there exists a directed path from ( u ) to ( v ) traversing through component connections due to the graph's connectivity. 2. Thus any vertex ( u ) has a path reaching any ( v ), either within the same component or through other components. Conclusion Given this connectedness and the property of balanced in-degree and out-degree for each vertex, it follows that the graph ( G ) is strongly connected.

The centroid of four points ((x_i, y_i)) for (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) is given by: [ left(frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4}{4}, frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4}{4}right) ] For the centroid to be a lattice point, both coordinates must be integers, which implies that (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) and (y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4) must be divisible by 4. 2. **Reduction to Modulo 4:** We can consider the coordinates modulo 4. This means we can treat two points as equivalent if their coordinates are congruent modulo 4. Thus, we only need to consider points in the set ({(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}). 3. **Constructing a Set of 12 Points:** Consider the set of points: [ {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)} ] This set contains 12 points, each with distinct coordinates modulo 4. We need to show that the centroid of any four points from this set is not a lattice point. 4. **Checking the Centroid Condition:** For any four points ((x_i, y_i)), the sum (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4) and (y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4) must not be divisible by 4. Since we have chosen points with distinct coordinates modulo 4, the sum of any four (x)-coordinates or (y)-coordinates will not be divisible by 4. Therefore, the centroid will not be a lattice point. 5. **Proving the Upper Bound:** Suppose there exists a set of 13 points. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one pair of points must have the same coordinates modulo 4. This means there are at least 5 pairs of points with the same coordinates modulo 4. The sum of the coordinates of these pairs will be even, and since there are only 4 possible pairs of even coordinates modulo 4, at least two pairs will sum to the same point. This implies that the sum of the coordinates of these four points will be divisible by 4, making the centroid a lattice point, which contradicts the condition.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. Length of the train = 460 meters Length of the bridge = 140 meters Total distance to cover = Length of the train + Length of the bridge Total distance to cover = 460 meters + 140 meters Total distance to cover = 600 meters Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the distance. Speed of the train = 45 km/hour To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds Speed of the train in m/s = 45 km/h * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Speed of the train in m/s = 45 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 45 * (5 / 18) Speed of the train in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s and the total distance in meters, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to pass the bridge = Total distance to cover / Speed of the train in m/s Time to pass the bridge = 600 meters / 12.5 m/s Time to pass the bridge = 48 seconds Therefore, it will take the train boxed{48} seconds to pass the bridge."},{"prompt":"f a clock strikes 12 in 33 seconds , it will strike 6 in how many seconds ?","completion":"The clock strikes 12 times for 12 o'clock, but the first strike doesn't require a gap of time before it since it starts the series of strikes.

Observing the structure logically, numbers to the left of 1 decrease sequentially, and to the right they increase sequentially. 3. **Breaking Down the Problem**: - After placing 1, the remaining numbers {2, 3, ..., 10} are divided into two groups: those to the left of 1 in decreasing order and those to the right of 1 in increasing order. - Selection of these numbers simply needs to be grouped into which ones fall to the left and which ones to the right of 1. 4. **Determining the subsets**: - All possible subsets of the set {2, 3, ..., 10} can be chosen to be either to the left or right of 1. - This amounts to finding the number of ways to partition the 9 remaining numbers (excluding 1). 5. **Calculating the subsets**: - From combinatorial theory, the total number of ways to partition these numbers into two groups is given by the power set (since each number has 2 choices). - The number of subsets of a set of size 9 is (2^9). 6. **Final Calculation**: - (2^9 = 512). # Conclusion: Thus, the number of ways to place the numbers 1 through 10 in the strip such that they obey the given conditions is ( boxed{512} )."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are denoted as a, b, and c respectively, and it satisfies sqrt{3}ccos A = asin C.

Since efficiency is directly proportional to the amount of work done in a day, we can write: ( W_A = frac{1}{2}W_B ) and ( W_B = frac{2}{3}W_C ). The total work done by A, B, and C in one day when working together is ( W_A + W_B + W_C ). Since they can finish the job in 15 days, the total work ( W ) can be represented as: ( W = 15(W_A + W_B + W_C) ). Now, let's express ( W_A ) and ( W_C ) in terms of ( W_B ): ( W_A = frac{1}{2}W_B ) and ( W_C = frac{3}{2}W_B ) (from ( B = frac{2}{3}C ), we get ( C = frac{3}{2}B )). Substituting these into the total work equation, we get: ( W = 15left(frac{1}{2}W_B + W_B + frac{3}{2}W_Bright) ) ( W = 15left(frac{1}{2} + 1 + frac{3}{2}right)W_B ) ( W = 15left(2 + frac{1}{2}right)W_B ) ( W = 15 cdot frac{5}{2}W_B ) ( W = frac{75}{2}W_B ). Now, to find out how many days B needs to finish the job alone, we divide the total work ( W ) by the amount of work B does in one day ( W_B ): ( text{Days for B to finish alone} = frac{W}{W_B} ) ( text{Days for B to finish alone} = frac{frac{75}{2}W_B}{W_B} ) ( text{Days for B to finish alone} = frac{75}{2} ) ( text{Days for B to finish alone} = 37.5 ). Therefore, B would need boxed{37.5} days to finish the job alone."},{"prompt":"A firetruck is stationed at the intersection of two perpendicular roads in a flat desert region.

We need to ensure that each basket has exactly 10 kg of rice and 30 eggs. 2. **Initial Conditions:** We are given that the total amount of rice is 1000 kg and the total number of eggs is 3000. Therefore, the sum of rice in all baskets is: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i = 1000 ] and the sum of eggs in all baskets is: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i = 3000 ] 3. **Existence of Sufficient Resources:** We need to show that there exist two baskets ( i ) and ( j ) such that ( a_i + a_j geq 10 ) and ( b_i + b_j geq 30 ). 4. **Proof for Eggs:** Suppose ( b_m ) is the maximum number of eggs in any basket.

It turned out that the number 1 appeared in the notebook exactly 85 times. Let d be the largest number written in the notebook. Find the smallest possible value of d.","completion":"1. We start by noting that there are 99 different integers written on the board, and the number 1 appears exactly 85 times as a difference between any two of those numbers. We aim to find the smallest possible value of d, where d is the largest number listed in the notebook. 2. The setup implies we have all differences between any two numbers on the board. Given that there are 99 numbers, the number of possible pairs of those numbers (ignoring order) is binom{99}{2}, which is: binom{99}{2} = frac{99 cdot 98}{2} = 4851 3. To proceed, let's consider breaking down the numbers on the board into sequential chains of numbers. A chain, a, a+1, a+2, ldots, a+t, will ensure that within any chain, all differences of 1 between adjacent numbers are present. Importantly, no difference of 1 exists between numbers from different chains. 4. Suppose these numbers are partitioned into k such chains where each chain i contains n_i numbers. Consequently, in a chain with n_i numbers, there are exactly n_i - 1 differences of 1 because the difference of 1 occurs between each pair of consecutive numbers in the chain. Therefore, the total number of differences of 1 is: (n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1) + ldots + (n_k - 1) = sum_{i=1}^k (n_i - 1) = left(sum_{i=1}^k n_iright) - k = 99 - k 5. Given that the number 1 appears exactly 85 times in total, we equate: 99 - k = 85 implies k = 14 6. We now deduce that the numbers are divided into 14 chains. For the distribution to hold, the smallest possible value of these chains needs to assure at least one chain has as many numbers as possible. 7. Considering that the optimal way to divide 99 into 14 parts involves distributing as evenly as possible, the average size of a chain is approximately: frac{99}{14} approx 7.07 8. Given that chain sizes must be integers, at least one chain must have 8 numbers to make up for the remaining discrepancy (since the average implies most would have 7). The largest difference within such a chain would be: 8 - 1 = 7 9. Finally, we need to confirm whether this is the minimal d by example. Consider the numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ldots, 7 This chain indeed spans the range from 0 to 7, making d = 7 the largest difference. 10.

Assign numbers to the people from 1 to 40 in a clockwise direction. 3. textbf{Key Observation}: If the numbers of two people have the same parity (i.e., both are either odd or both are even), the number of people sitting between them is odd. Conversely, if the numbers of two people have different parity (one is odd and the other is even), the number of people sitting between them is even. 4. Let’s select a specific person, say person A. Suppose the person A has an even number ( k ). 5. Consider another person B seated such that there is an even number of people between A and B. There are 20 such people, because starting from person A, every alternate person will have the same parity. 6. These 20 people should have numbers of the same parity as ( A ) (i.e., even). 7. Since the 20 people (including (A)) must all have an even parity, between any pair amongst these 20 people, there will be an odd number of people seated (since both have the same parity). 8. According to the problem, these 20 people cannot have a common acquaintance since they have an even number of people between them, but also must all connect with some common acquaintance, which is contradictory. 9. Therefore, we have a contradiction. - Since the 20 people with the same parity cannot have a common acquaintance, as it violates the condition mentioned (as there should be an odd number of people between them). **Conclusion:** We have derived a contradiction from the initial assumption. Thus, it is not possible to seat the 40 people in such a way to meet the conditions provided in the problem. Thus, the answer is: boxed{text{No, it cannot happen}}"},{"prompt":"What is the smallest prime number whose digits sum to 23?","completion":"To have a digit sum of 23, we consider at least a 3-digit prime. Since 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 (for three digits) exceeds our target and 9 + 9 + 5 = 23 is achievable, we start with checking 3-digit numbers. The smallest 3-digit number to check is 599. However, we also check for 4-digit alternatives like 1499, which has a digit sum of 1 + 4 + 9 + 9 = 23. We first try 599: - It is odd, not divisible by 2. - The digit sum is not divisible by 3. - It doesn’t end in 0 or 5, thus not divisible by 5. - Manually checking for divisibility by 7, 11, and 13 shows it is not divisible by these primes. Since 599 passes the primality test, we now check if this is the smallest possible prime or if a 4-digit number like 1499 could be smaller. Checking 1499: - It is odd, not divisible by 2. - The digit sum is not divisible by 3. - It doesn’t end in 0 or 5, thus not divisible by 5. - Manually checking for divisibility by 7, 11, and 13 shows it is not divisible by these primes.

The distance from marker A to marker B is given as 120 miles. Since the distance from marker B to marker C is half of that, it is ( frac{120}{2} = 60 ) miles.

To find ( t ), we can use the average speed for the entire trip, which is given as 45 miles per hour.

The area of each rectangle T_n is given by: [ text{Area}(T_n) = 8^n cdot frac{1}{8^n} = 1 ] 2. **Showing T_n cannot be covered by other rectangles:** Suppose n > k, and consider the potential maximum area of the overlapping region between T_n and T_k. We assume an arbitrary placement and overlap of the rectangles T_n and T_k. If the overlap is not empty, enclose it in a rectangle with one side on two opposite sides of T_n and the other two sides parallel to the shorter sides of T_n. The smallest such rectangle will have one side of length frac{1}{8^n} and the other side, given the vertices P and Q of T_k, will not exceed the diagonal of T_k. 3. **Calculate the overlap area:** The diagonal of T_k is smaller than twice the longer side of T_k, which is 2 cdot 8^k.

Introduction: To solve this problem, we use a general property about triangles in a rectangle.

The smallest divisors of any number ( n ) are typically 1, 2, 3, etc. However, since we are excluding ( n ) itself, we need to consider the next largest divisors. 4. **Testing with Small Numbers:** Let's test with small numbers to understand the pattern: - For ( n = 12 ): The divisors are ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 ). The largest three divisors excluding 12 are ( 6, 4, 3 ). [ 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 > 12 ] So, 12 is in ( S ). - For ( n = 30 ): The divisors are ( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30 ). The largest three divisors excluding 30 are ( 15, 10, 6 ). [ 15 + 10 + 6 = 31 > 30 ] So, 30 is in ( S ). 5. **Generalizing the Pattern:** From the examples, we see that the smallest divisors ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ) must be 2 and 3 respectively to ensure the sum of the largest three divisors is greater than ( n ). This implies that ( n ) must be divisible by both 2 and 3. 6. **Finding the Largest ( k ):** Since ( n ) must be divisible by both 2 and 3, the largest ( k ) that divides any number in ( S ) is the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 3: [ text{LCM}(2, 3) = 6 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"Determine the distance from the center of the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=2 to the line y=x+sqrt{2}.","completion":"First, find the center of the circle.

Show that only finitely many such operations can be performed. *Proposed by Joe Benton, United Kingdom.*","completion":"1. **Define the problem and the claim:** We are given a finite set mathcal{S} of lattice points in the Cartesian plane. We repeatedly perform an operation where we replace two distinct lattice points A and B in mathcal{S} with two distinct lattice points C and D not in mathcal{S} such that ACBD forms a parallelogram with AB > CD. We need to show that only finitely many such operations can be performed. 2. **Introduce the key idea:** We claim that the sum of the squares of the distances between all pairs of points in mathcal{S} strictly decreases with each operation. Specifically, we consider the sum: [ S = sum_{substack{A, B in mathcal{S} A neq B}} AB^2 ] We will show that this sum strictly decreases with each operation. 3. **Analyze the operation:** Consider the operation where we replace A and B with C and D. Let M be the midpoint of both overline{AB} and overline{CD}, since ACBD is a parallelogram. By the properties of a parallelogram, the midpoints of overline{AB} and overline{CD} coincide. 4. **Use the median length formula:** For any point P in mathcal{S} other than A, B, C, D, we use the median length formula. The formula for the length of a median in a triangle states that for any triangle with vertices P, A, B and median PM: [ PA^2 + PB^2 = 2PM^2 + frac{1}{2}AB^2 ] Applying this to our situation, we get: [ PA^2 + PB^2 = 2PM^2 + frac{1}{2}AB^2 ] Similarly, for the points C and D: [ PC^2 + PD^2 = 2PM^2 + frac{1}{2}CD^2 ] 5. **Compare the sums:** Since AB > CD, we have AB^2 > CD^2. Therefore: [ PA^2 + PB^2 > PC^2 + PD^2 ] Summing this inequality over all points P in mathcal{S} other than A, B, C, D, we get: [ sum_{P in mathcal{S} setminus {A, B, C, D}} (PA^2 + PB^2) > sum_{P in mathcal{S} setminus {A, B, C, D}} (PC^2 + PD^2) ] 6. **Sum over all pairs:** Including the pairs (A, B) and (C, D), we have: [ sum_{substack{A, B in mathcal{S} A neq B}} AB^2 > sum_{substack{C, D in mathcal{S} C neq D}} CD^2 ] This shows that the sum S strictly decreases with each operation. 7. **Conclude the proof:** Since mathcal{S} is a finite set of lattice points, the sum S is a finite integer. A strictly decreasing sequence of finite integers must terminate after finitely many steps.

Each of these sets is made up of intervals along the edge. 9. At some point, (X) and (Y) must intersect at a point (P) along the edge. Consequently, there must be points (F_1) on (L_1) and (F_2) on (L_2) such that (P) is within (0.5) units from both (F_1) and (F_2). 10.

First, let's denote the coordinates of the foci as F_1 = (-c, 0) and F_2 = (c, 0), where c is the linear eccentricity of the hyperbola.

From the relation c = ae, we can derive c^2 = a^2 + b^2. 2. Now, let's denote the coordinates of point P as P = (x_P, y_P).

Now, let's substitute PF_1 = sqrt{(x_P + c)^2 + y_P^2} and F_1F_2 = 2c. After simplification, we get (x_P + c)^2 + y_P^2 = 3c^2 5.

We divide each side into three equal parts, making each segment s/3 in length. Points D, E, and F divide AB, BC, and CA into segments: AD = DB = BE = EC = CF = FA = s/3. Segments overline{DF} and overline{EF} are composed of sections of the triangle and can be computed using the triangle's properties. By connecting these trisection points, we create a new smaller triangle, triangle DEF. Now, triangle DEF is also equilateral (as all sides are equal due to the symmetry and equal division) and each side's length of triangle DEF is calculated using the formula for the length of a segment between points dividing a side of the equilateral triangle: DE = EF = FD = sqrt{left(frac{2s}{3}right)^2 - left(frac{s}{3}right)^2} = frac{ssqrt{3}}{3} Point G is the midpoint of DF, and H is the midpoint of EF.

We know from the problem statement the total number of problems is 100. Hence, we have the equation: [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + y_{1,2} + y_{1,3} + y_{2,3} + z = 100 ] 3. Each student solved 60 problems. Therefore, for each student, we can write the following equations: [ x_1 + y_{1,2} + y_{1,3} + z = 60 ] [ x_2 + y_{1,2} + y_{2,3} + z = 60 ] [ x_3 + y_{1,3} + y_{2,3} + z = 60 ] 4.

Subtracting the first equation from this result, we can solve for (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 - z): [ (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + 2y_{1,2} + 2y_{1,3} + 2y_{2,3} + 3z) - (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + y_{1,2} + y_{1,3} + y_{2,3} + z) = 180 - 100 ] [ y_{1,2} + y_{1,3} + y_{2,3} + 2z = 80 ] 7.

The roots of the equation are given by: x = frac{-(-2b) pm sqrt{(-2b)^2 - 4(-3)(0)}}{2(-3)} = frac{2b pm sqrt{4b^2}}{-6} = frac{2b pm 2b}{-6}. For f'(x) to be non-negative for 0 leq x leq 6: - If b<0, the parabola opens upwards, and f'(x) < 0 for any x > 0, thus b can not be negative. - If b=0, the derivative is f'(x) = -3x^2 leq 0 for all x, so b = 0 is not valid since f'(x) is not positive within (0, 6]. - For b>0, the parabola opens downwards, and f'(x) geq 0 if the vertex of the parabola lies at or to the left of x=0, which will be the case if the discriminant is less than or equal to zero: 4b^2 - 4(-3)(0) leq 0. Since the discriminant is non-negative for all b neq 0, and we already ruled out b leq 0, this means that there is no upper bound for b.

Each member claims that among their neighbors (to the left, right, front, and back) there are representatives of both parties (liars and truth-lovers). Liars always lie, and truth-lovers always tell the truth. We need to find the minimum number of liars that can make the described situation possible. 2. **Analyzing the Situation with Groups**: We can group the members of the presidium into eight distinct groups. This division can be visualized as shown in the image (omitted but implied here), where each group consists of members seated in such a way that they cover the entire presidium. Let's label these eight groups as ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_8 ). 3. **Assumption Analysis**: Assume the number of liars is fewer than eight. If there are fewer than eight liars, say ( L < 8 ), then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one group ( G_i ) must consist entirely of truth-lovers. - Truth-lovers who always say the truth would mean the claim that there are representatives of both parties among their neighbors must be true. However, if a group consists entirely of truth-lovers, then there wouldn’t be any liars among their neighbors. - This contradiction implies that having fewer than eight liars is impossible because it invalidates the claim made by the truth-lovers. 4. **Verification with Eight Liars**: To see if eight liars would work, we distribute one liar in each group ( G_1, G_2, ldots, G_8 ) obeying the seating arrangement provided. - Doing so ensures that each group contains at least one liar. Thus, truth-lovers in each group would have a neighboring liar (making their claim true). - Liars can make any claim, true or false, so their claims about having both parties among their neighbors do not disrupt the requirement. The illustration provided in the reference shows a valid arrangement of eight liars and confirms that truth-lovers can consistently make truthful statements about their neighbors. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, based on the analysis and given constraints, the minimum number of liars that can make the described situation possible while ensuring all claims are logically consistent is eight.

Both alpha and beta contain at least one city; 2. For each city, there is at most one highway connecting it to a city in the other group. We will use mathematical induction on m to prove the existence of such a partition. Base Case: First, consider m = 2. If there are n = 1 road connecting the cities, then partition one city into alpha and the other into beta. This partition clearly satisfies the conditions. Next, consider m = 3, with the maximum n value being 3. The cities and roads form a triangle, and we can partition any single city into alpha and the other two cities into beta, giving only one highway connecting the groups (assuming no multiple roads between two cities). Thus, the base cases are proven. Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for all k such that 2 leq k < m. We need to prove it for k = m. Suppose we have m cities. If there exists a city with degree at most 1, place this city solely into one group, and the others into the other group. This satisfies the partition requirement easily. Now, let's consider the case where each city has a degree of at least 2. Let d(v) denote the degree of a city v. Let a, b, and c be the number of cities with degree 2, 3, and at least 4, respectively. Clearly, we have a + b + c = m. We know that: - For degree 2 cities, we have 2a roads. - For each degree 3 city, from Lemma 5 (each city connected to at least 2 cities of degree at least 3), we get an inequality involving 2c geq 3c implies d geq 3(a+c).

Testing intervals: - For ( a in [-2, -1) ): ( (a - 3) < 0 ) and ( (a + 1) < 0 ) both negative. - For ( a = -1 ): ( a^2 - 2a - 3 = 0 ) - For ( a in (-1, 3) ): ( (a - 3) < 0 ) and ( (a + 1) > 0 ) making the product ( < 0 ). - For ( a = 3 ): ( a^2 - 2a - 3 = 0 ) - For ( a > 3 ): ( (a - 3) > 0 ) and ( (a + 1) > 0 ) both positive.

Prove that any sufficiently large positive integer can be written as a sum of elements of A. (Elements may occur several times in the sum.)","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions:** Let ( A ) be a set of positive integers such that no positive integer greater than 1 divides all the elements of ( A ). This implies that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the set ( A ) is 1, i.e., (gcd(A) = 1). 2. **Selection of an Element ( a ) from ( A ):** Take some ( a in A ). If ( a = 1 ), then any positive integer can be written as a sum of elements of ( A ) (since 1 can be added any number of times to reach any positive integer). Therefore, we assume ( a > 1 ). 3. **Prime Factorization of ( a ):** Factorize ( a ) as ( a = prod_{k=1}^n p_k^{e_k} ), where ( p_k ) are distinct prime numbers and ( e_k ) are their respective exponents. 4. **Existence of Elements ( a_k ) in ( A ):** Since (gcd(A) = 1), for each prime ( p_k ) in the factorization of ( a ), there exists an element ( a_k in A ) such that ( p_k nmid a_k ). This means ( a_k ) is not divisible by ( p_k ). 5. **Construction of ( b_k ):** Define ( P = prod_{k=1}^n p_k ). For each ( k ), construct ( b_k = a_k frac{P}{p_k} ). Notice that ( b_k ) is a multiple of ( a_k ) and ( frac{P}{p_k} ), ensuring that ( p_k nmid b_k ). 6. **Summation to Form ( b ):** Define ( b = sum_{k=1}^n b_k ). Since ( p_k nmid b_k ) and ( p_i mid b_j ) for ( i neq j ), it follows that ( p_k nmid b ) for any ( 1 leq k leq n ). Therefore, (gcd(a, b) = 1). 7. **Representation of Large Integers:** By Sylvester's theorem, for two coprime integers ( a ) and ( b ), any sufficiently large integer ( N ) can be expressed as a linear combination of ( a ) and ( b ). Specifically, there exists some ( N_0 ) such that any integer ( N geq N_0 ) can be written as ( N = ma + nb ) for some non-negative integers ( m ) and ( n ). 8. **Conclusion:** Since ( b ) is a sum of elements of ( A ), and ( a ) is an element of ( A ), any sufficiently large integer ( N ) can be written as a sum of elements of ( A ).

Therefore, we have: [ rsqrt{2} = r + (k - 8) ] Solving for ( r ): [ rsqrt{2} = r + (k - 8) implies r(sqrt{2} - 1) = k - 8 implies r = frac{k - 8}{sqrt{2} - 1} ] Using the identity ( sqrt{2} - 1 = frac{sqrt{2} + 1}{2} ), we simplify ( r ): [ r = (k - 8)(sqrt{2} + 1) = ksqrt{2} + k - 8sqrt{2} - 8 ] Thus, the radius of the circle is: [ boxed{r = ksqrt{2} + k - 8sqrt{2} - 8} ]"},{"prompt":"After learning about absolute values, we know that |a| represents the distance of the number a on the number line from the origin.

Since e^{x} > 0 for all x (as the exponential function is always positive), the sign of f'(x) depends solely on (x-2).

Put these 5 coins on the left pan. 3. Take 4 coins from the pointed bag and put them on the right pan. This will compare: [10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4] Where ( X ) represents the type of coin in the pointed bag. Depending on the result: - If the balance is equal, the pointed bag contains 12g coins. - If the right pan is heavier, the pointed bag contains coins heavier than 12g. - If the left pan is heavier, the pointed bag contains coins lighter than 12g. **Second weighing:** 1. If coins are heavier (13g or 14g): - Take 2 coins from each of the four other bags and place them on the left pan. - Take 7 coins from the pointed bag and place them on the right pan. This compares: [2(10 + 11 + 12 + 13) = 7 times X] Where ( X ) represents the unknown coin type in the pointed bag. Calculate the exact weights: [2(10 + 11 + 12 + 13) = 92] For 14g: [7 times 14 = 98] For 13g: [7 times 13 = 91] If the left pan is heavier, the pointed bag contains 14g coins. If the right pan is heavier, it contains 13g coins. 2. If coins are lighter (10g or 11g): - Compare 10g with a similar method used in part (a). If after the first weighing it is deduced that the coins are 11g, re-verify using the first step of (a).

Since ( V_1 ) is not illuminated by a lantern directly placed at ( V_1 ), none of these ( n-1 ) corridors will be illuminated unless lanterns are placed at every other vertex connected to ( V_1 ).

First, we analyze the term log _{2}a=0.5^{a}=0.2^{b}: - Since log _{2}a represents the power to which 2 must be raised to obtain a, and 0.5 = frac{1}{2}, we can see that log _{2}a = 0.5^{a} implies a relationship between a and a power of 2. - Given that 0.5^{a} = 0.2^{b}, and knowing that 0.5 = frac{1}{2} and 0.2 = frac{1}{5}, we can infer a relationship between the powers of frac{1}{2} and frac{1}{5}. From log _{2}a > 0, we deduce that a > 1. This is because the logarithm of a number greater than 1 to a base greater than 1 is positive. Next, we define a function f(x) = (frac{1}{2})^{x} - log _{2}x and analyze its behavior. We find that f(x) is decreasing on the interval (0, +infty). This is inferred from the properties of the functions involved and their derivatives. Given that f(1) = frac{1}{2} > 0 and f(2) = frac{1}{4} - 1 < 0, we conclude that there is a unique zero of f(x) in the interval (1,2). This means that a, which satisfies the equation 0.5^{a} = log _{2}a, must lie within the interval (1,2). Since a in (1,2), it follows that 0.5^{a} in (frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}). Consequently, 0.2^{b} in (frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}) as well, because 0.5^{a} = 0.2^{b}. From the inequality {(frac{1}{5})}^{b} > frac{1}{4} > frac{1}{5}, we deduce that b < 1. This is because as the base frac{1}{5} is raised to higher powers, the result becomes smaller, and to be greater than frac{1}{4}, b must be less than 1. Therefore, we have established that b < 1 < a.

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Understanding Small Differences**: - We need to show that values close to zero can be realized by the differences ( n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} ). - Consider ( n, m ) such that ( n ) is significantly larger than ( m ). For simplicity, consider ( m = n-1 ). - We have: [ n^{1/3} - (n-1)^{1/3} ] 2. **Estimating ( n^{1/3} - (n-1)^{1/3} )**: - Use the binomial approximation for small ( x ): [ (n-1)^{1/3} = n^{1/3} left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^{1/3} ] - For large ( n ), (left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^{1/3}) can be approximated as: [ left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^{1/3} approx 1 - frac{1}{3n} ] - Thus: [ n^{1/3} - (n-1)^{1/3} approx n^{1/3} - n^{1/3} left(1 - frac{1}{3n} right) = n^{1/3} left( frac{1}{3n} right) = frac{1}{3n^{2/3}} ] 3. **Generalizing Differences**: - For any two large integers ( n ) and ( m ), ( n > m ), we use the mean value theorem: [ n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} approx frac{d}{dx} x^{1/3} cdot (n - m) = frac{1}{3} x^{-2/3} cdot (n - m) ] - Choosing ( x ) roughly halfway between ( n ) and ( m ): [ x approx frac{n + m}{2} ] - So: [ n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} approx frac{1}{3} left( frac{n + m}{2} right)^{-2/3} (n - m) ] 4. **Denseness in Reals**: - Since we can approximate any small value with differences like (frac{1}{3n^{2/3}}), which can be made arbitrarily small as ( n ) increases. - If (alpha) is an arbitrary real number, because the differences ({ n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} }) form a dense set, we can get arbitrarily close to (alpha). 5. **Approaching (sqrt{2})**: - If we specifically want a difference that is close to (sqrt{2}), we can approximate (frac{k}{j}), where ( j ) is a large integer. We know values of the form (frac{1}{3n^{2/3}}) can form such approximations: ( k approx sqrt{2} cdot n^{2/3} ) - By finding sufficiently large ( n ), we approximate (sqrt{2}). By carefully choosing ( n ) and ( m ), the values ( n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} ) will converge to any desired value, hence forming a dense set in reals. The conclusion is that we can indeed find a subsequence of ({ n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} : n, m = 0, 1, 2, ldots }) which converges to (sqrt{2}).

Since each school must have at least one volunteer, we first assign one volunteer to each school. This leaves us with 2 volunteers to be freely distributed among the 3 schools. The problem now becomes how to distribute 2 indistinguishable volunteers into 3 distinguishable schools, which can be solved by the stars and bars method. We represent the volunteers as stars (*) and use 2 bars (|) to divide them into 3 groups (schools). For example, \\"*|*| \\" means one volunteer goes to the first school, one to the second, and none to the third. There are 4 positions to place the stars and bars, and we need to choose 2 positions out of these 4 to place the bars. This can be done in binom{4}{2} = 6 ways. However, this calculation assumes that each school can receive any number of volunteers, including zero, which contradicts our initial condition that each school must receive at least one volunteer. To correct for this, we consider the initial distribution of one volunteer to each school. The remaining distribution methods can be categorized into three types based on which school receives the additional two volunteers: 1. Both additional volunteers go to the same school. There are 3 ways to choose which school receives the two volunteers. 2. Each of the remaining two volunteers goes to a different school. There are no ways to do this since it would result in each school having more than one volunteer from the start, leaving no volunteers to distribute. 3. One school receives one additional volunteer, and another school receives the other. There are binom{3}{2} = 3 ways to choose which two schools receive one additional volunteer each. Therefore, the total number of different assignment methods is 3 + 3 = boxed{6}. However, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the calculation.

We start by noting that the sequence ( a_n ) is strictly increasing and consists of natural numbers. We are given the inequality ( a_n leq n + 2020 ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). 2.

For the sake of contradiction, assume there exists some ( i in mathbb{N} ) such that ( a_i > i ). 4. From the divisibility condition, we have: [ a_{n+1} mid (n^3 a_n - 1) ] This implies that ( gcd(a_{n+1}, n) = 1 ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). This is because if ( a_{n+1} ) shared a common factor with ( n ), it would not divide ( n^3 a_n - 1 ) cleanly. 5. Now, consider a number ( j ) such that ( 2021! mid j ) and ( j > i ). Since ( 2021! ) is the factorial of 2021, it contains all prime factors up to 2021. Therefore, ( gcd(j, j+t) > 1 ) for all ( 2 leq t leq 2021 ). 6. Since the sequence ( a_n ) is strictly increasing and ( a_i > i ), and ( j > i ), we have ( a_{j+1} > j+1 ). Given the inequality ( a_n leq n + 2020 ), we have: [ j + 2 leq a_{j+1} leq j + 2021 ] 7. However, from step 4, we know that ( gcd(a_{j+1}, j) = 1 ). But from step 5, we have ( gcd(j, j+t) > 1 ) for all ( 2 leq t leq 2021 ). This creates a contradiction because ( a_{j+1} ) must lie within the range ( [j+2, j+2021] ) and must share a common factor with ( j ). 8. Therefore, our assumption that there exists some ( i in mathbb{N} ) such that ( a_i > i ) must be false. Hence, ( a_n leq n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). 9.

This means that there are no four points on the circle such that all six segments joining these points have lengths greater than ( sqrt{2} ). 3. **Contradiction Argument**: - Suppose, for contradiction, that there exist four points ( A, B, C, D ) on the unit circle such that all segments ( AB, BC, CD, DA, AC, BD ) have lengths greater than ( sqrt{2} ). - The length of a chord in a unit circle is given by ( 2 sin(theta/2) ), where ( theta ) is the central angle subtended by the chord. - For a chord to have length greater than ( sqrt{2} ), the central angle ( theta ) must satisfy ( 2 sin(theta/2) > sqrt{2} ). Solving this inequality, we get ( theta > frac{pi}{2} ). 4. **Angle Sum Argument**: - If ( A, B, C, D ) are four points on the unit circle, the sum of the central angles subtended by these points must be ( 2pi ). - However, if each of the four central angles ( angle AOB, angle BOC, angle COD, angle DOA ) is greater than ( frac{pi}{2} ), their sum would be greater than ( 2pi ), which is a contradiction. 5. **Application of Turan's Theorem**: - Since ( G ) is ( K_4 )-free, we can apply Turan's theorem. Turan's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a ( K_4 )-free graph with ( n ) vertices is ( frac{n^2}{3} ). - Therefore, the number of segments with length greater than ( sqrt{2} ) is at most ( frac{n^2}{3} ).

For instance, extend side (a) and side (e) (which is directly opposite to (a) across the octagon). 5. **Equating the Extended Rectangles**: - The sides of the resulting rectangles can be expressed in terms of the lengths (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h). For example, look at the two sides forming part of the rectangle: [ text{Length of one side of the rectangle} = a + frac{b + h}{2} ] [ text{Length of the opposite rectangle side} = e + frac{d + f}{2} ] 6. **Equality by Irrational Root**: - Assume opposite sides are not equal (e.g., (a neq e)).

When x>0, regardless of the value of alpha, y will be positive because any positive number raised to a power is positive. This means the graph will pass through the first quadrant. 2. When x<0, and alpha is a positive integer, if alpha is even, then y will be positive since a negative number to an even power is positive. This would place the graph in the second quadrant.

Substituting y = cos x into the equation of each circle: - **Circle A**: [ (x - 0)^2 + (cos x - 0)^2 = 2^2 ] - **Circle B**: [ (x - 0)^2 + (cos x - 1)^2 = 1^2 ] - **Circle C**: [ (x - 2)^2 + (cos x - 0)^2 = 0.5^2 ] - **Circle D**: [ (x - pi)^2 + (cos x - 0)^2 = 2^2 ] 2. Analyzing the chances of multiple intersections: - The cosine function also oscillates between -1 and 1 similar to sine but phases shifted. It has infinite peaks and troughs as x to pm infty. - **Circle A and D** with radius 2 are likely to encompass more oscillations of cosine function. In particular, Circle D, positioned at the center (pi, 0), results in aligning peaks of cosine function around odd multiples of pi and troughs around even multiples of pi within its radius for more intersections. - **Circle B and C**, due to their smaller radii and differently placed centers, would have fewer intersection points, especially Circle C which due to a smaller radius and being displaced from the origin will have minimal effects. Conclusion: Circle D, centered at (pi,0) with radius 2, is most likely to have the maximum number of intersections with the graph of y=cos x because it can effectively cover more peaks and troughs of the cosine function within its radius.

This point must be the circumcenter of the polygon, which is not a vertex, leading to a contradiction. 8. **Adjacent unselected points**: If there are no adjacent unselected points, then there must be exactly one selected point between any two unselected points.

Therefore, the maximum possible value (M) for any of these diagonals is: [ M = 3 ] 3. **Minimum Value (m):** - Since the hexagon is convex, all internal angles are less than (180^circ). This implies that the shortest distance between any two non-adjacent vertices (i.e., the diagonals) must be at least 1. - To see why, consider the diagonal (AD). Since (A) and (D) are not adjacent, the shortest path between them in a convex hexagon is a straight line, which must be at least 1 unit long. - Therefore, the minimum possible value (m) for any of these diagonals is: [ m = 1 ] 4. **Conclusion:** - The range of the possible values for the diagonals (AD), (BE), and (CF) is from 1 to 3.

In this case, (d) is the greatest common divisor of (D), and (dmathbb{Z} = {dn : n in mathbb{Z}}). - Define the function (f: mathbb{Z} rightarrow dmathbb{Z}) by (f(n) = dn). This function is clearly a bijection because for every integer (n), there is a unique integer (dn) in (dmathbb{Z}). - Additionally, (|f(n+1) - f(n)| = |d(n+1) - dn| = |d| in D). Thus, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement is true for any set (D) with (|D| = k-1). Let (D = {d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k}) with (|D| = k). - Let (md = gcd(d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{k-1})) and (nd = d_k). Then, (d = gcd(md, nd) = gcd(md, d_k)). - Since (d = gcd(md, nd)), we have (gcd(m, n) = 1). 3. **Constructing the Bijection:** - By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a bijection (g: mathbb{Z} rightarrow mdmathbb{Z}) such that (|g(n+1) - g(n)| in {d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{k-1}}). - Consider an infinite grid (q(x, y)) where (0 le x le m-1) and (y in mathbb{Z}). Define (q(0, t) = g(t)) for (t in mathbb{Z}) and (q(x, y) = q(x-1, y) + nd) for all (x, y in mathbb{Z}) with (1 le x le m-1). 4. **Ensuring Bijection:** - Every multiple of (d) is listed exactly once in the columns (x = 0, 1, ldots, m-1) because they form (mdmathbb{Z} + {0, nd, 2nd, ldots, (m-1)nd}). - Since (gcd(m, n) = 1), the multiples of (d) are distributed uniquely across the columns. If a multiple of (d) appeared twice, it would imply a contradiction in the bijection (g). 5. **Defining the Function (f):** - We can define (f) by traversing the grid in a zigzag manner. For example, start at ((0, 0)), move to ((0, 1)), and continue to ((0, m-1)), then move to ((1, m-1)), and so on. - This traversal ensures that (|f(n+1) - f(n)|) is either (d_k) (when moving between columns) or one of ({d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{k-1}}) (when moving within a column). 6. **Conclusion:** - By induction, we have shown that for any non-empty subset (D) of positive integers, there exists a bijection (f: mathbb{Z} rightarrow dmathbb{Z}) such that (|f(n+1) - f(n)| in D) for every integer (n).

To solve this problem, we will use the concept of parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" signs. 1. **Count the number of \\"-\\" signs in each row and column**: - First row: 2 \\"-\\" signs (\\"+\\" - \\"+\\" - \\"+\\"). - Second row: 0 \\"-\\" signs (\\"+++ +\\"). - Third row: 0 \\"-\\" signs (\\"+++ +\\"). - Fourth row: 2 \\"-\\" signs (\\"+\\" - \\"+\\" - \\"+\\"). - First column: 4 \\"+\\" signs. - Second column: 0 \\"+\\" signs (All are \\"+\\"). - Third column: 0 \\"+\\" signs (All are \\"+\\"). - Fourth column: 4 \\"+\\" signs. 2. **Consider the parity of the number of \\"-\\" signs**: - In the initial grid, the number of \\"-\\" signs is even in each row: - first row: even (2) - second row: even (0) - third row: even (0) - fourth row: even (2) - Similarly, examine the initial count of \\"-\\" signs for each column: - first column: even (0) - second column: even (0) - third column: even (0) - fourth column: even (0) 3. **Effect of flipping a row or column**: - Flipping a row or a column will change the parity of the number of \\"-\\" signs in that specific row or column: - If a row has an even number of \\"-\\", flipping it will make the parity odd. - If a row has an odd number of \\"-\\", flipping it will make the parity even. - Since initially every row and every column has an even number of \\"-\\" signs, any single flip operation will introduce an odd number of \\"-\\" signs in the flipped row or column. 4. **Goal of converting all signs to \\"+\\"**: - To turn the entire grid into \\"+\\", there must be 0 \\"-\\" signs left, which is an even number. - However, every operation flips signs and thus changes the parity of the row or column (from even to odd or odd to even). Given the initial even parity and the fact that flipping changes parity, the task would always leave some entries with an odd parity. 5. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the parity, we see it is not possible to turn all the signs to \\"+\\" by any number of allowable moves of flipping entire rows or columns since doing so will disturb the parity in such a way that achieving all \\"++\\" becomes impossible.

According to group theory, to verify that a set with a binary operation is a group, it must satisfy four criteria: closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility. 8. **Closure**: Any composition of two permutations within the set results in another permutation within the set. For example: [ p_2 cdot p_3 = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 2 & 3 & 1 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 3 & 1 & 2 end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 2 & 1 & 3 end{pmatrix} = p_6 ] 9. **Associativity**: For any permutations p_i, p_j, p_k in the set, the composition satisfies: [ (p_i cdot p_j) cdot p_k = p_i cdot (p_j cdot p_k) ] 10. **Identity Element**: The permutation p_1 acts as the identity element since: [ p_1 cdot p_i = p_i cdot p_1 = p_i quad text{for any } i ] 11. **Invertibility**: Each permutation has an inverse permutation that when composed with it results in the identity permutation. For example, the inverse of p_2 is p_3 since: [ p_2 cdot p_3 = p_3 cdot p_2 = p_1 ] 12. Therefore, the set of permutations {p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6} under composition forms a group. # Conclusion: [ boxed{{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6}} ]"},{"prompt":"Evaluate the product 3^{frac{1}{2}} cdot 9^{frac{1}{4}} cdot 27^{frac{1}{8}} cdot 81^{frac{1}{16}} dotsm.","completion":"First, express each term as a power of 3: [ 3^{frac{1}{2}} cdot 9^{frac{1}{4}} cdot 27^{frac{1}{8}} cdot 81^{frac{1}{16}} dotsm = 3^{frac{1}{2}} cdot 3^{2 cdot frac{1}{4}} cdot 3^{3 cdot frac{1}{8}} cdot 3^{4 cdot frac{1}{16}} dotsm. ] Combine the exponents as follows: [ 3^{frac{1}{2} + 2 cdot frac{1}{4} + 3 cdot frac{1}{8} + 4 cdot frac{1}{16} + dotsb}. ] Let [ S = frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{4} + frac{3}{8} + frac{4}{16} + dotsb. ] Calculating S using a similar approach: [ 2S = 1 + frac{2}{2} + frac{3}{4} + frac{4}{8} + dotsb. ] Subtracting gives: [ S - (frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{8} + dotsb) = 1 implies S - 1 = 1 implies S = 2. ] Therefore, [ 3^{frac{1}{2} + 2 cdot frac{1}{4} + 3 cdot frac{1}{8} + 4 cdot frac{1}{16} + dotsb} = 3^2 = boxed{9}. ] Conclusion: After proper calculation, the sum of the series results in an exponent of 2, meaning the product simplifies to 3^2 = 9."},{"prompt":"What is the value of (3^1 2 + 6^2 1)^0 times 4? textbf{(A)} 1qquadtextbf{(B)} 2qquadtextbf{(C)} 3qquadtextbf{(D)} 4qquadtextbf{(E)} 5","completion":"1. **Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses**: [ 3^1 - 2 + 6^2 - 1 ] - (3^1 = 3) because any number raised to the power of 1 is the number itself. - (6^2 = 36) because squaring 6 gives 36. - Therefore, the expression simplifies to: [ 3 - 2 + 36 - 1 = 36 ] 2. **Apply the exponent of (0) to the result**: [ 36^0 ] - Any nonzero number raised to the power of 0 is 1, hence: [ 36^0 = 1 ] 3. **Multiply by 4**: [ 1 times 4 ] - Multiplying (1) by 4 gives: [ 1 times 4 = 4 ] 4. **Conclude with the final answer**: [ 4 ] The final answer is boxed{textbf{(D)} 4}"},{"prompt":"Lynne chooses four distinct digits from 1 to 9 and arranges them to form the 24 possible fourdigit numbers.

Speed in meters per minute = Speed in km/hr * (1000 meters / 1 km) * (1 hour / 60 minutes) Speed in meters per minute = 54 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 60) Speed in meters per minute = 54 * 1000 / 60 Speed in meters per minute = 54000 / 60 Speed in meters per minute = 900 meters/minute Now, we know that the train crosses the platform in one minute. The distance covered by the train in one minute is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the platform as P meters. Distance covered in one minute = Length of the train + Length of the platform 900 meters = 450 meters + P meters Now, we can solve for P: P = 900 meters - 450 meters P = 450 meters So, the length of the platform is also 450 meters.

Given angles 135^circ adjacent to the smaller base suggest the sides adjacent to a are equal, hence the trapezoid is isosceles. 3. **Equal sides and angle relations**: - Since the trapezoid is isosceles and a = 1 dm, the equal sides make the angle at the non-parallel sides symmetric. - Given angles are 135^circ, the remaining angles at the larger base are 180^circ - 135^circ = 45^circ each. 4. **Upper base calculation**: - The upper base b is equal to the radius of the circumcircle, which is also given. To calculate this, note that b equals the radius r of the circumscribed circle. - Since one specific angle of 150^circ between diagonals implies geometric symmetry, a suitable calculation involving trigonometric projection gives the radius r. 5. **Relevant geometric relationships**: - As noted, the upper base b = sqrt{3} dm follows from the geometric symmetry involving the inscribed angles. 6. **Height calculation**: - Projection of one leg using angle.

Since all values of x in this interval will make f(x) < dfrac{8}{3} true (because x itself will be less than 2 and thus less than dfrac{8}{3}), the inequality holds for all x < 2. For x geq 2, the function is defined as f(x) = x - dfrac{1}{x}. We solve the inequality x - dfrac{1}{x} < dfrac{8}{3}. To solve it, first multiply through by x to avoid the fraction: x^2 - 1 < dfrac{8}{3}x. Now move all terms to one side to form a quadratic inequality: x^2 - dfrac{8}{3} x + 1 < 0. Next, we find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation x^2 - dfrac{8}{3} x + 1 = 0. It might be factored or require quadratic formula to solve, but let's first try to factor: (x - dfrac{1}{3})(x - 3) = 0. From this, we get the roots x = dfrac{1}{3} and x = 3. Now, test the intervals determined by these roots to see where the inequality holds (a sign chart or test points can be used here). Since we're looking for x geq 2, we're only interested in the interval between 2 and 3 anyway, as the root x = dfrac{1}{3} is not within our domain of interest.

For instance, if all the cells are colored white, then there will be no equilibrium cells. 2. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Equilibrium Cells:** - Cells on the edge of the board (excluding corners) cannot be equilibrium cells because they have an odd number (three) of neighbors. The total number of such edge cells is calculated as follows: [ text{Number of edge cells} = 4 times 98 = 392 ] - The remaining inner cells can potentially be made equilibrium cells. This is notably possible with a striped coloring pattern.

We know the numbers 0 and 9608 are reachable. 4. **Prove All Numbers from 0 to 9608 are Reachable:** - Start with a white board (0 equilibrium cells) and gradually color it into a striped pattern (9608 equilibrium cells). Each step in coloring affects only the equilibrium status of neighboring cells. - Thus, if a change affects up to 4 equilibrium cells at a time, then every intermediate number (from 0 to 9608) is achievable by either incrementing or decrementing steps by 1, 2, or 3 equilibrium cells. 5. **Intermediate Result Proof:** - If a number ( r leq 5000 ) is reachable, then the numbers ( r + 1 ), ( r + 2 ), and ( r + 3 ) are also reachable. This is because, in a board with abundant white cells, we can place two blue cells so that they share one white cell as required (Figure (b)), incrementing the number of equilibrium cells. - Conversely, if a number ( r geq 5000 ) is reachable, then the numbers ( r - 1 ), ( r - 2 ), and ( r - 3 ) are also reachable. This is done by converting cells along a predominantly blue stripe to decrease the number of equilibrium cells by selectively repainting some cells white (Figure (c)). 6. **Final Conclusion:** From the assertion above, it follows that: [ text{All numbers from 0 to 5000 are reachable} quad text{(Assertion 1)} ] [ text{All numbers from 5000 to 9608 are reachable} quad text{(Assertion 2)} ] Therefore, all numbers from 0 to 9608 are reachable.

The equation of the tangent line can be written in the form y=mx+c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. Since we know the slope is 4 and the line passes through the point (1, 2) (since y=1^3+1=2 at x=1), we can substitute these values to find c. Substituting x=1 and y=2 into y=4x+c, we get 2=4(1)+c, which simplifies to c=-2. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y=4x-2. To find the points where this line intersects the coordinate axes, we set y=0 to find the x-intercept and x=0 to find the y-intercept. Setting y=0 gives 0=4x-2, which solves to x=frac{1}{2}. So, the x-intercept is (frac{1}{2}, 0). Setting x=0 gives y=-2, so the y-intercept is (0, -2).

Denote the velocities of the ants by v_1, v_2, ldots, v_n, where these velocities can have different directions. Consider an example scenario: - For (v_{i-1} < v_i > v_{i+1}), ant (i) would catch up with ants (i-1) or (i+1), leading to an infinite number of collisions under certain circumstances. 3. **Velocity Ordering Cases:** Thus, for the number of collisions to be finite, the velocity order can be in the following configurations (up to direction change): - Case (i): ( v_1 geq v_2 geq cdots geq v_n ) - Case (ii): ( v_1 geq v_2 geq cdots geq v_{k-1} > v_k leq v_{k+1} leq cdots leq v_n ), for some ( k in {2,ldots,n-1} ). 4. **Collision Claim:** We need the following crucial observation: **Claim:** If ( v_1 geq v_2 geq cdots geq v_m ), then ants (m-1) and (m) collide at most ( m-1 ) times. **Proof of the Claim:** - We use induction on m: - **Base Case:** For ( m = 1 ), there are no collisions, as there’s only one ant. - **Inductive Step:** Assume for some ( m geq 2 ) that ants ( m-2 ) and ( m-1 ) collide at most ( m-2 ) times. - Since ( v_{m-1} geq v_m ), ants (m-1) and (m) will only collide if ( m-1 ) is moving towards ( m ). - Between successive collisions with ant ( m ), ant ( m-1 ) must change its direction by colliding with ant ( m-2 ). - By the inductive hypothesis, ants ( m-1 ) and ( m-2 ) collide at most ( m-2 ) times. - Therefore, ants ( m ) and ( m-1 ) collide at most ( (m-2) + 1 = m-1 ) times. 5. **Summing Collisions in Case (i):** - For ( v_1 geq v_2 geq cdots geq v_n ): - The total number of collisions is bounded by the sum of individual collision counts: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + (n-1) = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] 6. **Analyzing Case (ii):** - Let ( k ) be where ( v_1 geq v_2 geq cdots geq v_{k-1} > v_k leq cdots leq v_n ). - Apply the claim both to the first (k) ants and the last ( n-k+1 ) ants: [ S = frac{k(k-1)}{2} + frac{(n-k+1)(n-k)}{2} ] - Simplifying, we get: [ S = frac{n(n-1)}{2} - (k-1)(n-k) ] - Notice ( S < frac{n(n-1)}{2} ). 7. **Achievability and Conclusion:** - Place ants at positions ( x = 1, 2, ldots, n ) with speeds ( v_1 = cdots = v_{n-1} = 1 ) and ( v_n = varepsilon ) (very small varepsilon > 0). - In this arrangement, the collisions happen at a maximum of ( 1 + 2 + cdots + (n-1) ) = ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ).

To find the total marks scored by all 3 boys, we multiply the average by 3: Total marks = Average mark * Number of boys Total marks = 432 * 3 Total marks = 1296 Now, we can find Chetan's score by subtracting Amar's and Bhavan's scores from the total marks: Chetan's score = Total marks - (Amar's score + Bhavan's score) Chetan's score = 1296 - (576 + 324) Chetan's score = 1296 - 900 Chetan's score = 396 Now, to find the percentage that Chetan scored, we divide his score by the maximum score and multiply by 100: Chetan's percentage = (Chetan's score / Maximum score) * 100 Chetan's percentage = (396 / 900) * 100 Now, let's calculate the percentage: Chetan's percentage = (396 / 900) * 100 Chetan's percentage = 0.44 * 100 Chetan's percentage = 44% Therefore, Chetan scored boxed{44} percent in the exam."},{"prompt":"The function ( f(x) = cos 2x 2sqrt{3} sin x cos x ) has the smallest positive period determined.","completion":"Given the function ( f(x) = cos 2x - 2sqrt{3} sin x cos x ), we aim to determine its minimum positive period. 1. **Simplify the given function**: [ f(x) = cos 2x - 2sqrt{3} sin x cos x ] 2. **Apply the double angle identities**: Recall that (sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x), therefore: [ f(x) = cos 2x - sqrt{3} sin 2x ] 3. **Combine the terms using a single cosine function**: We use the identity for combining different cosine and sine terms into a single cosine function: [ a cos theta + b sin theta = R cos (theta - phi) ] where ( R = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ) and (tan phi = frac{b}{a} ).

Adding 1 to this product results in another integer because the set of integers is also closed under addition. Therefore, if x is an integer, 2x+1 is necessarily an integer. This confirms the sufficiency of the condition. 2. **Necessity**: To test if the condition is necessary, we examine if 2x+1 being an integer implies that x must be an integer. Consider x=frac{1}{2}. In this case, 2x+1 = 2*frac{1}{2} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, which is an integer. However, x=frac{1}{2} is not an integer. This example demonstrates that x does not have to be an integer for 2x+1 to be an integer, thus showing that the condition is not necessary. Based on the analysis: - The condition \\"x is an integer\\" is sufficient for \\"2x+1 is an integer\\" because if x is an integer, then 2x+1 is always an integer. - The condition is not necessary because 2x+1 being an integer does not imply that x must be an integer, as shown by the counterexample x=frac{1}{2}.

Consider the following identities: [ left(a + frac{1}{a}right)^5 = a^5 + frac{1}{a^5} + 5left(a^3 + frac{1}{a^3}right) + 10left(a + frac{1}{a}right) ] [ left(a + frac{1}{a}right)^3 = a^3 + frac{1}{a^3} + 3left(a + frac{1}{a}right) ] 5. Substituting the expression ( a^3 + frac{1}{a^3} ) from the second equation into the first equation, we get: [ left(a + frac{1}{a}right)^5 = a^5 + frac{1}{a^5} + 5left(a + frac{1}{a}right)^3 - 5left(a + frac{1}{a}right) ] 6. Knowing that ( a^5 = 2 + sqrt{3} ) and ( b^5 = 2 - sqrt{3} ), we have ( a^5 + b^5 = (2 + sqrt{3}) + (2 - sqrt{3}) = 4 ). Consequently, substituting ( a^5 + b^5 ) into the equation gives: [ x^5 = 4 + 5(x^3 - 3x) + 10x ] 7.

There are binom{6}{4} ways to draw 4 cards from 6, and binom{4}{4} ways to draw 4 cards from the 4 red cards. Therefore, the total number of ways to draw the cards with at least one blue card is binom{6}{4} - binom{4}{4} = 15 - 1 = 14. Thus, the answer is boxed{14}.

Since the numbers must be arranged in a row, we consider the permutations of these numbers. For the combination {1, 2, 3, 4}, there are 4! = 24 permutations. For the combination {1, 2, 2, 4}, since there are two identical numbers (2s), the number of distinct arrangements is frac{4!}{2!} = 12. However, considering that the 2 can come from either a red or a blue card, we need to double the number of arrangements for the {1, 2, 2, 4} combination, resulting in 12 times 2 = 24 arrangements. Therefore, the total number of different arrangements is 24 + 24 = 48. However, this calculation has an error in considering the doubling for the {1, 2, 2, 4} combination, as the correct approach should not involve doubling this count.

For point B, substituting x=0 into the equation 2x - 3y + 6 = 0 gives -3y + 6 = 0, so y = 2. Thus, B has coordinates (0, 2). 2. Now that we have the coordinates of points A, B, and O (which is the origin, (0, 0)), we can find the area of triangle AOB. The formula for the area of a triangle given the coordinates of its vertices is: S = frac{1}{2} cdot |x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)| where (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), and (x_3, y_3) are the coordinates of the vertices. 3. Substituting the coordinates of A, B, and O into the formula gives: S = frac{1}{2} cdot |-3(2 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - 2)| = frac{1}{2} cdot |-6| = 3 Therefore, the area of triangle AOB is boxed{3}."},{"prompt":"lida went to Minewaska Sate Park one day this summer.

For triangle ABC, we have a=6, b=8, and c=10. The semi-perimeter s is frac{a+b+c}{2} = 12, so the area of the triangle K can be calculated using Heron's formula: K = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = sqrt{12 times 6 times 4 times 2} = 24. Therefore, the radius of the circumscribed sphere (which is also the radius of the given sphere) is R = frac{abc}{4K} = frac{6 times 8 times 10}{4 times 24} = 13. The distance from the center of the sphere to plane ABC is the difference between the radius of the sphere and the radius of the circumscribed sphere of the triangle, which is 0. However, considering the Pythagorean theorem from the center of the sphere to the vertices of the triangle and its orthocenter, we find the actual distance to be sqrt{R^2 - frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{9}} = sqrt{13^2 - frac{6^2+8^2+10^2}{9}} = 12. Therefore, the distance from the center of the sphere to plane ABC is boxed{12}.

Given that the radius of the sphere is 13 and the distance from the center of the sphere to plane ABC is 12 (from part 1), the tangent of the acute angle is frac{text{opposite}}{text{adjacent}} = frac{12}{5}.

First, when the graph is translated frac{pi}{4} units to the right, the function becomes y = sin(2(x - frac{pi}{4})).

Next, when the graph is translated 1 unit up, the function becomes y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin 2x - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos 2x + 1. To make the answer choices more comparable to our transformed function, we can use the double angle identity cos 2x = 1 - 2 sin^2 x. Now, let's substitute cos 2x in the transformed function: y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin 2x - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (1 - 2 sin^2 x) + 1 Simplifying, we get: y = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin 2x - frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + sqrt{2} sin^2 x + 1 Now let's compare this to the answer choices.

It is predicted that in April, 20,000 people will choose option 1, 10,000 people will choose option 2, and 10,000 people will choose option 3. In order to increase revenue, the ticket prices are adjusted. It is found that when the prices of options 1 and 2 remain unchanged, for every 1 yuan decrease in the price of the combined ticket (option 3), 400 people who originally planned to buy tickets for attraction A only and 600 people who originally planned to buy tickets for attraction B only will switch to buying the combined ticket.

For every 1 yuan decrease in the price of the combined ticket, 400 people switch to the combined ticket. Therefore, the decrease in the number of people choosing Option 1 is 400 times 5 = 2000. Thus, the new number of people choosing Option 1 is 20,000 - 2000 = 18,000 people, or 1.8 thousand people. - **Option 2 (Attraction B only):** The initial number of people choosing this option is 10,000. For every 1 yuan decrease, 600 people switch to the combined ticket. Therefore, the decrease in the number of people choosing Option 2 is 600 times 5 = 3000. Thus, the new number of people choosing Option 2 is 10,000 - 3000 = 7000 people, or 0.7 thousand people. - **Option 3 (Combined ticket):** The initial number of people choosing this option is 10,000. The increase in the number of people choosing Option 3 due to the price decrease is 400 times 5 + 600 times 5 = 2000 + 3000 = 5000. Thus, the new number of people choosing Option 3 is 10,000 + 5000 = 15,000 people, or 1.5 thousand people. - **Total Revenue:** The total revenue is calculated as follows: 1.8 times 30 + 0.7 times 50 + (70 - 5) times 1.5 = 54 + 35 + 97.5 = 186.5 (tens of thousands of yuan). Therefore, the answers are: 1.8, 0.7, 1.5 thousand people, and the total ticket revenue will be boxed{186.5} thousand yuan. Part 2: - **Functional Relationship:** Given the changes in the number of people for each option and the price adjustments, the total revenue w in tens of thousands of yuan can be expressed as a function of x, the decrease in yuan for the combined ticket: w = 30(2 - 0.04x) + 50(1 - 0.06x) + (70 - x)(1 + 0.04x + 0.06x) Simplifying, we get: w = -0.1x^2 + 1.8x + 180 This can be rewritten as: w = -0.1(x - 9)^2 + 188.1 - **Maximum Revenue:** Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-0.1 < 0), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum value. The maximum value of w occurs when x = 9. Substituting x = 9 into the equation, we find the maximum revenue to be 188.1 (tens of thousands of yuan). At this point, the price of the combined ticket is 70 - 9 = 61 yuan. Therefore, the total ticket revenue in April is maximized when the price of the combined ticket is boxed{61} yuan, and the maximum value is boxed{188.1} thousand yuan."},{"prompt":"Ellen made smoothies in the blender.

The first scenario can happen in 3 ways (choosing which color will have two cards), and the second scenario does not apply because we need all three colors to be present. 2. **Choose the Letters**: After choosing the colors, we need to choose different letters for each card. Since we are drawing four cards and each must have a different letter, there are C(5,4) = 5 ways to choose the letters for the cards. 3. **Combine the Choices**: For each way of choosing the colors, there are 5 ways to choose the letters. Therefore, the total number of different ways to draw the cards is 3 times 5 times 5 times 5 = 375. However, this calculation includes the scenario where all four cards could be of the same color, which is not allowed by the problem statement. We need to adjust our calculation to exclude this possibility. 4. **Correct Calculation**: The correct way to calculate this is to consider that we have three colors and we want to choose three cards, each of a different color, and then choose a fourth card which can be of any of the three colors but must have a different letter from the first three. This gives us C(3,1) times C(5,1)^3 times C(3,1) = 3 times 125 times 3 = 375. However, upon reviewing, we realize that the correct approach is to consider the combinations of colors and letters more carefully. 5. **Final Calculation**: The correct calculation involves choosing two cards of the same color and two cards of different colors, ensuring all three colors are represented, and then choosing different letters for each card. The correct number of combinations is therefore 3 times C(5,2) times C(5,1) times C(5,1) = 3 times 10 times 5 times 5 = 750. However, this still does not match any of the given options, indicating a mistake in the calculation process. 6. **Reevaluation and Correct Answer**: After reevaluating the process, the correct approach is to choose two cards of one color and one card each of the other two colors, ensuring all three colors are represented, and then choosing different letters for each card. The correct formula for calculating the combinations is 3 times C(5,2) times C(5,1) times C(5,1) = 3 times 10 times 5 times 5 = 750. However, this calculation still seems to be incorrect as it does not align with the options provided. 7. **Final Correction and Answer**: The correct approach is to realize that the initial interpretation of the problem was incorrect. The correct interpretation should focus on the requirement for all three colors to be present and for the letters to be different.

In this standard form, the eccentricity e is given by the formula e = sqrt{1 + frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}}. We can match coefficients from the given hyperbola equation to the standard form, which results in: - a^{2} = 3 (since frac{x^{2}}{3} is in the equation) - -b^{2} = -m or b^{2} = m (since - frac{y^{2}}{m} is in the equation) Since the eccentricity e is given as 2, we have: e = sqrt{1 + frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}} = 2. We can then square both sides to eliminate the square root: e^2 = 1 + frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}} Rightarrow 4 = 1 + frac{m}{3}. Solving for m: 4 = 1 + frac{m}{3} Rightarrow 4 - 1 = frac{m}{3} Rightarrow 3 = frac{m}{3} Rightarrow m = 9. However, we must consider that in the original equation we have -frac{y^{2}}{m}. For a hyperbola centered at the origin with horizontal transverse axis, the y^2 term must have a negative coefficient. Thus, m must be negative, which leads us to reconsider our equation to solve for m: 4 = 1 - frac{m}{3}. Now, solving for m: 4 - 1 = -frac{m}{3} Rightarrow 3 = -frac{m}{3} Rightarrow m = -9.

Can it happen that for some dimensions of the board, the number of cells of one color is two more than that of another color?","completion":": 1. Let the dimensions of the rectangular board be ( n times m ). 2. First, we start by investigating a strip of the board that is ( 3 times 1 ) (3 rows by 1 column). In this strip, there are exactly three cells, and each cell will be colored differently according to the coloring rule. Therefore, in any strip of size ( 3k times 1 ), where ( k ) is an integer, colors will appear evenly distributed. 3. Now let’s consider the general horizontal and vertical distribution of cells. We denote ( n = 3t + r ) and ( m = 3s + q ), where ( t ) and ( s ) are integers, and ( r ) and ( q ) are the remainders from division by 3. This helps in breaking the problem down to more manageable sections. 4. We can model the distribution of cells across the entire ( n times m ) board by considering pieces where the number of cells not divisible by 3 in both dimensions is analyzed. 5. Begin by slicing a ( 3t times m ) section from the board. In this section, the colors distribute evenly because 3 rows ensure each vertical strip of 1 cell contains each of the three colors uniformly. Thus, the remaining section of the board is ( r times m ). 6. Next, from the remaining ( r times m ) grid, slice a piece of ( r times 3s ). In this smaller section, the colors still distribute evenly since 3 columns guarantee each row of 1 cell contains each of the three colors uniformly. The remaining section after this cut is ( r times q ). 7. Now consider the ( r times q ) section (remaining unsliced part). Note that there are specific configurations for ( r ) and ( q ) because they are remainders when divided by 3. The possible remainders (0, 1, 2) generate a finite number of configurations for the remaining board section: - **Case (1):** If ( r = 0 ) and ( q = 0 ), no cells are left. Thus, every cell on the original ( n times m ) board has ( frac{nm}{3} ) cells of each color. - **Case (2):** If ( r = 1 ) and ( q = 2 ), the remaining part is a ( 1 times 2 ) rectangle, in which one color is missing. - **Case (3):** If ( r = 2 ) and ( q = 2 ), the remaining part is a ( 2 times 2 ) square, with an imbalance of only one cell from each color. 8. In every possible configuration of the remaining section: - When nothing remains (Case 1), cells are evenly distributed. - When a ( 1 times 2 ) rectangle remains (Case 2), only two colors are represented, each by one cell less compared to the other color. - When a ( 2 times 2 ) square remains (Case 3), one color will have one more cell than the other two. 9. Thus, in each of these cases, we can infer that the maximum possible disparity in the color count within the cells is exactly one. Conclusion: It is impossible to have a scenario where the number of cells of one color is exactly two more than the number of cells of another color. The maximum disparity in colors on a rectangular board painted in this manner is always 1 cell.

Therefore, applying the definition of conditional probability for P(A|B), we get: [ P(A|B) = frac{P(AB)}{P(B)} = frac{P(A)P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A) ] Hence, given the conditions, P(A|B) = P(A), proving Option C correct. - **Option D: Correctness Verification** The sample correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables on a scatterplot. The value of r ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear correlation, 0 indicates no linear correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive linear correlation. Therefore, the closer the absolute value of r is to 1, the stronger the linear correlation between the paired sample data. This makes the statement in Option D correct.

In the first week, Karthik read 7/13th of the book, so he read (7/13) * P pages. The remaining pages after the first week would be P - (7/13) * P = (13/13) * P - (7/13) * P = (6/13) * P. In the second week, Karthik read 5/9th of the remaining book, so he read (5/9) * (6/13) * P pages.

Prove that the grid breaks into no more than 2018 pieces. Two pieces that share only vertex points are considered disconnected.","completion":"1. Consider a 70 times 70 board, which contains 70 cdot 70 = 4900 cells. 2. The problem states that 2018 cells are removed from the board. Therefore, the number of cells remaining is: [ 4900 - 2018 = 2882 ] 3. We need to prove that the resulting board does not break into more than 2018 pieces. We define two cells to be connected if they share a common side. If we imagine each cut effectively disconnecting the board along the sides of the removed cells, each removed cell increases the number of pieces potentially. 4. To start, visualize the entire board as one large piece before cutting. This piece can be thought of as a giant loop or cycle that encompasses all 4900 cells of the 70 times 70 board. 5. Let’s construct a cycle that passes over each cell exactly once such that all adjacent cells in the cycle have a common side. One way to track this cycle could be: - Traverse all cells in the first column from bottom to top. - After reaching the top, continue with the second column, but move from top to bottom. - Continue this zigzag pattern until all cells are covered. - Finally, exit the last cell of the last column, and retrace the steps back to the starting cell if needed. 6. Now, considering removing cells: when we remove a cell, we are essentially cutting our constructed loop. However, observe the following: - Cutting one cell influences the single loop but does not affect other remaining cells beyond their direct relation to the cycle they are part of. 7. Each removal can split a single contiguous segment potentially into two parts (if it severs a bridge, or path, within the cycle). Hence, in the worst scenario, each removed cell could increase the number of segments (or pieces) by at most one. 8. Since each of the 2018 removed cells can contribute to creating a new segment from the original connected cycle, the number of segments (or pieces) is bounded by the number of removed pieces plus the original piece: [ 1 + 2018 = 2019 ] 9. Thus, taking the original piece and the 2018 pieces we potentially cannot form more fragments than the number of cuts made. # Conclusion: The board could be divided into parts, but not more than 2018 parts. Thus, we have shown that removing 2018 cells from a 70 times 70 board results in no more than 2018 disconnected pieces.

Then a_1 = x, a_2 = 3000, and begin{align*} a_3 &= frac{a_2 + 2}{a_1} = frac{3002}{x}, a_4 &= frac{a_3 + 2}{a_2} = frac{3002/x + 2}{3000} = frac{x + 3002}{3000x}, a_5 &= frac{(x + 3002)/(3000x) + 2}{3002/x} = frac{x + 2}{3000}, a_6 &= frac{(x + 2)/3000 + 2}{(x + 3002)/(3000x)} = x, a_7 &= frac{x + 2}{(x + 2)/3000} = 3000. end{align*} Since a_6 = a_1 and a_7 = a_2, and each term depends only on the previous two terms, the sequence becomes periodic from this point, with period 5. Therefore, the first five terms represent all possible values. We explore the potential cases: 1. We can have a_1 = x = 3001. 2. We can have a_3 = frac{3002}{x} = 3001, which leads to [x = frac{3002}{3001}.] 3. We can have a_4 = frac{x + 3002}{3000x} = 3001, which leads to [x = frac{3002}{9000001}.] 4. We can have a_5 = frac{x + 2}{3000} = 3001, which leads to [x = 9000002.] Hence, there are 4 different possible values of x. Conclusion: The problem is valid and we have identified all possible cases where the sequence contains the term 3001.

Therefore, the total sales for these 11 months would be 11A. The sales total for December is given as 2 times the average of these 11 months, so the sales for December would be 2A. The total sales for the year would be the sum of the sales for January through November plus the sales for December, which is 11A + 2A = 13A. The fraction of the sales total for December out of the total sales for the year would be the sales for December divided by the total sales for the year: Fraction for December = Sales for December / Total sales for the year Fraction for December = 2A / 13A Since A is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, it cancels out, leaving us with: Fraction for December = 2 / 13 So, the sales total for December was boxed{2/13} of the sales total for the year."},{"prompt":"f there are exactly two distinct points on the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}(r gt 0) such that the distance to the line 4x3y+25=0 is equal to 1, then the range of the radius r is ______.","completion":"To find the range of the radius r for which there are exactly two distinct points on the circle x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}(r gt 0) at a distance of 1 from the line 4x-3y+25=0, we follow these steps: 1. **Calculate the distance from the center of the circle to the line:** The center of the circle is at (0,0). The distance d from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by the formula d=frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. For the center of the circle (0,0) and the line 4x-3y+25=0, this distance is: [ d = frac{|4(0)-3(0)+25|}{sqrt{4^2+(-3)^2}} = frac{25}{sqrt{16+9}} = frac{25}{sqrt{25}} = 5. ] 2. **Determine the conditions for exactly two distinct points:** For there to be exactly two distinct points on the circle at a distance of 1 from the line, the radius of the circle must be such that it is 1 unit away from the line at two points. This means the radius r must be either 1 unit less than the distance from the center to the line (d-1) or 1 unit more (d+1). Since d=5, we have r=4 or r=6 for the case where there is exactly one point at the boundary conditions. 3. **Find the range of r for exactly two distinct points:** Since r=4 and r=6 represent the boundary conditions where there is exactly one point on the circle at a distance of 1 from the line, for there to be exactly two distinct points, r must be strictly between 4 and 6.

We begin by fixing the position of a red chip in the top-left corner (due to the symmetry of the problem, this choice does not reduce the generality). Step 1: Placing the First Red Chip Place one red chip in the top-left corner. This is arbitrary but helps simplify symmetry considerations. Step 2: Analyzing Adjacent Placements For the adjacent top-center, center-left, and diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) positions, we cannot place another red chip. Assume top-center is blue and center-left is green. Given this starting configuration, there are remaining positions for: - 3 red chips, 3 blue chips, and 3 green chips. Step 3: Avoiding Continuation of a Color Line Further assume that no uninterrupted line (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) should form with any color. Now, analyzing possible placements needs careful counting to prevent any two identical colors from touching. Since there are numerous possible configurations to consider and we want no uninterrupted color lines, starting from the initial configuration, and for simplicity, systematically fill the rows and columns by alternating the colors, taking care not to form a straight line of any single color. Step 4: Calculating Configurations Given the adjacency and uninterrupted line rules, manually iterate potential arrangements or use a backtracking algorithm.

First, let's calculate the circumference of a full circle using the formula: Circumference (C) = 2 * π * radius Given that the radius (r) is 14 cm, the circumference of the full circle would be: C = 2 * π * 14 cm C = 28π cm Since we only need half of the circumference for the semicircle, we divide it by 2: Half Circumference = 28π cm / 2 Half Circumference = 14π cm Now, let's calculate the diameter of the semicircle, which is twice the radius: Diameter (d) = 2 * radius Diameter = 2 * 14 cm Diameter = 28 cm Finally, we add the half circumference and the diameter to get the perimeter of the semicircle: Perimeter = Half Circumference + Diameter Perimeter = 14π cm + 28 cm The perimeter of the semicircle is 14π + 28 cm. If you want to get a numerical value, you can approximate π as 3.14: Perimeter ≈ 14 * 3.14 cm + 28 cm Perimeter ≈ 43.96 cm + 28 cm Perimeter ≈ 71.96 cm So, the perimeter of the semicircle is approximately boxed{71.96} cm."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=x^{2}+bx whose graph passes through the point (1,2), let a_{n}= frac {1}{f(n)}.

So her senior year allowance would be: Senior year allowance = 10x + 5 We are given that the percentage increase in Kathleen's weekly allowance is 150%. The percentage increase is calculated based on the original amount, so we can set up the following equation: Percentage increase = [(Senior year allowance - Middle school allowance) / Middle school allowance] * 100% 150% = [((10x + 5) - 10) / 10] * 100% 1.5 = (10x + 5 - 10) / 10 1.5 = (10x - 5) / 10 Now, we multiply both sides by 10 to solve for x: 1.5 * 10 = 10x - 5 15 = 10x - 5 Now, we add 5 to both sides to isolate the term with x: 15 + 5 = 10x 20 = 10x Now, we divide both sides by 10 to solve for x: 20 / 10 = x x = 2 Therefore, the multiple of her middle school allowance that her senior year allowance was more than is boxed{2} ."},{"prompt":"A direction vector of line l is overrightarrow{nu} = (4, 4), and its intersection with the yaxis is at point (0, 4).

From the given information, we can determine that the equation of line l is y = -x - 4. Let's take the midpoint A of MN. Then overrightarrow{OM} cdot overrightarrow{ON} = |overrightarrow{OA}|^2 - 4. By calculating the minimum value of |overrightarrow{OA}|^2, we can find the required answer. First, we know that the direction vector of line l is overrightarrow{nu} = (4, -4), so its slope is -1. Since the line intersects the y-axis at point (0, -4), the equation of line l is: y = -x - 4 Now, let's take the midpoint A of MN. Using the dot product formula, we have: overrightarrow{OM} cdot overrightarrow{ON} = |overrightarrow{OM}| |overrightarrow{ON}| cos{theta} = frac{|overrightarrow{OM}|^2 + |overrightarrow{ON}|^2 - |MN|^2}{2} = frac{1}{2}left(|overrightarrow{OM}|^2 + |overrightarrow{ON}|^2right) - 8 Since |overrightarrow{OM}|^2 + |overrightarrow{ON}|^2 = 2|overrightarrow{OA}|^2 + 2|overrightarrow{AN}|^2, we can rewrite the dot product formula as: overrightarrow{OM} cdot overrightarrow{ON} = |overrightarrow{OA}|^2 + 4 - 8 = |overrightarrow{OA}|^2 - 4 To minimize the dot product, we need to minimize |overrightarrow{OA}|^2. The smallest possible value of |overrightarrow{OA}|^2 is achieved when A lies on the line l.

We need to prove that if one of the given conditions is satisfied, then the remaining two are also satisfied. This essentially shows the existence of a circle tangent to the lines AB, BC, CD, and DA with its center outside the quadrilateral ABCD. **Step 1:** Given any one of the conditions, show how the other two follow. Case 1: ( |AD| + |DC| = |AB| + |BC| ) 1. Assume ( |AD| + |DC| = |AB| + |BC| ). 2. By the triangle inequality applied to triangles formed by lines AD, BC and their extensions: - ( |AK| + |KC| = |AL| + |LC| ) - ( |BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL| ). 3. Now, in triangle Delta AKC and Delta ALC: [ AK + KC = AL + LC ] Since ( |AD| + |DC| = |AB| + |BC| ), K and L are fixed, and the segments are tangents to a circle. 4. Similarly, for Delta BKD and Delta BLD: [ BK + DK = BL + DL ] Thus, if ( |AD| + |DC| = |AB| + |BC| ), then ( |AK| + |KC| = |AL| + |LC| ) and ( |BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL| ). Case 2: ( |AK| + |CK| = |AL| + |CL| ) 1. Assume ( |AK| + |CK| = |AL| + |CL| ). 2. Apply it to the extension lines' properties, resulting in the equality in positioning: - Thus, from the configuration, we must have: [ |BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL| ] 3. Additionally, we deduce: - ( |AK| + |CK| ) reframes the sum: [ |AD| + |DC| quad text{(geometric symmetry via the circle centered outside)} = |AB| + |BC| ] 3. Hence, if ( |AK| + |CK| = |AL| + |CL| ), then ( |AD| + |DC| = |AB| + |BC| ) and ( |BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL| ). Case 3: ( |BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL| ) 1. Assume ( |BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL| ). 2. Again, following the triangle relations on the figure: - By argument of similar structure: [ |AK| + |KC| quad text{(concludes symmetric relations)} = |AL| + |LC| ] 3. Finally, demonstrate through: - Sum symmetry relation as fixed: [ |AD| + |DC| = |AB| + |BC| ] Thus, if ( |BK| + |DK| = |BL| + |DL| ), then ( |AD| + |DC| = |AB| + |BC| ) and (| AK| + |CK| = |AL| + |CL|). **Conclusion:** Hence, each condition ensures the others' validity.
