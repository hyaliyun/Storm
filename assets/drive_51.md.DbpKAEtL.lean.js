Let ( O ) represent the total weight of the onions, and ( C ) represent the total weight of the carrots. Then: [ C = 2O ] Since one bag contains turnip, the total weight of the onions and carrots will be: [ 106 - T ] where ( T ) is the weight of the bag with the turnip.

Since ( 3O ) must be a whole number, ( 106 - T ) must be divisible by 3. To find possible values for ( T ), let's check the divisibility of ( 106 - T ) by 3 for each possible weight ( T ) of the bag containing turnip: - If ( T = 13 ): [ 106 - 13 = 93 quad text{and} quad 93 div 3 = 31 quad (text{is an integer}) ] - If ( T = 15 ): [ 106 - 15 = 91 quad text{and} quad 91 div 3 neq text{integer} ] - If ( T = 16 ): [ 106 - 16 = 90 quad text{and} quad 90 div 3 = 30 quad (text{is an integer}) ] - If ( T = 17 ): [ 106 - 17 = 89 quad text{and} quad 89 div 3 neq text{integer} ] - If ( T = 21 ): [ 106 - 21 = 85 quad text{and} quad 85 div 3 neq text{integer} ] - If ( T = 24 ): [ 106 - 24 = 82 quad text{and} quad 82 div 3 neq text{integer} ] 4.

We need to determine the smallest distance ( d ) such that the photographer can capture all the cyclists within a segment of the track. 1. **Assumption on Speeds and Directions:** - Without loss of generality, assume all cyclists move counterclockwise. - Let ( v_1, v_2, ) and ( v_3 ) be the speeds of the first, second, and third cyclists respectively, where ( v_1 > v_2 > v_3 ). 2. **Relative Motion Analysis:** - Consider the relative positions of the cyclists in a reference frame moving with the second cyclist. - In this reference frame, the second cyclist is stationary at point ( A ) on the track. - The first cyclist appears to move with speed ( v_1 - v_2 ) counterclockwise, and the third cyclist with speed ( v_2 - v_3 ) clockwise. 3. **Meeting Points:** - The cyclists periodically meet each other. Let ( B_1, B_2, B_3, ldots ) denote these meeting points from the start. - Moving in mutually exclusive directions and distinct speeds ensures they meet at distinct points and intervals. 4. **Segment Length Analysis:** - Denote by ( beta_n ) the smaller arc between successive meeting points ( B_n ) and ( B_{n+1} ). - The length of ( beta_n ) is at most half the track length, i.e., ( 150 ) meters. 5. **Cyclic Coverage and Containment:** - The arcs ( beta_n ) together span the entire circumference over multiple overlaps due to periodic meetings. - Thus, one of these arcs ( beta_m ) must contain point ( A ). - Either segment ( B_m ) to ( A ) or ( A ) to ( B_{m+1} ) is guaranteed to be at most ( 75 ) meters in length. 6. **Conclusion:** - Periodic meetings ensure that two cyclists cover the segment formed with the second cyclist within ( 75 ) meters.

(2) Calculate the average score and variance of Team B. (3) Given that the variance of Team A's scores is 1.4, the team with neater scores is ______.","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: To find the median score of Team A, we first arrange the scores in ascending order: 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. The median is the average of the 5th and 6th scores, which are 9 and 10 respectively. Therefore, the median score of Team A is: frac{9 + 10}{2} = 9.5 text{ points} For Team B, we observe the frequency of each score. The score 10 appears 4 times, which is more frequent than any other score. Hence, the mode of Team B's scores is 10 points. Thus, the median score of Team A is 9.5 points, and the mode of Team B is 10 points. So, the answers are: boxed{9.5 text{ and } 10} Part 2: To calculate the average score of Team B, we sum all scores and divide by the number of scores: text{Average} = frac{1}{10} times (10 times 4 + 8 times 2 + 7 + 9 times 3) = frac{1}{10} times 90 = 9 To find the variance, we calculate the squared difference from the mean for each score, sum these values, and then divide by the number of scores: text{Variance} = frac{1}{10} times [4 times (10-9)^2 + 2 times (8-9)^2 + (7-9)^2 + 3 times (9-9)^2] = frac{1}{10} times 4 = 1 Therefore, the average score of Team B is 9, and the variance is 1. So, the answers are: boxed{9 text{ and } 1} Part 3: Given the variance of Team A's scores is 1.4 and the variance of Team B's scores is 1, the team with neater (more consistent) scores is the one with the lower variance.

If a^{2}b^{2}=3bc and sin C=2sin B, then A=______.","completion":"To solve for angle A in triangle triangle ABC given a^{2}-b^{2}=3bc and sin C=2sin B, we proceed as follows: 1. **Using the given ratio of sines:** Given sin C=2sin B, we apply the Law of Sines, which states frac{a}{sin A}=frac{b}{sin B}=frac{c}{sin C}. From sin C=2sin B, it follows that c=2b because the sides of the triangle are proportional to the sines of their opposite angles. 2. **Substituting c=2b into the given equation:** We have a^{2}-b^{2}=3bc. Substituting c=2b into this equation yields a^{2}-b^{2}=3b(2b), which simplifies to a^{2}-b^{2}=6b^{2}. 3. **Simplifying the equation:** From a^{2}-b^{2}=6b^{2}, we can further simplify to a^{2}=7b^{2} by adding b^{2} to both sides of the equation. 4. **Applying the Law of Cosines to find cos A:** The Law of Cosines states a^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2bccos A. Substituting a^{2}=7b^{2} and c=2b into this formula, we get 7b^{2}=b^{2}+4b^{2}-2b(2b)cos A. Simplifying this gives cos A=frac{b^{2}+4b^{2}-7b^{2}}{4b^{2}}=frac{-2b^{2}}{4b^{2}}=-frac{1}{2}. 5. **Determining the value of A:** Since cos A=-frac{1}{2}, and knowing that the cosine of 120^{circ} is -frac{1}{2}, we conclude that A=120^{circ}.

This is because: - A positive slope (k > 0) ensures that as x increases, y also increases. - A non-negative y-intercept (b geq 0) ensures that the line either touches or is above the x-axis. Therefore, we have left{begin{array}{l}k>0 bgeq 0end{array}right.. 2. **Analyzing the relationship between x_{1} and x_{2}**: - Given x_{1} > x_{2}, and knowing the slope of the line is positive (k > 0), we can deduce the relationship between y_{1} and y_{2}. - Since k > 0, an increase in x leads to an increase in y. Therefore, if x_{1} > x_{2}, it logically follows that y_{1} > y_{2}. 3. **Conclusion**: - Based on the above analysis, we conclude that when x_{1} > x_{2} for points A and B lying on the line y=kx+b (with kneq 0) and the line not passing through the fourth quadrant, the relationship between y_{1} and y_{2} is y_{1} > y_{2}.

Because the diagonals AD, BE, and CF are all diameters, the segments OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, and OF are all equal to the radius of the circle. 4.

If each person contributes 7 coins, and there is a shortage of 4 coins, it means the total amount collected with 7 coins per person falls short of the price of the item by 4 coins. This can be represented as 7x + 4. Given these conditions, we equate the two scenarios to find the relationship between the number of people and the price of the item.

Then, the gain when the article is sold for Rs. 320 is G + 12% of G, which can be written as G + 0.12G = 1.12G.

For the first bill: The original amount is 200. The simple interest rate is 10% per month. Since it's 2 months overdue, the interest for each month would be 10% of 200, which is 20. So, the total interest for 2 months would be 20 * 2 = 40. Therefore, the total amount owed for the first bill is 200 + 40 = 240. For the third bill: The original amount is not given, but we know the late fees. The late fee for the first month is 40. The late fee for the second month is twice that, so 40 * 2 = 80. Therefore, the total late fees for the third bill are 40 + 80 = 120. Now, let's calculate the total amount owed without the second bill: Total owed = 1234 (total) - 240 (first bill) - 120 (third bill) = 874.

The original amount for the second bill is 130. The total late fees for 6 months would be 6x. So, the equation for the second bill is: 130 (original amount) + 6x (late fees) = 874 (total amount owed for the second bill). Now, let's solve for x: 6x = 874 - 130 6x = 744 x = 744 / 6 x = 124.

This means that his share after spending on drinks is his original share minus the amount spent on drinks: ( frac{3}{4}X - frac{1}{5}X = 132 ) To solve for ( X ), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 20.

Now, let's calculate how many fish each fisherman caught in the 40 minutes they fished together. Since 40 minutes is 2/3 of an hour, we'll multiply their hourly catch rate by 2/3 to find out how many fish they caught in 40 minutes: Mike caught 30 * (2/3) = 20 fish in 40 minutes.

Area of the door = height * width = 6 feet * 3 feet = 18 square feet Area of one window = height * width = 4 feet * 3 feet = 12 square feet Since there are three windows, we multiply the area of one window by three: Area of three windows = 3 * 12 square feet = 36 square feet Now, we subtract the area of the door and windows from the total wall area: Total area to be white washed = Total wall area - (Area of door + Area of three windows) = 960 square feet - (18 square feet + 36 square feet) = 960 square feet - 54 square feet = 906 square feet Finally, we calculate the cost of white washing at Rs. 4 per square foot: Cost of white washing = Total area to be white washed * cost per square foot = 906 square feet * Rs. 4 per square foot = Rs. 3624 Therefore, the cost of white washing the four walls of the room is Rs. boxed{3624} ."},{"prompt":"As shown in the figure, in the isosceles trapezoid (ABCD) where (AB parallel CD), (AB = 2CD), and (angle A = 60^{circ}), point (E) is on the base (AB) such that (FE = FB = AC) and (FA = AB).

Let these parallelograms be denoted as P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n. 2. **Area of the Polygon**: The area of the polygon mathcal{P} is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms that tile it.

How many miles was the trip?","completion":"To calculate the total distance of the trip, we need to determine the total driving time and then multiply it by the constant speed. First, let's calculate the total number of breaks they took during the trip. Since they took a break every 5 hours, we divide the total time spent (50 hours) by the time between breaks (5 hours): Total breaks = Total time / Time between breaks Total breaks = 50 hours / 5 hours Total breaks = 10 breaks However, since they reached their destination after 50 hours, they would have taken their last break at the 45-hour mark. So, they actually took one less break: Actual breaks taken = Total breaks - 1 Actual breaks taken = 10 - 1 Actual breaks taken = 9 breaks Each break was 30 minutes long, so the total break time in hours is: Total break time (in hours) = Number of breaks × Break duration (in hours) Total break time (in hours) = 9 breaks × 0.5 hours/break Total break time (in hours) = 4.5 hours Now, we need to subtract the total break time and the time spent looking for the hotel from the total trip time to find the actual driving time: Actual driving time = Total time - Total break time - Hotel search time Actual driving time = 50 hours - 4.5 hours - 0.5 hours Actual driving time = 45 hours Finally, we can calculate the total distance of the trip by multiplying the actual driving time by the constant speed: Total distance = Actual driving time × Speed Total distance = 45 hours × 62 miles/hour Total distance = 2790 miles Therefore, the trip was boxed{2790} miles long."},{"prompt":"The product of 58 times 41 is closest to the estimated product of which of the following calculations?

This is because the path must move ( n-1 ) steps up and ( k-1 ) steps to the right, totaling ( n + k - 2 ) steps. 3. **Total Number of Borders:** - The total number of borders that can be placed on the board is ( n(k-1) + k(n-1) ). This is because: - There are ( n ) rows, each with ( k-1 ) horizontal borders. - There are ( k ) columns, each with ( n-1 ) vertical borders. - Simplifying, we get: [ n(k-1) + k(n-1) = nk - n + kn - k = 2nk - n - k ] 4. **Parity Consideration:** - We need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of borders. - The total number of borders modulo 2 is: [ (n(k-1) + k(n-1)) mod 2 = (nk - n + kn - k) mod 2 = (2nk - n - k) mod 2 ] - Since ( 2nk ) is always even, we have: [ (2nk - n - k) mod 2 = (n + k) mod 2 ] 5. **Determining the Winning Strategy:** - If ( n + k ) is even, then the total number of borders is even. - If ( n + k ) is odd, then the total number of borders is odd. - The game ends when there are no more valid moves, i.e., when the last border is placed. - If ( n + k ) is even, the first player (Pasha) will place the last border. - If ( n + k ) is odd, the second player (Vova) will place the last border. 6. **Conclusion:** - The player who places the last border loses because they will block the path from the bottom left to the top right cell. - Therefore, if ( n + k ) is even, the second player (Vova) wins. - If ( n + k ) is odd, the first player (Pasha) wins.

Solving for ( k ), we get: [ k = 2009^n - n - 1. ] 5. Since ( 2009^n ) is a positive integer and ( n ) is a positive integer, ( k ) will also be a positive integer.

Given that the ratio of the areas of the top and bottom faces is 1:16, we can write the equation for the areas as frac{{a}^{2}}{{b}^{2}}=frac{1}{16}. This implies that b=4a, since if we take the square root of both sides, we get frac{a}{b}=frac{1}{4}. The height of the prism, h, is three times the length of the side of the top face, which gives us h=3a meters. The volume V of the prism is given by the area of the base times the height. The base area is a trapezoid formed by the top and bottom faces and their respective sides. The formula for the volume of the prism, considering the trapezoidal base, is V=frac{1}{3}⋅h⋅(a^{2}+sqrt{a^{2}⋅16a^{2}}+16a^{2}). Substituting h=3a and simplifying, we have: [567m^{3} = frac{1}{3}⋅3a⋅(a^{2}+sqrt{a^{2}⋅16a^{2}}+16a^{2})] Solving this equation for a, we find that a=3m. Consequently, since b=4a, we find that b=12m. The height of the prism is therefore h=9m. To calculate the surface area, we need to consider the areas of the top and bottom faces and the lateral faces. The lateral faces are trapezoids, and the height of these trapezoids can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, considering the height of the prism and the difference in the side lengths of the top and bottom faces. The height of the trapezoid on the lateral face is sqrt{h^{2}+left(frac{b-a}{2}right)^{2}} = sqrt{9^{2}+left(frac{12-3}{2}right)^{2}} = frac{9sqrt{5}}{2}.

Finally, we calculate the probability based on these numbers. 1. **Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 3 ones and 2 zeros in a row is the number of permutations of 5 items where 3 are of one kind and 2 are of another kind. This can be calculated as the total permutations of 5 items, which is 5! = 120. 2. **Arrangements with Zeros Together**: When the 2 zeros are grouped together, we can consider them as a single item. Then, we have 4 items to arrange: the group of zeros and the 3 ones. The number of ways to arrange these 4 items is 4! = 24. Since the 2 zeros within their group can also switch places, we multiply by the number of arrangements of these 2 zeros, which is 2! = 2. Thus, the total number of arrangements where the 2 zeros are together is 2 times 4! = 48. 3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that the 2 zeros are not adjacent is the complement of the probability that they are adjacent. Therefore, we subtract the fraction of arrangements where the zeros are together from 1: [P = 1 - frac{2 times 4!}{5!} = 1 - frac{48}{120} = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6] Therefore, the probability that the 2 zeros are not adjacent is boxed{0.6}, which corresponds to choice boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"Given a positive geometric series {a_n} satisfying a_2 + a_4 = 3 and a_3 cdot a_5 = 2, find the common ratio q of the series.","completion":"Since {a_n} is a positive geometric series that satisfies a_2 + a_4 = 3 and a_3 cdot a_5 = 2, We have the following system of equations: begin{cases} a_1q + a_1q^3 = 3 a_1q^2 cdot a_1q^4 = 2 end{cases} Given that q > 0, we can simplify the equations as follows: From the first equation: a_1q(1 + q^2) = 3 From the second equation (using properties of geometric series): (a_1q^2) cdot (a_1q^4) = (a_1^2q^6) = 2 Taking the square root of the second equation gives us: a_1q^3 = sqrt{2} Substituting the expression for a_1q^3 into the first equation: a_1q + sqrt{2} = 3 Solving for a_1q: a_1q = 3 - sqrt{2} Now, multiply both sides by q^2 (to use substitution for a_1q^3): (3 - sqrt{2}) cdot q^2 = sqrt{2} Solve for q: q^2 = frac{sqrt{2}}{3 - sqrt{2}} Rationalizing the denominator, we get: q^2 = frac {sqrt{2} (3 + sqrt{2})}{(3 - sqrt{2})(3 + sqrt{2})} q^2 = frac {3sqrt{2} + 2}{7} Taking the square root of both sides: q = boxed{sqrt{frac{3sqrt{2} + 2}{7}}}"},{"prompt":"6 cdot 11n is a positive integer.

Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of jogger Relative speed = 12.5 m/s - 2.5 m/s = 10 m/s The train takes 37 seconds to pass the jogger. During this time, the train covers the distance to catch up with the jogger (250 m) plus the entire length of the train. Let's denote the length of the train as L (in meters). The total distance covered by the train while passing the jogger is the sum of the distance to catch up (250 m) and the length of the train (L). Total distance covered by train = 250 m + L Since distance = speed * time, we can use the relative speed and the time taken to pass the jogger to find the total distance covered by the train. Total distance covered by train = Relative speed * Time taken to pass 250 m + L = 10 m/s * 37 s 250 m + L = 370 m Now, we can solve for L: L = 370 m - 250 m L = 120 m Therefore, the length of the train is boxed{120} meters."},{"prompt":"hopkeeper sells 20 % of his stock at 10 % profit ans sells the remaining at a loss of 5 % . he incurred an overall loss of rs . 400 . find the total worth of the stock ?","completion":"Let's assume the total worth of the stock is Rs. X. According to the problem, the shopkeeper sells 20% of his stock at a 10% profit. So, the worth of the stock sold at a profit is 0.20X, and the profit from this part of the stock is 0.10 * 0.20X = 0.02X. The remaining stock, which is 80% of the total stock, is sold at a 5% loss. So, the worth of the stock sold at a loss is 0.80X, and the loss from this part of the stock is 0.05 * 0.80X = 0.04X. The overall loss is the loss from the 80% stock minus the profit from the 20% stock, which is given as Rs. 400.

Pat's parents invested 8000 in a long term bond that pays a certain interest rate, compounded annually. The approximate total amount of investment 36 years later, when Pat is ready for college, is 32000. What is the interest rate?","completion":"To find the interest rate, we can use the rule of 70, which is a way to estimate the number of years it takes for an investment to double at a given annual compound interest rate. The rule of 70 states that if you divide 70 by the annual interest rate, you get the approximate number of years it takes for the investment to double. In this case, we know that the investment doubles in approximately 70 years, so we can set up the equation: 70 / interest rate = 70 years Solving for the interest rate, we get: interest rate = 70 / 70 = 1 So the interest rate is approximately 1% per year. However, we also know that the investment amount of 8000 grows to 32000 in 36 years. To find the actual interest rate that would cause this growth, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r)^n Where: A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest P = the principal investment amount (8000 in this case) r = the annual interest rate (decimal) n = the number of years the money is invested (36 years in this case) We want to find r, and we know that A is 32000, P is 8000, and n is 36. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: 32000 = 8000(1 + r)^36 Dividing both sides by 8000, we get: 4 = (1 + r)^36 Now we need to find the 36th root of 4 to solve for r: (1 + r) = 4^(1/36) Using a calculator, we find that: 1 + r ≈ 1.0363 Subtracting 1 from both sides to isolate r, we get: r ≈ 0.0363 To express r as a percentage, we multiply by 100: r ≈ 0.0363 * 100 = 3.63% So the interest rate is approximately boxed{3.63%} per year."},{"prompt":"There are 24 multiples of 4 between a certain number and 112, inclusive.

According to the problem's diagram, connecting BA_1: AA_1 = 2 sin left(B + frac{A}{2}right) We can use trigonometric identities to simplify this: sinleft(B + frac{A}{2}right) = sinleft(B + frac{A}{2}right) = 2 cos frac{B - C}{2} 3.

Here, we need to show that no matter how the dominoes are placed, there will always be at least one grid line (either horizontal or vertical) that divides the entire chessboard into two parts without cutting through any domino. The key observation here is related to the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of grid lines intersecting with dominoes. The basic premise is that each domino covers exactly two adjacent squares on the chessboard. Here are the detailed steps to prove this: 1. **Domino Coverage**: - Each domino covers exactly 2 adjacent squares. - Since the chessboard is (6 times 6), there are a total of 36 squares. - Hence, to cover all the squares without any overlap, we need ( frac{36}{2} = 18 ) dominoes. This matches the given condition in the problem. 2. **Interaction With Grid Lines**: - Consider the grid lines of the chessboard, both horizontal and vertical. - There are 6 rows and 6 columns, so there are (6-1 = 5) horizontal and (6-1 = 5) vertical grid lines. - In total, there are (5 + 5 = 10) grid lines. 3. **Parity Argument**: - Each domino, when placed, either intersects a horizontal line or a vertical line or neither. - Suppose that every single one of these 10 grid lines intersects at least one domino. Then the number of intersections would be at least 20 because each domino intersects at most one horizontal or one vertical line, and each such line uniquely defines one domino. 4. **Contradiction**: - If every grid line intersected a domino, then we would have at least 20 such intersections. - However, we only have 18 dominoes, so at most 18 such intersections are possible. - This contradiction indicates that it is impossible for every grid line to intersect a domino. 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, there must be at least one grid line that does not intersect any domino. - This grid line can either be horizontal or vertical. When this grid line is identified, it naturally divides the chessboard into two separate parts, each containing an even number of squares, without cutting through any domino. Thus, we have shown that no matter how the dominoes are placed on the (6 times 6) chessboard, there will always be a grid line (either horizontal or vertical) that can divide the chessboard into two parts, without any domino being cut.

If 75% of the votes are likes and the remaining 25% are dislikes, then the number of like votes is 0.75x and the number of dislike votes is 0.25x. 2. **Set Up the Equation:** The net score S can be defined by subtracting the number of dislikes from the number of likes: [ S = 0.75x - 0.25x ] 3. **Simplify the Equation:** Combine the terms: [ S = 0.75x - 0.25x = 0.50x ] This means the score is 50% of the total votes, or frac{1}{2}x. 4. **Solve for x:** Given that the score S is 140: [ frac{1}{2}x = 140 ] Solving for x, we multiply both sides by 2: [ x = 140 times 2 = 280 ] 5. **Conclusion:** The total number of votes cast on Sangho's video is 280.

This means that when ( n ) is divided by 3, the remainder is 2. 2. **Bendeguz's Statement**: Bendeguz says that ( n ) is a triangular number. A triangular number can be expressed as: [ n = frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] for some integer ( k ). 3. **Cathy's Statement**: Cathy says that if ( s ) is the largest perfect square less than ( 2n ), then: [ 2n - s = 20 ] This implies: [ s = 2n - 20 ] Since ( s ) is a perfect square, let ( s = m^2 ) for some integer ( m ).

However, the specific values of a_1 and d are not necessary to solve this problem. The difference S_8 - S_3 represents the sum of terms a_4 through a_8, which is 5 terms in total. Since this is an arithmetic sequence, the sum of these 5 terms is equal to 10. Therefore, the average value of each term from a_4 to a_8 is frac{10}{5} = 2. To find S_{11}, we need to add the sum of the next three terms (a_9, a_{10}, and a_{11}) to S_8. Since the sequence is arithmetic and each of the next three terms will also have an average value of 2 (following the pattern established), the sum of these three terms is 3 times 2 = 6. Therefore, S_{11} = S_8 + 6.

A product is even if at least one of the numbers in the product is even. - Outcomes where the product is even: - On spinner C: The even numbers are 2, 4, 6. - On spinner D: The even numbers are 2, 4. We calculate the total number of scenarios (each possibility from C with each from D): - C has 6 outcomes and D has 4, so the total outcomes are 6 times 4 = 24. Next, calculate the number of even products: 1. If C lands on an even number (2, 4, 6), it does not matter what D lands on (the product will be even). - There are 3 choices on C and 4 choices on D, giving 3 times 4 = 12 scenarios. 2. If C lands on an odd number, D must land on an even number for the product to be even. - On C, the odd numbers are 1, 3, 5 (3 possibilities). - On D, the even numbers are 2, 4 (2 possibilities). - This gives 3 times 2 = 6 additional scenarios.

The conversion factor from kmph to m/s is: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 72 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 20 m/s Now, we know the train crosses the platform in 26 seconds at a speed of 20 m/s.

This is due to the fact that the maximum digit sum that can be added by Foma to ( a_{n-1} ) is 9.

We claim that (mathcal{A} = [-2, +infty)). 2. **Claim 1: All positive real numbers are in (mathcal{A})**: - Assume for contradiction that for some (C > 0), there exists a non-periodic sequence of integers ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) bounded from below that satisfies the given condition. - Given the first two terms of the sequence, the sequence is uniquely determined by [ a_{n+1} = -lfloor C a_n rfloor - a_{n-1}. ] - If there exist two different indices (i, j) such that (a_i = a_j) and (a_{i+1} = a_{j+1}), then the sequence is periodic. Hence, ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) is not bounded above. - Since the sequence is bounded below, there exists some constant (M) such that (a_n > M) for all (n geq 1). Since the sequence is not bounded above, there must exist (n geq 1) such that (a_n > frac{-2M}{C}). - Therefore, [ a_{n+1} = -lfloor C a_n rfloor - a_{n-1} < -leftlfloor C cdot frac{-2M}{C} rightrfloor - M = M, ] which contradicts the definition of (M). Hence, all positive real numbers are in (mathcal{A}). 3. **Claim 2: The only possible non-positive integer values of (mathcal{A}) are (-1) and (0)**: - If (C = 0), then (a_{n+1} = -a_{n-1}), and the sequence is clearly periodic. - If (C = -2), then every arithmetic progression satisfies the condition, so (-2 notin mathcal{A}). - If (C = -1), from the theory of linear recursions, we have [ a_n = P alpha^n + Q beta^n, ] where (alpha = frac{1}{2} + i frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = text{cis}(pi/3)) and (beta = frac{1}{2} - i frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) are the roots of the polynomial (x^2 - x + 1 = 0), and (P, Q) are complex constants. Since (beta = overline{alpha}) and (a_n in mathbb{R}), we must have (Q = overline{P}). Let (P = |P| text{cis}(theta)) for some (theta in mathbb{R}). Then, [ a_n = P alpha^n + overline{P} overline{alpha}^n = 2|P| cos left(theta + frac{npi}{3}right). ] So, (|a_n| < 2|P|), and as in the proof of Claim 1, ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) is periodic. - If (C < -2), from the theory of linear recursions, we have [ a_n = P alpha^n + Q beta^n, ] where (alpha) and (beta) are the roots of the polynomial (x^2 + xC + 1) (which in this case are real), and (P, Q in mathbb{R}). We also have (alpha + beta = -C > 2) and (alpha cdot beta = 1). Assuming without loss of generality that (alpha geq beta), we find (alpha > 1 > beta > 0). So, [ lim_{n to infty} a_n = pm infty, ] hence the sequence ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) is non-periodic. 4. **Claim 3: If (-1 < C < 0), then (C in mathcal{A})**: - Suppose for contradiction that for some (0 < k < 1), there exists a non-periodic sequence of integers ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) bounded from below that satisfies the given condition. As shown earlier, ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) cannot be bounded above. - Since the sequence is bounded below, let (M) be a constant such that (a_n > M) for all (n geq 1). Since the sequence is not bounded above, take (n) such that (a_n > frac{M}{k-1}). Then (a_{n+1} geq a_n) because otherwise, [ a_{n+2} = lceil k a_{n+1} rceil - a_n < lceil k a_n rceil - a_n leq 1 + a_n (k-1) < 1 + M, ] which contradicts the definition of (M). So, (a_{n+1} geq a_n > frac{M}{k-1}), and it follows by induction that ({a_i}_{i=n}^{infty}) is weakly increasing. Since the sequence is unbounded from above, for some (N), we must have (a_{n+1} geq a_n geq a_{n-1} > 0), which implies since (k < 1), [ a_n leq a_{n+1} = lceil k a_n rceil - a_{n-1} Rightarrow a_{n-1} leq lceil (k-1) a_n rceil leq 0, ] contradiction. So, done! 5. **Claim 4: If (C < -2), then (C notin mathcal{A})**: - We explicitly show a sequence that satisfies the conditions and is not periodic. Start at any (a_2, a_1) such that (a_2 > a_1 > 0). We claim that by induction (a_n geq a_{n-1} > 0) for all (n geq 2). For the step, we have [ a_{n+1} = lceil k a_n rceil - a_{n-1} geq 2 a_n - a_{n-1} Rightarrow a_{n+1} - a_n geq a_n - a_{n-1} geq 0 Rightarrow a_{n+1} geq a_n > 0. ] Then the sequence is weakly increasing; so if the sequence were periodic, all terms would be equal, which cannot happen since it starts with (a_2 > a_1). 6. **Claim 5: If (-2 < C < -1), then (C in mathcal{A})**: - Assume for contradiction that there exists a non-periodic sequence of integers ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) bounded from below such that [ a_{n+1} = lceil k a_n rceil - a_{n-1}, forall n geq 2, ] where (1 < k < 2) is a constant. - First, we claim that there exist infinitely many (t) such that (a_t < 0). Assume for contradiction that no, so that (a_n > 0) for all (n geq G) for some constant (G). We divide into two cases which both lead to contradiction: - **Case 1: If ({a_n}_{n geq G}) is not increasing**: - If (a_n < a_{n-1}) for some (n > G), we would have [ a_{n+1} = lceil k a_n rceil - a_{n-1} leq 2 a_n - a_{n-1} Rightarrow a_{n+1} - a_n leq a_n - a_{n-1} < 0 Rightarrow a_{n+1} < a_n. ] So, it follows by induction that (0 < a_i < a_{i-1}) for all (i geq n), which is clearly a contradiction. - **Case 2: If the sequence ({a_n}_{n geq G}) is increasing**: - Then (a_{n+1} geq a_n > 0) for all (n geq G), so that (a_{n+1} - a_n geq 0) for all (n geq G), and [ a_{n+1} = lceil k a_n rceil - a_{n-1} leq 2 a_n - a_{n-1} Rightarrow a_{n+1} - a_n leq a_n - a_{n-1}. ] So, the sequence ({a_{n+1} - a_n}_{n geq G}) is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers, so it is eventually constant, that is, ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) is eventually an arithmetic progression. That is, for some constant (H) and integers (p, q), we have (a_n = p + qn) for all (n geq H). Looking at the original equation, we have [ 0 leq p + q(n-1) - k(p + qn) + p + q(n+1) < 1 iff 0 leq (2 - k)(p + qn) < 1, forall n geq H. ] Since (2 - k ne 0), the only way that the above inequality can hold for all (n geq H) is if (q = 0), that is, the sequence is eventually constant, which is clearly a contradiction since the sequence should not be bounded from above. - So, indeed there must exist infinitely many (t) such that (a_t leq 0). Then, since the sequence ({a_n}_{n geq 1}) is bounded from below, it follows that there exists a constant (M) such that (a_n > M) for all (n geq 1); so if (a_t < 0), we must have [ a_{t+1} = lceil k a_t rceil - a_{t-1} < -M. ] Now, look at the pairs ((a_t, a_{t+1})) where (a_t < 0); by above, there are finitely many possible values of these pairs, and since there are infinitely many of them, we must have ((a_i, a_{i+1}) = (a_j, a_{j+1})) for different numbers ((i, j)), which implies that the sequence is periodic, which is a contradiction.

The equation of the ellipse is frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, where a > b > 0. The eccentricity of the ellipse is given by varepsilon = frac{sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}{a}. The focus of the ellipse has coordinates (c, 0), where c = ae = avarepsilon. The right directrix is the line x = frac{a}{varepsilon}. Point A, being the intersection of the right directrix with the x-axis, has coordinates (frac{a}{varepsilon}, 0). Point P lies on the ellipse, let's denote its coordinates by (x, y). Since the perpendicular bisector of AP passes through F, it implies that F is the midpoint of AP. Therefore, F has the coordinates left(frac{x + frac{a}{varepsilon}}{2}, frac{y}{2}right). However, we know the coordinates of F are (ae, 0). Setting the coordinates equal, we get the system of equations: frac{x + frac{a}{varepsilon}}{2} = ae, frac{y}{2} = 0. From the second equation, we conclude that y = 0, which implies that point P lies on the x-axis. Plugging y = 0 into our ellipse equation, we get: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{0^2}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1 implies x = pm a. Since we are considering the right side of the ellipse, we take x = a. Substitute x = a into the first equation of our system, and we get: frac{a + frac{a}{varepsilon}}{2} = ae implies a + frac{a}{varepsilon} = 2ae implies 1 + frac{1}{varepsilon} = 2varepsilon. Solving for varepsilon, we have: 2varepsilon^2 - varepsilon - 1 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots of the equation are varepsilon = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 4 cdot 2}}{4} = frac{1 pm sqrt{9}}{4} = frac{1 pm 3}{4}. Since varepsilon > 0, we discard the negative root and have varepsilon = 1 or varepsilon = frac{1}{2}. However, as a > b, the eccentricity varepsilon should be greater than zero and less than 1. This means that varepsilon = 1 is not valid since it would imply a circle.

We know: [ 2 mod 7 = 2 ] - Since the game always involves alternating moves, subtracting ‘2’ consistently starting from a number divisible by 7 each time leaves the number modulo 7 as 0 when it is Pierrot's turn and incrementing correctly on Arlekin's turn. 5. **Determination of Last Move**: - Pierrot must have faced a requirement to take either 9 or 23 matches such that it left a remainder (mod 7) that added correctly to the former state and left the cyclic sum consistent. - The last move reduced the match count to two, implying preceding sequences reduced state to modulo 7 cycle zero states via incremental minus 5 modules. 6. **Final Identifications**: - Conclusively, the player to cause the state to reach the final modulo witness as two in sequence was Arlekin. - He executed his initial moves as per 7-cycle enormity to fix the non-alignment. # Conclusion: Arlekin walked first and eventually emerged victorious: [ boxed{text{Arlekin first and won}} ]"},{"prompt":"Greg's local softball team consists of 12 players, and they need to buy one uniform each, made up of a shirt, a pair of pants, and socks.

We start by analyzing the given recurrence relation for the sequence ((a_n)_{n geq 1}): [ a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+2} quad text{for} quad n geq 2. ] This implies that each term in the sequence is the sum of the previous term and the term two places ahead. 2. To find the maximum number of consecutive positive terms, we first consider a specific example. Let's take the sequence starting with (a_1 = 1), (a_2 = 2), (a_3 = 3), (a_4 = 1), and (a_5 = 1). We check if these terms satisfy the recurrence relation: [ a_2 = a_1 + a_4 implies 2 = 1 + 1, ] [ a_3 = a_2 + a_5 implies 3 = 2 + 1. ] Both equations are satisfied, and we have five consecutive positive terms: (1, 2, 3, 1, 1). 3. Next, we need to prove that it is impossible to have six consecutive positive terms. Assume there exists a sequence with six consecutive positive terms (a_n, a_{n+1}, ldots, a_{n+5}). We write down the recurrence relations for these terms: [ a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n+3}, ] [ a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_{n+4}, ] [ a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+5}. ] 4. Adding these three equations together, we get: [ a_{n+1} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} = a_n + a_{n+3} + a_{n+1} + a_{n+4} + a_{n+2} + a_{n+5}. ] Simplifying, we cancel out the common terms on both sides: [ a_{n+2} + a_{n+3} = a_n + a_{n+4} + a_{n+5}. ] 5. Since (a_n, a_{n+4},) and (a_{n+5}) are all positive, the right-hand side of the equation is positive. However, the left-hand side (a_{n+2} + a_{n+3}) is also positive. This leads to a contradiction because the sum of positive terms cannot equal zero. Therefore, it is impossible to have six consecutive positive terms. 6. Hence, the maximum number of consecutive positive terms in the sequence is 5.

Let's derive the equation of this common chord: The equation of the second circle can be rewritten as (x^2-4x+4) + (y^2+2y+1) - 3 - 4 - 1=0, which is equivalent to (x-2)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 3^2. This suggests the circle is centered at (2, -1) with a radius of 3. The common chord must lie on the line that is radical axis of the two circles. Since the first circle's equation is x^2+y^2=9 and is centered at (0,0) with a radius of 3, we can find the equation of the radical axis by subtracting the equation of the first circle from the second: [ x^2+y^2-4x+2y-3 - (x^2+y^2) = -4x+2y-3 = 0. ] This is the equation of the common chord.

Step 1: Identify the axis of symmetry of the parabola. The given parabola is y=-2(x+1)^2-1. The axis of symmetry for a parabola in the form y=a(x-h)^2+k is the line x=h. Therefore, for our parabola, the axis of symmetry is the line x=-1.

Step 3: Analyze the effect of distance from the axis of symmetry on y values. Since the parabola opens downwards (as indicated by the negative coefficient of the quadratic term, -2), the y value (height) of a point on the parabola decreases as the distance from the axis of symmetry increases. Therefore, the point closest to the axis of symmetry (B) will have the highest y value, and the point farthest from the axis (C) will have the lowest y value.

So, -frac{π}{2} leq 2x - frac{π}{3} leq frac{π}{2}, Adding frac{π}{3} to all sides, we get: -frac{π}{2} + frac{π}{3} leq 2x leq frac{π}{2} + frac{π}{3}, This simplifies to: -frac{π}{6} leq 2x leq frac{5π}{6}, Now, dividing by 2, we get: -frac{π}{12} leq x leq frac{5π}{12}. Since the function has a period of π, all monotonically increasing intervals can be represented as [kπ - frac{π}{12}, kπ + frac{5π}{12}], where k in Z. Hence, the monotonically increasing interval of the function f(x) is boxed{[kπ - frac{π}{12}, kπ + frac{5π}{12}] (k in Z)}."},{"prompt":"Find the sum of the cubes of two numbers if their sum is 1 and their product is 1.

According to the problem, Bucket B has half the capacity of Bucket A, so ( C_B = frac{1}{2} C_A ). Initially, Bucket A is 1/4 full, so the amount of sand in Bucket A initially is ( frac{1}{4} C_A ). After pouring the contents of Bucket B into Bucket A, Bucket A is filled to 0.4375 of its capacity. This means the amount of sand in Bucket A after pouring is ( 0.4375 C_A ). The difference between the amount of sand in Bucket A after pouring and before pouring is the amount of sand that was in Bucket B. So, the amount of sand that was in Bucket B initially is: ( 0.4375 C_A - frac{1}{4} C_A = frac{7}{16} C_A - frac{1}{4} C_A ) To find the common denominator, we can convert ( frac{1}{4} ) to ( frac{4}{16} ): ( frac{7}{16} C_A - frac{4}{16} C_A = frac{3}{16} C_A ) This ( frac{3}{16} C_A ) is the amount of sand that was in Bucket B initially. Now, we need to express this amount as a fraction of Bucket B's capacity ( C_B ). Since ( C_B = frac{1}{2} C_A ), we can substitute ( C_B ) into the equation: ( frac{3}{16} C_A = frac{3}{16} times 2C_B = frac{3}{8} C_B ) Therefore, the initial fraction of Bucket B's capacity that was filled with sand is ( boxed{frac{3}{8}} )."},{"prompt":"A train of a certain length is traveling at 45 km/hr and can cross a bridge in 30 seconds.

The sizes remain (p)-integers if we repeatedly equalize groups of sizes not divisible by (p). To make all balloons equal, each must have size (M/n), which is not a (p)-integer since (M) is not divisible by (p). This contradiction shows (k) must be at least as large as any prime dividing (n).

Next, set ( y = z = 0 ) in the functional equation: [ f(x,0) + f(0,0) + f(0,x) = 0 implies f(x,0) + 0 + f(0,x) = 0 implies f(x,0) = -f(0,x). ] 4. Define ( g(x) = f(x,0) ).

First, we note that since A and B lie on the graph of the hyperbolic function, they must be on the same branch of the hyperbola. This is because the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to its asymptotes, and points on different branches would not satisfy the condition m > n given the domain of A and B. Given x values for A and B are -3 and -2 respectively, and since -3 < -2, we are moving to the right along the x-axis from A to B. Given m > n, the y-value decreases as x increases, which is a characteristic of the decreasing branch of a hyperbola in the given context. For the hyperbolic function y=frac{k-1}{x} to exhibit this behavior, the numerator k-1 must be positive. This is because a positive numerator with a negative x (as in our points A and B) results in a negative y value, and the magnitude of y decreases as x increases (moves towards zero from the negative side), which matches the condition m > n.

Then, shift ( l_3 ) by an arbitrarily small margin such that ( l_1, l_2, l_3 ) no longer concur, and the intersections and regions ( l_3 ) creates with all chords other than ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) are not affected. In this manner, the number of regions by having these chords not concur increases (by 1), since through this shifting, a new region determined by ( l_1 ), ( l_2 ), and ( l_3 ) is created. Applying this logic to every set of 3 or more chords yields the desired result. 3. Now, treat the optimal configuration as a graph. We first compute the number of vertices. Observe that there is a bijection between chord intersection points inside the circle and sets of 4 points on the circumference, because each such intersection point is the intersection of the diagonals of a quadrilateral with its vertices on the circumference, and vice versa. As a result, there are ( binom{n}{4} ) intersection points, and combining this with the ( n ) points on the circumference gives ( binom{n}{4} + n ) vertices in the graph. 4. We then compute the number of edges. There are ( binom{n}{2} ) chords connecting the ( n ) points on the circumference, and each of the ( binom{n}{4} ) interior intersection points creates 2 additional edges, because it splits each of the 2 edges it lies on into 2 smaller edges. As a result, there are ( 2 binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{2} ) edges inside the circle, and combining this with the ( n ) arcs forming the circumference yields ( 2 binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{2} + n ) edges in the graph. 5. Hence, by Euler's characteristic, [ F = E - V + 2 = left(2 binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{2} + nright) - left(binom{n}{4} + nright) + 2 = binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{2} + 2, ] and subtracting the 1 region outside of the circle gives [ boxed{binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{2} + 1} ] regions inside the circle, as requested."},{"prompt":"w many naturalnumber factors does N have if N = 2^4 cdot 3^3 cdot 5^2 cdot 7^2?","completion":"To determine the number of natural-number factors of N = 2^4 cdot 3^3 cdot 5^2 cdot 7^2, we consider the general form of any positive integer divisor of N, which can be expressed as 2^a cdot 3^b cdot 5^c cdot 7^d.

However, this leads to a contradiction since if A is truthful, then there cannot be just one knight (both V and S contradicting each other implies at least two would need to be knights or one knight and one liar). 3.

Therefore, we can write: [ P(|D - K| < |K - M|) = P(|D - K| > |K - M|) ] 3. **Calculate the probability of equality:** We need to consider the cases where ( |D - K| = |K - M| ). This happens in two scenarios: - ( D = M ) - ( K ) is the midpoint of ( D ) and ( M ), and ( D ) and ( M ) have the same parity. 4. **Case 1: ( D = M ):** If ( D = M ), then ( K ) can be any of the 100 integers.

There are 50 even and 50 odd numbers in the set ({1, 2, ldots, 100}). For each pair of even numbers, there is one midpoint ( K ), and similarly for odd numbers.

Suppose for some natural number (k geq 1), we define (P_{k}(x) = underbrace{P(P(ldots P}_{k}(x) ldots))). According to the conditions, the polynomial (P_{m}(x)) has real roots, and all of these roots are positive. 2. **Assume the Contradiction:** Assume that the polynomial (P(x)) does not have positive roots. This implies that (P(x) > 0) for sufficiently large (x) and does not change its sign as (x > 0). Hence, the polynomial (P) maps positive numbers to positive numbers. 3. **Polynomial Mapping:** Given the property that (P) maps positive numbers to positive numbers, it follows that all polynomials (P_{k}(x)) will also map positive numbers to positive numbers. 4. **Contradiction:** This leads to a contradiction because it's given that (P_{m}(x)) has positive roots. Therefore, our initial assumption that (P(x)) has no positive roots must be false. 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, the polynomial (P(x)) must have positive roots. 6. **Case Analysis for (P(0)=0):** If (P(0) = 0), then (P_{m}(0) = 0). This means that 0 is not a root of the polynomial (P(x)). 7. **Roots with Different Signs:** Now assume that (P(x)) has both negative and positive roots. We will prove by induction that for all natural numbers (k), the polynomial (P_{k}(x)) has both negative and positive roots. 8. **Base Case:** For (k=1), the polynomial (P(x)) has both negative and positive roots. 9. **Induction Step:** Assume that the polynomial (P_{k}(x)) has both negative and positive roots. Let (x_1) and (x_2) be the smallest and largest roots of (P(x)), and (x_3) and (x_4) be the smallest and largest roots of (P_{k}(x)). We have: - (x_1 < 0), - (x_2 > 0), - (x_3 < 0), - (x_4 > 0). 10. **Behavior for Odd and Even (n):** - If (n) is odd: (P(x)) takes all values from (-infty) to 0 in the interval ((-infty, x_1]). - There exists a number (x_5) such that (P(x_5) = x_3). - If (n) is even: (P(x)) takes all values from 0 to (+infty) in the interval ((-infty, x_1]). - There exists a number (x_6) such that (P(x_6) = x_4). 11. **Values of (P(x)) for Positive (x):** - In both cases, (P(x)) takes all values from 0 to (+infty) in the interval ([x_2, +infty)). - There exists a number (x_7) such that (P(x_7) = x_4). 12. **Result after Induction:** Therefore, for both choices of (n), (P_{k+1}(x_5) = P_{k}(P(x_5))) and (P_{k+1}(x_6) = P_{k}(P(x_6))). - Here, (x_5 < 0) and (x_6 > 0). 13. **Final Contradiction and Conclusion:** The polynomial (P(x)) having both negative and positive roots leads to the conclusion that this only leaves one possibility – the polynomial (P(x)) has real roots that are all positive.

A tasty set (S) is defined such that the number of embeddings of (G) in the plane with (P_i = Q_i) for each (i in S) is finite and nonzero. 2. **Key Insight:** For a tree (G), the smallest size of a tasty set (f(G)) is the number of leaves in (G). This is because fixing the positions of the leaves uniquely determines the positions of the other vertices in the tree. 3. **Counting Trees with Leaves:** By Cayley's formula, the number of labeled trees on (n) vertices is (n^{n-2}). We need to count the number of trees with a specific number of leaves. 4. **Generating Function Approach:** The coefficient of (x_1^{d_1} cdots x_n^{d_n}) in ((x_1 + cdots + x_n)^{n-2}) gives the number of labeled trees where vertex (i) has degree (d_i + 1). For (r) fixed vertices to be leaves, the number of such trees is ((n-r)^{n-2}). 5. **Sieve Method (PIE):** Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE), we derive the generating function for the number of trees with (k) leaves: [ g(x) = sum_{k=0}^infty t_k x^k = sum_{r=0}^n binom{n}{r} (n-r)^{n-2} (x-1)^r ] 6. **Expected Value Calculation:** Since there are (n^{n-2}) labeled trees, the expected value (a_n) is given by: [ a_n = frac{1}{n^2} frac{left((xfrac{d}{dx})^2 g(x)right)}{n^{n-2}} biggvert_{x=1} ] Simplifying, we get: [ a_n = frac{n(n-1)^{n-2} + n(n-1)(n-2)^{n-2}}{n^n} ] 7. **Limit Calculation:** Taking the limit as (n to infty): [ lim_{n to infty} a_n = lim_{n to infty} left(1 - frac{2}{n}right)^{n-2} = e^{-2} ] 8. **Final Answer:** We need to compute (leftlfloor 2019 lim_{n to infty} a_n rightrfloor): [ leftlfloor 2019 e^{-2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2019 times frac{1}{e^2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2019 times 0.1353 rightrfloor = 273 ] The final answer is (boxed{273})"},{"prompt":"The function f(x)= begin{cases} 2^{x}, & x < 2 log_{2}x, & xgeqslant 2 end{cases}, then f(f(2))= ____.

Consider the lines parallel to ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ), each placed at a distance ( a ) from ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) respectively. The points of intersection of these parallel lines will form a rectangle ( M_1 M_2 M_3 M_4 ). 3. **Understanding the Locus:** We need to show that the required geometric locus is the extension of the sides of this rectangle. To do this, consider a point ( X ) and drop perpendiculars ( X A_1 ) and ( X A_2 ) to the lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) respectively. 4. **Construction for a Specific Point:** Assume ( |XA_1 - XA_2| = a ). Without loss of generality, suppose ( XA_1 - XA_2 = a ). 5. **Auxiliary Points and Parallel Lines:** On the ray ( A_1X ), take a point ( B ) such that ( A_1B = a ). By construction, since ( XA_1 - XA_2 = a ) and ( XA_1 = XB + XA_2 ), it follows that ( BX = XA_2 ). 6. **Intersection and Alignment:** Let ( M ) be the intersection point of the line ( l_2 ) and the line parallel to ( l_1 ) passing through ( B ) (i.e., ( B ) lies on a line parallel to ( l_1 ) and intersects ( l_2 ) at ( M )). Thus, ( M ) is one of the vertices ( M_1, M_2, M_3, ) or ( M_4 ) of the rectangle. 7. **Angle Bisector Property:** Consequently, segment ( MX ) serves as the angle bisector of ( angle BMA_2 ). This implies that if we extend the sides of the rectangle ( M_1 M_2 M_3 M_4 ), the bisector ( MX ) ensures that every point ( X ) maintaining the difference in distances condition lies along these extensions. # Conclusion: The geometric locus of points ( X ) such that the difference in their distances from the lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) is equal to a given length ( a ) is the extension of the sides of the rectangle formed by lines parallel to ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) at a distance ( a ) from them.

We are given the numbers from 1 to 11 and need to arrange them in circles such that the sum of the numbers on each of the ten segments is the same. 2. First, let's find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 11. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers: [ sum_{i=1}^{11} i = frac{n(n+1)}{2} = frac{11 cdot 12}{2} = 66 ] 3. Let's denote the sum we are looking for as ( S ). Since there are 10 segments and each segment's sum should be the same ( S ), we must have: [ text{Sum of all numbers} = text{Sum of each triplet} times 10 ] This gives us: [ 66 = S times 10 implies S = frac{66}{10} = 6.6 ] However, ( S ) should be a whole number because it is the sum of integers. So, there must be special placements of the numbers such that their sums yield integer segments. 4. Next, we will arrange the numbers from 1 to 11 in specific positions such that each of the ten segment sums to the same value.

This means that there exists at least one point P in E that does not lie on a line Delta which passes through at least two other points of E. 2. **Distance Minimization:** - Since E is a finite set, the number of such pairs (P, Delta) is finite. According to the **Principle of Extremum**, there exists a pair (P, Delta) such that the distance from P to the line Delta is minimized. Let this minimal pair be (P, Delta). - Note that the distance from P to Delta is strictly positive because P does not lie on Delta by the hypothesis. 3. **Points on Delta:** - Given the definition of E, for every pair of points (A, B) in E, there exists a third point C also in E such that C lies on the line defined by A and B. Thus, Delta must contain at least three distinct points of E. Without loss of generality, let these points be A, B, and C which lie on Delta. 4. **Contradiction with Minimal Distance:** - Consider the perpendicular projection of P onto the line Delta. Let this perpendicular projection point be H. - Next, identify a point D in Delta such that D is closer to H than P. This forms a right triangle PHD where PD is the hypotenuse and PH is one of the legs. 5. **Hypotenuse Property:** - By the **Pythagorean Theorem**, in a right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is always greater than the length of the legs. Therefore, PD > PH. 6. **Error in Initial Assumption:** - However, (H, Delta) should have been a pair if it minimized the distance, which contradicts our selection of (P, Delta) as having the minimum distance. This implies that our initial assumption that P is not on Delta is incorrect. 7. **Conclusion:** - Every point in E must lie on some line Delta. Since Delta can be arbitrarily chosen among lines passing through any two points of E, all points of E are collinear. This establishes that all points in E are aligned on the same straight line. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that the major axis of an ellipse is 8 and its eccentricity is frac{3}{4}, the standard equation of this ellipse is __________.","completion":"From the given information, we know that 2a=8, thus a=4.

Therefore, the ratio of side lengths is sqrt{4} = 2. Expressing 2 in the form frac{asqrt{b}}{c}, we can choose a=2, b=1 (since sqrt{1} = 1 and does not change the expression) and c=1.

We are given the angles at the vertices A, B, C, D, E, with A = 95^{circ} and B = 105^{circ}. We are to prove: cos A = cos C + cos D - cos (C + D) - frac{1}{2} 2. **Diagonal Computations in Pentagons:** The diagonals BD and DE play a crucial role. First, note that for any isosceles triangle with a base which is a diagonal, we can compute: BD = 2 sin left( frac{C}{2} right) Now, squaring this value, we get: BD^2 = 4 sin^2 left( frac{C}{2} right) Using the identity sin^2 x = frac{1 - cos 2x}{2}: BD^2 = 4 left(frac{1 - cos C}{2}right) = 2 - 2 cos C 3. **Using the Cosine Rule in Triangle BDE:** Applying the Cosine Rule in the triangle BDE, noting that BD, DE, and angle BDE appear in our computations, we write: BE^2 = BD^2 + DE^2 - 2 cdot BD cdot DE cdot cos angle BDE Since our angles E and D can switch positions based on different configurations, solving this we can consider the angles separately: angle BDE = D - left( 90^{circ} - frac{C}{2} right) = D + frac{C}{2} - 90^{circ} 4. **Simplification Using Trigonometric Identities:** From the expression obtained, using: 2 sin x sin y = cos (x - y) - cos (x + y) We rewrite: BE^2 = 3 - 2 cos C - 2 cos D + 2 cos (C + D) 5. **Comparison with Triangle BAE:** Using Cosine Rule in triangle BAE, we will apply: BE^2 = 2 - 2 cos A 6. **Establishing the Given Relationship:** Equating and simplifying we arrive: 3 - 2 cos C - 2 cos D + 2 cos (C + D) = 2 - 2 cos A Rearranging further: 2 - 2 cos C - 2 cos D + 2 cos (C + D) = 1 + 2 cos A Dividing through by 2: cos A = cos C + cos D - cos (C + D) - frac{1}{2} This completes the proof of the given identity.

This can be rewritten as f(x) = 2^x. The function F(x) = f(x) - frac{1}{f(x)} = 2^x - 2^{-x}. Its domain is mathbb{R}, and F(-x) = 2^{-x} - 2^x = -F(x).

What is the maximal possible number of edges in such a graph?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a simple graph with 300 vertices where no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent. We need to find the maximal possible number of edges in such a graph. 2. **Claim:** The maximal possible number of edges is given by: [ frac{1}{2} (299 + 298 cdot 2 + cdots + 276 cdot 24) = 42550 ] 3. **Proof of Bound:** - We need to show that we can have at most ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ). - Consider the degrees of the vertices. Since no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent, the vertices with the same degree must form an independent set. - The maximum degree a vertex can have is 299 (since there are 300 vertices in total). - If we have ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ), then these vertices form an independent set, and thus, they do not contribute to each other's degree. 4. **Summing the Degrees:** - We need to sum the degrees of all vertices to find the total number of edges. - The sum of the degrees of the vertices is given by: [ sum_{k=1}^{24} k cdot (300 - k) ] - This is because we can have ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ) for ( k ) from 1 to 24. 5. **Calculating the Sum:** - We need to calculate the sum: [ sum_{k=1}^{24} k cdot (300 - k) ] - This can be expanded as: [ sum_{k=1}^{24} (300k - k^2) ] - Separating the sums, we get: [ 300 sum_{k=1}^{24} k - sum_{k=1}^{24} k^2 ] 6. **Using Known Summation Formulas:** - The sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] - The sum of the squares of the first ( n ) natural numbers is: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} ] - For ( n = 24 ): [ sum_{k=1}^{24} k = frac{24 cdot 25}{2} = 300 ] [ sum_{k=1}^{24} k^2 = frac{24 cdot 25 cdot 49}{6} = 4900 ] 7. **Substituting Back:** - Substituting these values back into our sum, we get: [ 300 cdot 300 - 4900 = 90000 - 4900 = 85100 ] - Since each edge is counted twice in the sum of the degrees, the total number of edges is: [ frac{85100}{2} = 42550 ] 8. **Construction:** - Label ( k ) vertices with the label ( k ) for ( k ) between 1 and 24. - Connect all pairs of vertices except those with the same label. - This construction ensures that no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent, and it achieves the bound.

This is verified by the fact that a trihedral angle is formed at the vertex where three planes intersect, and their intersection (projected onto a plane) forms a triangle with interior angles summing up to 180 degrees: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ ] 5. **Dihedral Angles in Tetrahedron:** The dihedral angles are the angles between the two planes.

Solution We are given the segments ( PQ ) and ( RS ), which are parallel. We need to construct a right triangle such that the bisector of the right angle divides the hypotenuse into segments of length ( PQ ) and ( RS ).

II. Solution We use the property of the angle bisector, which passes through the midpoint (F) of the arc made by the opposite side of the starting angle in the triangle's circumscribed circle. For right triangles, this is the midpoint of the hypotenuse. 1. Repeat steps 1 and 2 from the first solution to find segment (PT). 2. Draw a line through (T) at a (45^{circ}) angle to (PT) to find the midpoint (F) of the hypotenuse. 3. Construct the segment (FQ).

The correct approach is to consider the cumulative sum of odd numbers in each group, which forms a sequence of the sums of the first n odd numbers: [1, 1+3, 1+3+5+7, ldots] This sequence can be represented as: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ldots] Which is the sequence of square numbers.

The mistake was in directly applying the square root to find the group number. Instead, we should calculate the group that reaches or exceeds the position of 2009 in the sequence of all odd numbers. The correct approach involves finding the group number n such that the cumulative count of odd numbers up to and including that group is just enough to include the 2009th odd number.

This initial arrangement serves as the base to build the required arrangement through transformative steps. 2. **Transformative Operations**: - There are two primary operations we will use to modify the initial grid of zeroes to achieve the desired unique integers while maintaining sums of zero in each row. These operations are: a. **Layer Swapping**: Interchange two layers of unit cubes that are parallel to one of the cube's faces. b. **Sign-Based Addition and Subtraction**: Add a specific number to all integers in specific positions marked by 'plus' (+), and subtract the same number from all integers in positions marked by 'minus' (-). Consider a simple case for illustration: - For a cube with ( n = 3 ), there are 27 unit cubes.

Every cube at position ((x, y, z)) is assigned the value: [ a(x, y, z) = x cdot n^2 + y cdot n + z - left( frac{n(n-1)}{2} right) ] This assignment ensures the values are sequentially unique within the range and guarantees that per any line parallel to the edges, the sums of the values cancel out to zero. 5. **Sum Verification**: - The sum of values in any row: - For instance, in a row along the x-axis, the sum of the values integrates contributions from shifting along other dimensions, ensuring the combined shift results in zero. A similar concept applies uniformly to other axes. 6. **Concluding Design**: - By this construction, each number from the set will be unique due to linear index calculation, and the shift ensures the sum of each line follows the zero-sum property.

Step 5: Use properties of the equilateral triangle In an equilateral triangle, the altitude has the property that it equals any side of the triangle times (frac{sqrt{3}}{2}).

If the equation f(x)=0 has three distinct real roots, find the range of possible values for c.","completion":"1. Since f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c, we have its derivative as f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b. Because f(x) attains extreme values at x=1 and x=3, the derivative must be zero at these points: begin{align*} f'(1) &= 3 + 2a + b = 0, f'(3) &= 27 + 6a + b = 0. end{align*} Solving this system of equations: begin{align*} 2a + b &= -3, 6a + b &= -27. end{align*} Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us 4a = -24, so a = -6. Plugging a = -6 into the first equation yields b = 9. So we have boxed{a = -6} and boxed{b = 9}. 2. With a = -6 and b = 9, the function becomes f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + c. Its derivative is f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 3(x - 1)(x - 3). From the derivative, we can observe the following behavior: - For x in (-infty, 1), f'(x) > 0, which means f(x) is increasing. - For x in (1, 3), f'(x) < 0, which indicates f(x) is decreasing. - For x in (3, +infty), f'(x) > 0, suggesting f(x) is increasing again. Therefore, f(x) reaches its maximum value at x=1, which is f(1) = 1^3 - 6 cdot 1^2 + 9 cdot 1 + c = 4 + c, and its minimum value at x=3, which is f(3) = 3^3 - 6 cdot 3^2 + 9 cdot 3 + c = 27 - 54 + 27 + c = c. For f(x)=0 to have three distinct real roots, the graph of y=f(x) must intersect the x-axis at three different points, implying that the maximum value 4 + c must be greater than zero and the minimum value c must be less than zero.

Substituting into the formula: [ text{Number of permutations} = frac{10!}{2! cdot 4! cdot 3! cdot 1!} ] 3. **Step 3: Calculation** First, calculate the factorial values: [ 10! = 3628800 ] [ 2! = 2 ] [ 4! = 24 ] [ 3! = 6 ] [ 1! = 1 ] Substitute these values back into the formula: [ text{Number of permutations} = frac{3628800}{2 cdot 24 cdot 6 cdot 1} = frac{3628800}{288} = 12600 ] # Conclusion: There are ( boxed{12600} ) different possible outcomes for the given shooting configuration."},{"prompt":"Let n, in mathbb {N^*} , nge 3 a) Prove that the polynomial f (x)=frac {X^{2^n1}1}{X1}X^n has a divisor of form X^p +1 where pinmathbb {N^*} b) Show that for n=7 the polynomial f (X) has three divisors with integer coefficients .","completion":"# Part (a) We need to prove that the polynomial ( f(x) = frac{x^{2^n-1} - 1}{x-1} - x^n ) has a divisor of the form ( x^p + 1 ) where ( p in mathbb{N^*} ). 1. **Case 1: ( n = 2k )** If ( n = 2k ), then ( 2^n - 1 = m ) where ( m > n ). The polynomial ( f(x) ) can be written as: [ f(x) = frac{x^{m} - 1}{x - 1} - x^n = x^{m-1} + x^{m-2} + cdots + x + 1 - x^{2k} ] By the Remainder Theorem, if ( f(-1) = 0 ), then ( f(x) ) is divisible by ( x + 1 ).

Using the property of arithmetic sequences, p + q = m + n Rightarrow a_p + a_q = a_m + a_n, we can find the value of n when S_n is minimized. **Step-by-Step Solution**: 1. We know that S_{20} = frac{20(a_1 + a_{20})}{2} = 10(a_1 + a_{20}). 2. Applying the property of arithmetic sequences, a_1 + a_{20} = a_{11} + a_{10}. 3.

When the focus of the parabola is at point A, we consider the parabola as opening to the left, with the equation of the form y^2 = -2px (where p > 0, since the parabola opens to the left and its vertex is at the origin). The focus of a parabola y^2 = -2px is at the point (-frac{p}{2}, 0). For A(-2,0) to be the focus, we set -frac{p}{2} = -2, which implies that p = 4. Thus, the equation of the parabola with focus A is y^2 = -8x. 2. If the parabola has its focus at point B, it opens upwards, and the equation can be written as x^2 = 2p'y (where p' > 0, since parabolas that open upwards have a positive coefficient for y). The focus of a parabola x^2 = 2p'y is at the point (0, frac{p'}{2}). Setting frac{p'}{2} = 2, we find that p' = 4. Therefore, the equation of the parabola with focus B is x^2 = 8y. Considering both cases, the parabola's equation could be either y^2 = -8x or x^2 = 8y. So the final answer is that the equation of the parabola is either boxed{y^2 = -8x} or boxed{x^2 = 8y}.

Recognize that the points M and N on the circle x^{2}+y^{2}-2x+my-4=0 being symmetric with respect to the line 2x+y=0 implies that this line passes through the center of the circle. 2. The equation of the circle is x^{2}+y^{2}-2x+my-4=0. Completing the squares for x and y, we can rewrite the equation in the form (x-1)^{2}+(y+dfrac{m}{2})^{2}=r^2, where r is the radius. From this, we can deduce the center of the circle is at left(1,-dfrac{m}{2}right). 3.

This is because the base and height of the triangle relative to those lines remain constant, preserving the area. 4. **Triangle Area Calculation at Target Positions**: The final positions we want to check are ((0,0)), ((0,1)), and ((1,0)).

This means that after adding the water, the amount of milk remains M liters, but the amount of water becomes W + 62 liters.

We also need to determine if a rational (x) satisfies this equation. 1. **Understand the problem:** - The fractional part ({ x }) of a real number (x) is defined as (x - lfloor x rfloor), where (lfloor x rfloor) is the greatest integer less than or equal to (x). 2. **Assume (x > 1):** - Without loss of generality, we can take (x > 1). This simplifies our expressions for the fractional parts. 3. **Expression for fractional parts:** - Since (x > 1), (left{ frac{1}{x} right} = frac{1}{x}), since (frac{1}{x} < 1). - Let (x = n + f) where (n = lfloor x rfloor) and (f = { x }). This implies (f = x - n), where (0 leq f < 1). 4. **Set up the equation:** [ left{ x right} + left{ frac{1}{x} right} = 1 ] Substituting the expressions for the fractional parts, we get: [ f + frac{1}{x} = 1 ] Since (f = x - n), the equation becomes: [ (x - n) + frac{1}{x} = 1 ] 5. **Simplify and solve for (x):** [ x - n + frac{1}{x} = 1 ] Multiply through by (x) to clear the denominator: [ x^2 - nx + 1 = x ] Rearrange into a standard quadratic equation: [ x^2 - (n+1)x + 1 = 0 ] 6. **Solve the quadratic equation:** Use the quadratic formula (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) with (a = 1), (b = -(n+1)), and (c = 1): [ x = frac{(n+1) pm sqrt{(n+1)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1}}{2 cdot 1} ] Simplify the expression under the square root: [ x = frac{(n+1) pm sqrt{n^2 + 2n - 3}}{2} ] 7. **Check integer and rational cases:** - For (x) to be rational, (sqrt{n^2 + 2n - 3}) must be rational. - Given (n) integers from 0, 1, 2, ...etc., let's evaluate some specific cases. - If (n = 0): [ x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 - 3}}{2} ] [ x = frac{1 pm sqrt{-2}}{2} quad text{(not real)} ] - If (n = 1): [ x = frac{2 pm sqrt{1 + 2 - 3}}{2} ] [ x = frac{2 pm sqrt{0}}{2} ] [ x = 1 quad text{(does not satisfy (x > 1))} ] - If (n = 2): [ x = frac{3 pm sqrt{4 + 2 - 3}}{2} ] [ x = frac{3 pm sqrt{3}}{2} ] This works, leading to: [ x = frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2} quad text{(real and irrational)} ] - For other (n) values, the quadratic root under the square root is non-integral and thus proves to be irrational. 8. **Conclusion:** - After checking some cases, we find specific real values such as (x = frac{3 + sqrt{5}}{2}) and other irrational solutions. - We conclude no rational (x) satisfies the original equation since (sqrt{n^2 + 2n - 3}) cannot be an integer, and thus (x) remains irrational.

The condition translates to b - (a + c) = 1. To find the smallest such number, we aim to minimize a, b, and c while satisfying the condition. The smallest value for a is 1 (since a=0 would not make it a three-digit number), and to make b - (a + c) = 1 as small as possible, we set c = 0 (the smallest value for the units digit) and b = 2 (the smallest value for the tens digit that satisfies the condition with a=1 and c=0).

Since 9 is already a square, |a-c| must also be a square. To maximize N, we maximize b, hence b=9. Also, a+c=8 and a>c to ensure N is as large as possible. Given 0 < a, c < 9 and a-c must be a square, the largest square less than 9 is 4 (since 3^2=9 is not less than 9). Therefore, a-c=4. Solving a+c=8 and a-c=4 simultaneously gives a=6 and c=2.

Part (a) The problem states whether there always exists a chord that divides any arbitrary polygon (including non-convex ones) into two equal-area parts. Let’s consider: 1. **Example Construction**: - Consider a polygon constructed from three identical squares (halls) connected by thin, curved corridors. - Let ( S ) be the area of the polygon. - The squares have the area ( 0.3S ) each, and the corridors have a total area of ( 0.1S ). 2. **Analyzing Chord Intersection**: - If a chord intersects only a corridor, then on one side of the chord, there will be two squares, whose combined area is more than half of the polygon's area. - If a chord intersects one of the squares, it won't intersect the intersection of three corridors, leading again to one part of the polygon containing two squares, making the area greater than half.

The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 5 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{5}{3} ] Simplifying, we get: [ binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 cdot 4}{2 cdot 1} = 10 ] 3. **Three faces of the tetrahedron**: Since this scenario occurs on each of the three faces containing the point P_{1}, the total number is multiplied by 3: [ 3 times binom{5}{3} = 3 times 10 = 30 ] 4. **Including points on the base**: The base of the tetrahedron, which contains 5 points (excluding P_{1}), can also form groups of 4 points. Any such group will include two edge midpoints from two different edges descending from P_{1} and their corresponding midpoints. For these points, we just add them directly: [ 3 ] 5. **Total number of coplanar groups**: Summing these, we get: [ 3 times binom{5}{3} + 3 = 30 + 3 = 33 ] 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, there are 33 groups of four points that lie on the same plane.

A: Two isosceles triangles B: Two congruent triangles C: Two acute triangles D: Two right triangle","completion":"To solve the problem, we analyze the properties of a parallelogram and how they relate to the properties of triangles. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel and equal in length. When we think about assembling a parallelogram from two triangles, these triangles must share a common side (which becomes one side of the parallelogram) and their other sides must be able to form the remaining part of the parallelogram while adhering to the parallelogram's properties. - **Option A: Two isosceles triangles** - While isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length, there's no guarantee that when put together, they will form a parallelogram unless they are also congruent and oriented correctly. However, the condition of being isosceles alone does not ensure this. - **Option B: Two congruent triangles** - Two congruent triangles are identical in shape and size, meaning all their corresponding sides and angles are equal. When these triangles are placed such that they share a common side, the other sides naturally form a parallelogram because the conditions of equal and parallel opposite sides are met. This is because the congruent triangles ensure that the opposite sides of the resulting shape are equal in length and parallel. - **Option C: Two acute triangles** - Acute triangles have all angles less than 90 degrees. While two acute triangles can sometimes form a parallelogram, it is not guaranteed unless they are congruent and oriented correctly. Simply being acute does not ensure the formation of a parallelogram. - **Option D: Two right triangles** - Two right triangles can form a parallelogram, particularly if they are congruent. However, the key factor is congruency, not merely being right triangles. Without the condition of congruency, two right triangles do not always form a parallelogram. Given the above analysis, the only option that guarantees the formation of a parallelogram, based on the necessity for two pairs of opposite sides to be parallel and equal in length, is when the two triangles are congruent. This is because congruent triangles will have sides that match in length and angles that match in measure, ensuring that when assembled, they form a parallelogram. boxed{text{B}}"},{"prompt":"Given the sets M={x|(x+3)(x1)leqslant 0} and N={x|log_{2}xleqslant 1}, determine Mcup N= ( ) A: [3,2] B: [3,2) C: [1,2] D: (0,2]","completion":"**Analysis** This problem primarily tests the application of sets, which is a common question type in high school exams and is considered a basic question. **Step-by-step Solution** 1.

Vitya's strategy involves symmetry with respect to this point (O). 3. **Symmetrical Moves**: On each of Vitya's turns, he marks a point symmetrical to the point marked by Kolya relative to (O). This ensures each mark maintains the properties required by the game's rules – the points must be vertices of a convex polygon. 4. **Convex Polygon Formation**: This symmetry ensures that the points marked by both players will always form a convex polygon. Thus, after each pair of moves (one by Kolya and one by Vitya), the marked points can be connected to form a convex polygon. 5. **Central Symmetry**: When six points are marked (three by Kolya and three reflected symmetrically by Vitya), they form a centrally symmetric hexagon around point (O). This hexagon is a convex shape and follows the game's rule. 6. **Finite Number of Moves Contraction**: In future steps, the points to be marked will lie within one of the six triangular sections formed by the sides and the extensions of the sides of this hexagon. Hence, the number of possible moves becomes limited to the vertices within these triangular sections. 7. **Critical Conclusion**: Since Kolya will run out of possible symmetry-respecting moves (due to the finite number of vertices), there will eventually be a turn where Kolya cannot make a valid move, leading to his loss. # Conclusion: By correctly employing the symmetrical strategy, Vitya ensures that Kolya eventually cannot continue marking points validly.

When adding two binary numbers, the number of 1's in the sum (a + b) is given by (s(a+b) = s(a) + s(b) - h), where (h) is the number of carries that occur during the addition. 3. **Condition for the Problem:** The condition (s(a+b) = s(a) + s(b) - 1) implies that exactly one carry occurs during the addition of (a) and (b). 4. **Counting Carries:** To count the number of pairs ((a, b)) that result in exactly one carry, we need to consider the binary digits of (a) and (b). Each bit position can be either 0 or 1, and we need to determine how many combinations of these bits result in exactly one carry. 5. **Binary Digits and Carries:** For each bit position, there are three possible combinations that do not produce a carry (00, 01, 10) and one combination that does produce a carry (11). Since we need exactly one carry, we need to choose one bit position to have the combination (11) and the remaining bit positions to have one of the three non-carry combinations. 6. **Counting Combinations:** - There are 6 bit positions (since (0 leq a, b < 64)). - We choose one of these 6 positions to have the combination (11), and the remaining 5 positions to have one of the three non-carry combinations. Therefore, the number of ways to choose one position for the carry is (binom{6}{1} = 6). For each of the remaining 5 positions, there are 3 choices (00, 01, 10).

Given that Alice sees the airplane at a 30^circ angle of elevation, and Bob sees it at a 60^circ angle of elevation, we can form two right triangles: - Triangle ABC with Alice at A, the airplane at C, and the point directly below the airplane on the ground at B. - Triangle BAC with Bob at B, the airplane at C, and the point directly below the airplane on the ground at A. Step 1: Analyze Triangle ABC (Alice's view) - AC is the hypotenuse. - BC (altitude of the airplane, p) is the opposite side to angle 30^circ. - Using the properties of a 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle, the side opposite the 30^circ angle is frac{1}{2} the hypotenuse.

The difference in the total daily wages of the illiterate employees due to the decrease is ( 25I - 10I = 15I ). Let's denote the total daily wages of the literate employees as ( L ). Since there are 10 literate employees and their wages did not change, ( L ) remains constant. The average salary of all employees (literate and illiterate) decreased by Rs. 10 per day.

Each approach provides a unique perspective on how to calculate the expected position of the second ace in a shuffled deck of n cards containing three aces. Solution 1: Inductive Approach 1. **Base Case**: When n = 3, the deck contains only three aces. The only sequence to turn up the second ace requires turning up two cards. This gives us an expected number of cards turned up as (3 + 1)/2 = 2, which matches our calculation. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume that for a deck of n cards, the expected number of cards to turn up the second ace is (n + 1)/2. 3. **Inductive Step**: Consider a deck of n + 1 cards. By the hypothesis, in a deck of n cards, the expected number of cards to turn up the second ace is (n + 1)/2. When adding an additional card to the deck: - If the new card is placed before the second ace, it does not affect the count until the second ace. - If the new card is placed after the second ace, it also does not affect the count until the second ace. - The new card has an equal probability of being placed before or after the second ace. - Therefore, the expected increase in the number of cards turned up is 1/2 (half the time it contributes an extra card, half the time it contributes none). 4. **Conclusion**: The expected number of cards to turn up the second ace in a deck of n + 1 cards is (n + 1)/2 + 1/2 = (n + 2)/2. This completes the inductive step, proving the statement for all n geq 3. Solution 2: Symmetry Argument 1. Consider the position k of the second ace in the deck. 2. If we reverse the order of the deck, the second ace will appear in position n + 1 - k. 3. The expected position of the second ace should be the same whether we count from the front or the back due to symmetry. 4. Therefore, the expected position E(k) of the second ace is given by: [ E(k) = frac{k + (n + 1 - k)}{2} = frac{n + 1}{2} ] Solution 3: Division into Piles 1. The three aces divide the deck into four segments: a, b, c, and d. 2. The total number of non-ace cards is n - 3, so a + b + c + d = n - 3. 3. By symmetry and the random distribution of cards, E(a) = E(b) = E(c) = E(d). 4. Therefore, each expected value is E(a) = E(b) = E(c) = E(d) = frac{n-3}{4}. 5. The number of cards turned up to see the second ace includes all cards in the first two segments and the two aces within them: [ E(text{total}) = E(a) + 1 + E(b) + 1 = frac{n-3}{4} + 1 + frac{n-3}{4} + 1 = frac{n+1}{2} ] Each solution method arrives at the same conclusion, confirming the consistency and robustness of the result. boxed{frac{n+1}{2}}"},{"prompt":"Let ( Q = log_{128} 2^3 + log_{128} 2^5 + log_{128} 2^7 + ldots + log_{128} 2^P ).

Factor out the common log_{128}(2) from each term: [ Q = left(3 + 5 + 7 + ldots + 95right) log_{128}(2) ] 4. Find the sum of the arithmetic series 3, 5, 7, ldots, 95. The first term a = 3 and the common difference d = 2. To determine the number of terms n, use the formula for the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence: [ a_n = a + (n-1)d ] Set a_n = 95 to find n: [ 95 = 3 + (n-1)2 ] [ 95 - 3 = 2(n - 1) ] [ 92 = 2(n - 1) ] [ 46 = n - 1 ] [ n = 47 ] 5. Use the sum formula for an arithmetic series, S_n = frac{n}{2} left( a + l right), where l is the last term: [ S_{47} = frac{47}{2} left( 3 + 95 right) ] [ S_{47} = frac{47}{2} times 98 ] [ S_{47} = 47 times 49 = 2303 ] 6. Substitute back into the expression for Q: [ Q = 2303 log_{128}(2) ] 7. Simplify log_{128}(2) using the change of base formula: [ log_{128}(2) = frac{log_{2}(2)}{log_{2}(128)} ] Since 128 = 2^7: [ log_{2}(128) = 7 ] Therefore: [ log_{128}(2) = frac{1}{7} ] 8. Plug log_{128}(2) = frac{1}{7} back into the expression for Q: [ Q = 2303 cdot frac{1}{7} ] [ Q = frac{2303}{7} = 329 ] 9.

This can be characterized using the inferior and superior limits (varliminf and varlimsup respectively). If the limit does not exist, it implies that the inferior limit is strictly less than the superior limit.

Prove that if 14 squares are uncovered, at least one more domino can be placed on the board without moving the others.","completion":"**I. Solution:** 1. **Assigning Dominoes for Each Uncovered Square:** Consider each uncovered square on the board, except for those in the topmost row. For each uncovered square, we assign the domino that covers its upper neighboring square (if such a domino exists). If there is no such domino—meaning the upper neighbor of an uncovered square is also uncovered—then clearly there will be an uncovered pair where we can place a new domino. 2. **Analysis of Claims:** If in the process of our assignments, the same domino gets assigned to two different uncovered squares, then these uncovered squares are adjacent, allowing a new domino to be placed over them. Therefore, we can assume that all assignments are unique; meaning each uncovered square (other than those in the topmost row) has a unique domino assigned to the square above it. 3. **Uncovered Squares and Unique Dominoes:** This means in the \\"lower\\" (6 times 5) section of the board, every uncovered square has a unique domino assigned from the same section of the board. Now, if there are more than 3 uncovered squares in the top row, some uncovered pairs must be neighbors, permitting another domino to fit. 4. **When the Top has Fewer than 4 Uncovered Squares:** Suppose that at least 11 uncovered squares are in the lower (6 times 5) section. The 11 dominos assigned to cover squares in the top row reside in the lower section, leaving the bottom row entirely empty. This supports placing up to three more dominos. Therefore, the conclusion here is that we can always place another domino without disturbing the already placed ones. **II. Solution:** 1. **Contrary Assumption:** Let's assume it's false, meaning 11 dominos can be placed on the board such that no more dominoes can be added. Consider a (2 times 3) rectangle at one corner of the chessboard. 2. **Rectangular Observation:** This rectangle contains at least one domino, as otherwise, the two squares marked with * (the ones at the corners of the (2 times 3) rectangle) would both be uncovered. Thus at least 3 squares in this (2 times 3) rectangle will be covered by dominos, including the one domino placed there. 3. **Application to Four-Corner Rectangles:** By this rectangle logic applied to all four corners, we guarantee at least 4 dominos cover these sub-regions. This provides a total of at least 16 covered squares across these four (2 times 3) zones, meaning the central (2 times 6) strip has, at most, 6 remaining covered squares. 4. **Puzzle Completion and Arrangement Analysis:** Given that fewer than 6 squares on this strip would result in uncovered neighbors thereby contradicting the assumption (since they could fit another domino), exactly 6 covered squares must be considered. These should arise through individual dominos instead of vertical placements among others already placed, revealing a contradiction: the totals should sum to more dominos than provided, implying the assumption was false. The initial postulation must be incorrect; thus we can always place an additional 12th domino on such a (6 times 6) chessboard while preserving the placement rules. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"A merchant marks goods up by some percentage and then offers a 30% discount on the marked price.

They can be arbitrarily placed within the constraints given. - Vertices can be placed in such a large manner that theoretically allows for infinitely many. 4. **Conclusion**: - The number of vertices the pyramid can have is unrestrictedly large; [ boxed{text{Arbitrarily large}} ] In summary, to both parts: - **Part (a)**: The maximum number of vertices = 13. - **Part (b)**: The number of vertices can be arbitrarily large."},{"prompt":"Solve the system of equations left{begin{array}{l} frac{x_{2} x_{3} x_{4} cdots x_{n}}{x_{1}}=a_{1} frac{x_{1} x_{3} x_{4} cdots x_{n}}{x_{2}}=a_{2} cdots cdots cdots cdots frac{x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} cdots x_{n1}}{x_{n}}=a_{n} end{array}right.","completion":"The given system of equations is: [ left{ begin{array}{l} frac{x_{2} x_{3} x_{4} cdots x_{n}}{x_{1}} = a_{1} frac{x_{1} x_{3} x_{4} cdots x_{n}}{x_{2}} = a_{2} cdots cdots cdots cdots frac{x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} cdots x_{n-1}}{x_{n}} = a_{n} end{array} right. ] We first examine the case where all (a_i > 0). 1. **Multiplying All Equations:** Consider the product of the left-hand sides of the equations and the product of the right-hand sides: [ left( frac{x_{2} x_{3} x_{4} cdots x_{n}}{x_{1}} right) cdot left( frac{x_{1} x_{3} x_{4} cdots x_{n}}{x_{2}} right) cdots left( frac{x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} cdots x_{n-1}}{x_{n}} right) = a_{1} a_{2} cdots a_{n} ] 2. **Simplifying the Expression:** Each (x_{i}) appears (n-1) times in the numerator and once in the denominator.

Now, we can find the total rent (R) of the pasture by setting up a proportion: C's oxen-months / Total oxen-months = C's rent / Total rent 45 / 175 = 45 / R Now, we can solve for R: 45 * R = 45 * 175 R = (45 * 175) / 45 R = 175 Therefore, the total rent of the pasture is Rs. boxed{175} ."},{"prompt":"f the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_{n}} is 3^{n}1, then the sum of the first n terms of the sequence left{{a_n^2}right} is A: frac{{{9^{n+1}}+15}{8}+n{3^{n+1}} B: frac{{{9^n}+15}{8}+n{3^n} C: frac{{{9^n}1}{4} D: frac{{{9^n}1}{2}","completion":"Given that the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_{n}} is S_{n}=3^{n}-1, we aim to find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence left{{a_n^2}right}. **Step 1: Determine a_{n}** First, let's calculate a_{1}: - For n=1, we have a_{1}=S_{1}=3^{1}-1=2.

This is because if they start on different colors, they will always be on different colors after each jump and can never meet in a single triangle. 4. **Feasibility of Meeting:** - Since any flea can go from any triangle to any other triangle (given enough jumps), we can pick any triangle and have all fleas go to it. - Once a flea reaches the target triangle, it can jump back and forth between the target triangle and one of its neighboring triangles to stay in the vicinity. 5. **Ensuring All Fleas Meet:** - Since the number of fleas is finite, and they can all be directed to the same triangle, eventually all the fleas will be on the same triangle after a finite number of jumps.

Let ( m ) be the number of times Kevin correctly counts by ( 11 ), and let ( n ) be the number of times he incorrectly counts by ( 9 ). The total count he ends up with is given by the equation: [ 11m + 9n = 2007 ] 2. To find the possible values of ( n ), we first reduce the equation modulo ( 11 ): [ 11m + 9n equiv 2007 pmod{11} ] Since ( 11m equiv 0 pmod{11} ), we have: [ 9n equiv 2007 pmod{11} ] 3. Next, we need to find ( 2007 mod 11 ). We do this by performing the division: [ 2007 div 11 = 182 quad text{with a remainder of} quad 2007 - 182 times 11 = 2007 - 2002 = 5 ] Therefore: [ 2007 equiv 5 pmod{11} ] 4.

According to Lucas' Theorem, a binomial coefficient ( binom{a}{b} ) modulo a prime ( p ) can be determined by expressing ( a ) and ( b ) in base ( p ) and examining the corresponding digits. 2. **Applying Lucas' Theorem:** Lucas' Theorem states that: [ binom{a}{b} equiv prod_{i=0}^k binom{a_i}{b_i} pmod{p} ] where ( a_i ) and ( b_i ) are the digits of ( a ) and ( b ) in base ( p ). For ( binom{2n}{n} ) to be not divisible by 11, each digit ( n_i ) in the base 11 representation of ( n ) must satisfy ( 2n_i < 11 ). 3. **Base 11 Representation:** For ( binom{2n}{n} ) to be not divisible by 11, ( n ) must be such that in its base 11 representation, each digit ( n_i ) satisfies ( 2n_i < 11 ). This means ( n_i ) can be any digit from 0 to 5. 4. **Counting Valid ( n ):** We need to count the number of integers ( n leq 1330 ) that satisfy the above condition. First, we convert 1330 to base 11: [ 1330_{10} = 1100_{11} ] This means we are looking for numbers ( n ) in the range ( 0 ) to ( 1100_{11} ) where each digit is between 0 and 5. 5. **Counting the Numbers:** - The number of valid ( n ) with 1 digit: ( 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) (6 numbers) - The number of valid ( n ) with 2 digits: ( 6 times 6 = 36 ) numbers - The number of valid ( n ) with 3 digits: ( 6 times 6 times 6 = 216 ) numbers - The number of valid ( n ) with 4 digits: ( 6 times 6 times 6 times 6 = 1296 ) numbers However, we need to exclude numbers greater than ( 1100_{11} ). The valid range is from ( 0000_{11} ) to ( 1100_{11} ). 6. **Excluding Invalid Numbers:** - Numbers from ( 1000_{11} ) to ( 1100_{11} ) are valid. - Numbers from ( 1101_{11} ) to ( 1330_{10} ) are invalid.

If both Tom and Linda travel indefinitely without changing their speeds or directions, what is the positive difference, in minutes, between the amount of time it takes Tom to cover half of the distance that Linda has covered and the amount of time it takes Tom to cover twice the distance that Linda has covered, considering their initial and current directions and speeds?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step. First, we calculate the distance Linda covers in the first 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 2 miles per hour: Distance = Speed × Time Distance_Linda_first = 2 mph × 0.5 hours = 1 mile After 30 minutes, Linda turns 45 degrees to the left and walks for another 1 hour at the same speed.

After the third replacement, the amount of honey left would be H * (1 - P)^3. After the fourth replacement, the amount of honey left would be H * (1 - P)^4.

By the angle bisector theorem, when an angle bisector divides an angle, the ratio of the opposite sides of the triangle remains the same as the ratio of the newly created segments by the angle bisector. Therefore, the ratio ( frac{QS}{RS} ) is equal to ( frac{PQ}{PR} ) or ( frac{20}{30} ).

From the first scenario, we know that P pumps working 8 hours a day can empty the tank in 2 days. This means that the total work done by P pumps in 2 days is equal to the capacity of the tank. We can express this as: Work done by P pumps in 2 days = P pumps * 8 hours/day * 2 days From the second scenario, we know that 8 pumps working 6 hours a day can empty the tank in 1 day. This means that the total work done by 8 pumps in 1 day is also equal to the capacity of the tank. We can express this as: Work done by 8 pumps in 1 day = 8 pumps * 6 hours/day * 1 day Since both scenarios result in the tank being emptied, the total work done in both scenarios is equal. Therefore, we can set the two expressions equal to each other: P pumps * 8 hours/day * 2 days = 8 pumps * 6 hours/day * 1 day Now, we can solve for P: P * 8 * 2 = 8 * 6 * 1 16P = 48 P = 48 / 16 P = 3 So, there are boxed{3} pumps in the first scenario."},{"prompt":"f ( n ) is a natural number, what is the last digit of ( n^{9999} n^{5555} )?

Since each goat costs 400, the additional cost for each llama is: 50% of 400 = 0.50 * 400 = 200 So each llama costs: 400 + 200 = 600 Now we can calculate the total cost for the llamas: 6 llamas * 600/llama = 3600 Finally, we add the cost of the goats and the llamas to find the total amount Tim spent: 1200 (goats) + 3600 (llamas) = 4800 Therefore, Tim spent boxed{4800} in total for the animals for his zoo."},{"prompt":"The quotient of two positive integers is frac{7}{3} and their product is 441.

What is his swimming speed in miles per hour?","completion":"First, let's convert Dan's average rate for the entire trip from miles per minute to miles per hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we multiply the average rate by 60: 0.125 miles/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 7.5 miles/hour This is Dan's average speed for the entire trip, which includes both running and swimming. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Dan to run and swim the 3-mile stretch. When running, Dan's speed is 10 miles per hour. To find the time it takes to run 3 miles, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed For running: Time_running = 3 miles / 10 miles/hour = 0.3 hours Now, let's denote Dan's swimming speed as S (in miles per hour). Using the same formula for the swimming part: Time_swimming = 3 miles / S The total time for the trip is the sum of the running and swimming times: Total_time = Time_running + Time_swimming Total_time = 0.3 hours + (3 miles / S) Since we know the average speed for the entire trip is 7.5 miles per hour, we can also calculate the total time using the total distance (which is 6 miles, because Dan travels 3 miles each way) and the average speed: Total_time = Total_distance / Average_speed Total_time = 6 miles / 7.5 miles/hour = 0.8 hours Now we can set the two expressions for Total_time equal to each other: 0.3 hours + (3 miles / S) = 0.8 hours To solve for S, we first isolate the term with S: (3 miles / S) = 0.8 hours - 0.3 hours (3 miles / S) = 0.5 hours Now we multiply both sides by S and divide by 0.5 hours to solve for S: 3 miles = 0.5 hours * S S = 3 miles / 0.5 hours S = 6 miles/hour So, Dan's swimming speed is boxed{6} miles per hour."},{"prompt":"Factor the following expression: 180b^2 + 36b.","completion":"To factor the expression 180b^2 + 36b, we first find the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients and the variable terms. 1.

Next, factor out 36b from each term: [ 180b^2 + 36b = 36b(5b + 1) ] We can verify the factorization by expanding: [ 36b(5b + 1) = 180b^2 + 36b ] Therefore, the factored form of the expression is: [ boxed{36b(5b + 1)} ] Conclusion: The problem was successfully factored by extracting the GCF and rewriting the terms accordingly."},{"prompt":"Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 4 books on it.

Given f(x) = x^3, the inverse function, f^{-1}(x), essentially reverses this operation. Thus, if f(x) = y, then f^{-1}(y) = x. For f(x) = x^3, we solve for x in terms of y: [y = x^3] Taking the cube root of both sides to solve for x, we get: [x = sqrt[3]{y}] This means that f^{-1}(y) = sqrt[3]{y}.

Since C = pi - (A+B), we have sin C = sin(pi - (A+B)) = sin(A+B). 2. Using the sine addition formula, sin(A+B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. 3. The given equation sin C = 2cos A sinleft(B+frac{pi}{3}right) can be expanded using the sine addition formula as well: [2cos Aleft(frac{1}{2}sin B + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos Bright) = cos A sin B + sqrt{3}cos A cos B]. 4. Equating the two expressions for sin C, we get sin A cos B + cos A sin B = cos A sin B + sqrt{3}cos A cos B. 5. Simplifying, we find that cos B(sin A - sqrt{3}cos A) = 0. From this, we have two possibilities: cos B = 0 or sin A - sqrt{3}cos A = 0. - If cos B = 0, then B = frac{pi}{2}, which contradicts the condition of triangle ABC being acute. Therefore, this case is discarded. - The remaining possibility is sin A - sqrt{3}cos A = 0, which simplifies to tan A = sqrt{3}. Given that 0 < A < frac{pi}{2}, we conclude that A = frac{pi}{3}. Therefore, A = boxed{frac{pi}{3}}. Part (2): 1. From part (1), we know cos A = frac{1}{2}. 2.

How long is the bridge?","completion":"First, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the length of the train and the time taken to cross the bridge. The conversion factor is: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in meters per second (m/s) is: 36 kmph * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 10 m/s Now, we know that the train takes 34.997200223982084 seconds to cross the bridge, and it is traveling at a speed of 10 m/s. The distance the train travels in this time is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 10 m/s * 34.997200223982084 seconds Distance = 349.97200223982084 meters This distance is the combined length of the train and the bridge. Since we know the length of the train is 200 meters, we can find the length of the bridge by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance. Length of the bridge = Distance - Length of the train Length of the bridge = 349.97200223982084 meters - 200 meters Length of the bridge = 149.97200223982084 meters Therefore, the length of the bridge is approximately boxed{149.97} meters."},{"prompt":"Brandon has a collection of 20 baseball cards.

After this, she donated 5% of her remaining allowance to a charity. Out of guilt and a sense of responsibility, she decides to save the rest. How much did she save?","completion":"First, let's calculate how much Annabelle spent on junk food. If she spent 40% of her 30 allowance, we calculate this as: 40% of 30 = (40/100) * 30 = 12 After spending 12 on junk food, she then spent another 8 on sweets. So the total amount spent on junk food and sweets is: 12 (junk food) + 8 (sweets) = 20 Now, let's find out how much allowance she has left after these expenses: 30 (initial allowance) - 20 (spent on junk food and sweets) = 10 remaining Next, Annabelle donates 5% of her remaining allowance to charity. To find out how much this is, we calculate: 5% of 10 = (5/100) * 10 = 0.50 So, she donates 0.50 to charity, leaving her with: 10 (remaining after junk food and sweets) - 0.50 (donation to charity) = 9.50 Therefore, Annabelle saves boxed{9.50} ."},{"prompt":"hopkeeper gave an additional 20 per cent concession on the reduced price after giving 30 per cent standard concession on an article . if arun bought that article for 1120 , what was the original price ?","completion":"Let's denote the original price of the article as P. First, the shopkeeper gives a 30% standard concession on the original price. This means the price after the first concession is: Price after 30% concession = P - (30/100 * P) = P - 0.3P = 0.7P Next, the shopkeeper gives an additional 20% concession on the reduced price. This means the price after the second concession is: Price after additional 20% concession = 0.7P - (20/100 * 0.7P) = 0.7P - 0.2 * 0.7P = 0.7P - 0.14P = 0.56P Arun bought the article for 1120, which is the price after both concessions. Therefore: 0.56P = 1120 To find the original price P, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.56: P = 1120 / 0.56 P = 2000 So, the original price of the article was boxed{2000} ."},{"prompt":"Consider the list of numbers 67, 6767, 676767, ..., up to 10 repetitions of '67'.

Assume he bought equal amounts of beans and rice.","completion":"Let c, b, and r be the number of pounds of corn, beans, and rice Ryan buys, respectively. Given b = r, we can express the conditions as: - c + b + r = 30 - 1.20c + 0.60b + 0.80r = 24.00 - b = r Using b = r, the equations simplify to: - c + 2b = 30 - 1.20c + 1.40b = 24.00 We can solve the system step by step. First, from c + 2b = 30, c = 30 - 2b. Plugging this into the second equation: 1.20(30 - 2b) + 1.40b = 24 36 - 2.40b + 1.40b = 24 36 - b = 24 Solving for b, we get: 36 - 24 = b b = 12 Substituting b = 12 back to find c: c = 30 - 2 times 12 = 6 So, Ryan buys 6 pounds of corn, 12 pounds of beans, and 12 pounds of rice. Confirm this satisfies the cost: - Corn: 6 times 1.20 = 7.2 - Beans: 12 times 0.60 = 7.2 - Rice: 12 times 0.80 = 9.6 Total cost: 7.2 + 7.2 + 9.6 = 24, which matches the given.

The term sin^2x can be rewritten using the double-angle formula as: sin^2x = frac{1 - cos 2x}{2} The cos 2x term has a minimum positive period of pi because cos has a period of 2pi and doubling the angle halves the period. Adding a constant c to a sine function doesn't affect its period. Therefore, the term c does not change the period of the function. Hence, the periodicity of f(x) is not related to c. The term bsin x has a minimum positive period of 2pi since the sine function itself has a period of 2pi, and multiplying by b (if b neq 0) doesn't affect its period, but rather simply scales the function. Therefore, when b = 0, the function simplifies to f(x) = sin^2x+c = frac{-cos 2x}{2} + frac{1}{2} + c with a minimum positive period of pi. When b neq 0, the term bsin x introduces a period of 2pi. Combining the periods of the cos 2x and bsin x terms, we find that the minimum positive period will be their least common multiple. Since pi is half of 2pi, if b is not zero, the period of f(x) is dominated by the sine term, resulting in a period of 2pi. Thus, the minimum positive period of f(x) is only related to b. boxed{text{B}} is the correct choice based on the properties of trigonometric functions."},{"prompt":"A man's regular pay is 3 per hour up to a certain number of hours.

Hence, as theta=c does not depend on r and z, it typically forms a plane that extends indefinitely in the r and z directions. 2. **z = ktheta Explanation**: Here z is directly proportional to theta. But as theta = c, substituting we get z = kc which states that z is a specific constant value (kc). 3. **Combination of Both**: Combining theta = c with z = kc geometrically restricts us to a set of points that make a specific constant angle c with the positive x-axis and also are at a specific height kc. These points form a line, which moves in a circle of any radius r, specifically at height z = kc. Conclusion: The intersection of a constant theta plane and z = kc (constant z) presents a fixed height circle in 3D space, forming a circumference, counted infinitely since r varies from 0 to infty. However, the result might be confusing as it indeed draws a line over the cylindrical surface at a fixed height.

The LCM of 150 and 100 can be found by prime factorization: 150 = 2 * 3 * 5^2 100 = 2^2 * 5^2 The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in either number: LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 5^2 = 4 * 3 * 25 = 300 seconds So, A and B will meet for the first time at the starting point after 300 seconds, which is 5 minutes (since 300 seconds / 60 seconds per minute = boxed{5} minutes)."}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function W(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
