Though it's challenging to encapsulate every minute nuance, several key reasons contributed significantly to the conclusion of this era: 1. **Soviet Economic Stagnation:** The Soviet Union's economy, burdened by the massive costs of the arms race, failed to keep up with that of the Western powers, particularly in areas of consumer goods and technological innovation. This stagnation made it increasingly difficult for the Soviet government to maintain its military spending and uphold the promises of socialism. 2. **Reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev:** After coming to power in 1985, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced major reforms under the policies of perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness). His efforts aimed at restructuring the Soviet economy and making the Soviet political environment more open and transparent significantly changed the political landscape within the USSR and its relationship with the West. 3. **Eastern European Revolutions:** Starting in 1989, a series of revolutions swept across Eastern Europe, leading to the fall of communist governments in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Many of these revolutions were largely peaceful, such as those in Czechoslovakia (the Velvet Revolution) and East Germany, which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 and eventually German reunification in 1990. 4. **The Fall of the Berlin Wall:** The demolition of the Berlin Wall, which had served as the most potent symbol of the Cold War division between East and West, marked a significant turning point. It not only symbolized the failure of communist isolation but also galvanized further democratic movements within the Eastern Bloc. 5. **Nationalism and Independence Movements within the USSR:** The Baltics and other regions within the Soviet Union began to assert their desire for independence, fueled by Gorbachev’s policies of glasnost and perestroika, further weakening the Soviet Union’s hold on its satellite states and its own national territories. 6. **The Afghan War:** The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the subsequent war until their withdrawal in 1989 drained Soviet resources and morale, akin to the impact of the Vietnam War on the United States. It was a costly and unpopular war that further exacerbated the USSR’s economic and political problems. 7. **Diplomatic Efforts and Arms Reduction Treaties:** A series of negotiations and treaties aimed at reducing the nuclear arsenals and easing tensions between the superpowers, such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 1987, played a crucial role. These efforts were particularly championed by Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan and later George H.W. Bush. 8. **Changes in U.S. Policies:** The shift in the United States' approach towards the Soviet Union, especially under the Reagan administration, which initially took a hardline strategy but later engaged more constructively with Gorbachev's reformist USSR, helped ease hostilities. 9. **Soviet Union’s Dissolution:** The culmination of these economic issues, internal unrest, reform attempts, and loss of control over satellite states led to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The emergence of Boris Yeltsin as a key figure in Russian politics and the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union effectively dissolved, marked the end of the Cold War era. These primary factors, among others, contributed to the complex and multifaceted process that led to the end of the Cold War. The collapse was not the result of a single event or moment but rather a gradual process influenced by a confluence of internal and external pressures."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They are able to tackle complex problems with ease and showcase their knowledge with poise. In terms of volition, they are flexible and open-minded, willing to adapt their approach in order to achieve their goals. However, when it comes to emotions, FVEL tends to be insecure and unsure of themselves, often experiencing self-doubt and anxiety. Despite this, their logic remains unbothered and clear, allowing them to make rational decisions and problem-solve effectively."},{"prompt":"Assign it with MBTI and enneagram","completion":"Based on the characteristics described, FVEL could be associated with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) type of ENTJ (Extroverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging) and the Enneagram Type 3 (The Achiever). ENTJs are known for their confidence, logical thinking, and ability to lead with a clear vision. They are often goal-oriented and decisive, which aligns with the description of FVEL in terms of confident physics and unbothered logic. Enneagram Type 3 individuals, also known as Achievers, are ambitious, success-oriented, and adaptable. They strive for achievement and recognition, and are often driven by a desire to excel and be the best in their field, which corresponds with FVEL's flexible volition and goal-driven mindset.

Thorough and careful planning is essential to the flow of the project and the success of the student. In the beginning, children use organizers to isolate an inquiry question. They then brainstorm what their procedure will be for research and identify the materials that they will need to do their research. Next, students select a way to display what they have learned in the form of a project. A target audience with whom to share their project is selected, ranging from their peers, to the principal, to their parents. The audience must be authentic and appropriate. For example, if students are working on a science inquiry on the topic of energy, they may choose to research how to harness hydropower to make a machine. A group may elect to make a working catapult. The culmination of the project might be a contest to see how far they can catapult a ball or an egg, with the class as the audience. Accountability to an audience coupled with a due date keeps students on track.","completion":"PBL包含若干阶段。每个阶段都必须及时完成。深入而谨慎的规划对于项目的推进和学生的成功至关重要。一开始，孩子们使用组织者来确定一个探究问题。然后他们大脑风暴，规划他们研究的程序并找出他们需要进行研究的材料。接下来，学生们选择一种方式来展示他们学到的知识，形成一个项目。他们选择一个目标受众，可以是同龄人、校长，或是父母等。受众必须真实且合适。例如，如果学生们正在进行一个有关能源话题的科学探究，他们可能选择研究如何利用水力发电制作机器。一个小组可以选择制作一个真实可运作的弹射器。项目的高潮可能是比赛，看看他们能够多远地投射一个球或一个鸡蛋，全班同学作为观众。对于受众的责任和截止日期让学生保持在正确的轨道上。"},{"prompt":"Learning responsibility, independence, and discipline are three outcomes of PBL. The organizational blueprint that students have designed for themselves guides them and allows them to stay focused and on-task. As children become more proficient in the PBL approach, they learn to self-monitor their progress through daily agenda setting. At the end of each work session, students report on whether they have met their goals for the day. Students must use their work time effectively and stay focused and on-task to succeed. Goal setting helps students learn to manage their own time. It is important for the teacher to confer with students regularly to ensure that students are on track and developing their ideas and skills fully. These skills are critical for future success in both school and life.","completion":"PBL的三个成果是学习责任感、独立性和纪律性。学生们为自己设计的组织蓝图指导着他们，让他们保持专注和任务导向。当孩子们在PBL方法上变得更加熟练时，他们学会通过每日议程设定来自我监控进展。在每个工作会话结束时，学生们要报告他们是否达到了当天的目标。学生们必须有效利用他们的工作时间、保持专注和任务导向才能成功。设定目标帮助学生学会管理自己的时间。老师定期与学生交流非常重要，以确保学生走在正确的轨道上，全面发展他们的想法和技能。这些技能对于未来在学校和生活中取得成功至关重要。"},{"prompt":"Students learn accountability with PBL through the daily goal setting, as well as through expectations of their peers. When students work collaboratively, there is an expectation that each child will contribute to the project equally. The group dynamic creates an interdependent team in which students must each do their part, and as a result, a natural consequence exists for those students who do not demonstrate accountability—others may no longer want to be paired with students who do not do their fair share. Therefore, peer pressure contributes to the accomplishment of ongoing group tasks throughout the learning process and the culmination of a successful final product. Students are conscientious because they must complete their project in the allotted time. They can be incredibly resourceful when time is of the essence. Accountability to peers often has greater consequences and provides more motivation for students than if they were only responsible to the teacher. Children do not want to let their friends down.","completion":"学生通过PBL的日常目标设定以及对同龄人的期望，学习责任感。当学生合作工作时，有一个期望，即每个孩子都要平等地贡献到项目中。小组动态创造出一个相互依存的团队，学生们必须各自尽自己的一份责任，因此，对于那些未展现责任感的学生，存在一个自然的后果——其他人可能不再愿意与不尽公平份额的学生合作。因此，同龄人的压力有助于在整个学习过程中完成持续的小组任务，以及最终成功的产物。学生们要有责任感是因为他们必须在规定的时间内完成他们的项目。当时间紧迫时，他们可以变得非常有创造力。对同龄人的责任感常常具有更大的后果，为学生提供了比仅对老师负责更多的动机。孩子们不想让他们的朋友失望。"},{"prompt":"Project-Based Learning for the 21st Century: Skills for the Future","completion":"21世纪的项目式学习：未来的技能"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши от первого лица. Пиши эмоционально с раздражением про невыносимые условия. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Странный автосалон, реально странный. Хотел купить у них Lada Vesta SW Cross — по заявке 1300000 р с хвостиком. Типа 8 цветов наличии, выбрал черную. Говорят черные 1658000 р, дефицитный цвет. Ну и с кредитом протащили. Заявку подал в сбер на авто под 9% через них, отказали. Первый автомобиль по автокредиту должен быть меньше миллиона. Менеджеры гнали на банк. И предложили потребительскую хню под 27%. через свои каналы. Название банка до этого ни разу не слышал. Неоправданно дорого и не вызывает доверия. Слишком большая выплата в месяц получается. Не стал связываться. Атмосфера в салоне болото. Видно, что пытаются нажиться и менеджеры из кожи лезут, чтобы впарить свой кредит даже в ущерб здравому смыслу. но получается через пень колоду — раз за разом-то одно и тоже и еще через клиента или даже чаще отказы получать. Злятся и выходят из себя. Не посоветую.","completion":"1. Никогда бы не подумал, что покупка машины превратится в кошмар, но в салоне Декар это стало реальностью. Приглянулся мне Renault Kaptur, на сайте указали соблазнительную цену, но когда дело дошло до покупки, оказалось, что добавляются непонятные сборы, которые увеличивают стоимость на 20%! И при этом менеджеры умудрились предложить мне страховку вдвое дороже рыночной цены. Пытался добиться справедливости, но все было безтолку, только нервы потратил. Чувствую себя полностью обманутым и оставляю это как предупреждение для других. 2. Вот это разочарование… Думал, что в салоне Декар смогу легко и быстро оформить покупку Hyundai Elantra, которую выбрал еще до того, как пришел. Однако, столкнулся с абсолютно беспомощными менеджерами, которые либо не могли ответить на простые вопросы, либо пытались подсунуть мне явно ненужные опции. К тому же, после оглашения итоговой цены шок – оказалось на 25% выше обещанной! Видимо, их тактика – сначала заманить клиента низкой ценой, а затем выкачивать деньги. Ужасно раздражает такое отношение! 3. Похоже, что в салоне Декар ценят не клиентов, а свой кошелек. Иначе как объяснить, что за Volkswagen Polo мне насчитали цену на 30% дороже, чем было заявлено изначально? И это не считая того, что предлагаемые опции к авто оказались втридорога! Менеджеры, кажется, игнорировали все мои запросы и замечания, зато с энтузиазмом навязывали дорогие сервисы. Ощущение, будто ты не покупатель, а капля в море их прибылей. Настоятельно не рекомендую иметь дело с этим салоном - только потратите время и деньги. 4. Самая ужасная покупка в моей жизни произошла именно в салоне Декар. Планировал приобрести Mazda CX-5, но в итоге столкнулся с абсурдными манипуляциями со стороны менеджеров. Причем до того, как огласили итоговую цену, мне втридорога насчитали стоимость страховки и затем влепили штраф за якобы поздний отказ от сделки, когда я попытался отказаться из-за завышенной стоимости. Чувствовал себя как в ловушке, где каждый поворот – очередной способ выманить у меня деньги. Пожалуйста, обходите этот салон стороной. 5. Это был абсолютный ад, а не покупка автомобиля в салоне Декар. Решил купить Skoda Octavia, всё казалось нормальным до момента, когда начали появляться скрытые платежи. За каждую мелочь требовали доплату, а финальная стоимость оказалась на 40% выше, чем уверяли вначале. К тому же, когда я начал выражать свое возмущение, менеджеры оказались крайне грубы и непрофессиональны. Полный кошмар и разочарование. Любым способом пытаются выманить деньги. Никому не советую связываться с этим салоном!"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

做空中国金融市场的金融工具","completion":"做空中国金融市场意味着投资者通过出售其预期下跌的资产来盈利。由于市场、法规和可用金融产品的不断变化，请注意我的回答是基于2023年4月的信息，随时间的变化，具体的投资工具和方法可能会有所不同。 截至目前，做空中国金融市场的金融工具主要包括： 1. **做空中国股票的交易所交易基金（ETFs）**：这些是在美国等地上市的ETF，允许投资者通过做空某一指数来投资中国市场。例如，做空沪深300指数的ETF。这些基金通过使用衍生品如期货和期权来实现做空的效果。 2. **期货和期权**：投资者可以通过交易在香港或其他国际衍生品市场上的中国股指期货和期权来做空中国股市。例如，恒生中国企业指数（H股指数）期货和期权就是一个例子，通过这些工具，投资者可以放空与该指数挂钩的资产。 3. **逆向ETFs**：这些特殊的ETF设计用来跟踪其基准的相反表现。例如，如果基准指数下跌，逆向ETF的价值就会上升。这样的ETF可以针对特定的中国市场指数，为希望做空中国市场的投资者提供方便。 4. **借贷股票进行卖空**：对于有能力参与更复杂交易的投资者，直接通过证券账户借入希望下跌的中国公司的股票，并将其卖出，等股价下跌时再买回还给借贷方，从中获益。 5. **差价合约（CFD）**：CFD是一种金融衍生品，它允许投资者对股票、商品、指数等资产的价格变动进行投机，而无需拥有这些资产。通过CFD，投资者可以做空中国的股票或指数，以期在价格下跌时获利。 请注意，做空市场或特定资产涉及高风险，因为理论上，做空的损失可能是无限的（因为价格上涨没有上限）。此外，上述某些工具可能涉及高级投资策略，适用于有经验的投资者。在涉足这些市场之前，进行充分的研究和风险评估非常重要。此外，不同国家的监管机构对这类投资活动的态度不同，应确保符合当地法律法规。"},{"prompt":"ETF代码是什么","completion":"提供具体ETF代码前，需要明确一点：ETF（交易所交易基金）的代码和名称会根据它们交易的证券交易所而异。因此，针对之前提及的**做空中国金融市场**的ETF，我不能提供具体的实时代码而不知道您感兴趣的具体市场或指数。此外，新的ETF可能会推出，而旧的ETF可能会停止交易，因此任何提供的ETF代码都可能随时间发生变化。 举例来说，针对中国或香港市场的逆向ETF（做空ETF）、做空或逆向ETF在美国市场上可能较为常见，但需要特别注意的是，具体ETF的表现、策略和风险特征。 例如，对于希望追踪中国大盘股票并且提供相反表现的逆向ETF，投资者可能会找到像Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bear 1X Shares（代码：CHAD），这只ETF旨在提供与沪深300指数相反的日收益。 另外，对于投资者而言，重要的是了解ETF的具体投资目标、风险因素以及它是如何管理的。不同的做空ETF会采取不同的策略来实现其目标，这些策略可能包括使用衍生品如期权和期货，或者通过借股票来卖空。这些因素都可能对ETF的风险和回报特性产生影响。 注意：在考虑投资任何ETF，包括做空中国市场的ETF之前，至关重要的是需要做深入研究，并考虑咨询金融顾问。投资总是伴随风险，尤其是涉及做空或使用杠杆的金融工具时更是如此。"},{"prompt":"没有CHAD","completion":"抱歉，我之前提到的CHAD ETF是用作示例，没有准确地反映当前市场上实际可用的做空中国相关ETF。ETF（交易所交易基金）的名称和代码可能会随着时间和市场条件的变化而变化，这意味着可用的ETF和其相应的特征可能有所不同。 如果你对做空中国金融市场或特定股票指数感兴趣，那么你需要查找当前可用的产品。例如，在美国市场上，存在着许多旨在提供中国市场指数（如沪深300指数或恒生指数）相反表现的逆向ETF或做空ETF。 为了找到最新的、特定目的的ETF，我建议： 1. **使用金融新闻网站和市场研究工具**：像彭博、路透和雅虎财经等平台通常可以提供最新的ETF信息和数据。 2. **直接访问ETF发行商的网站**：如Direxion、ProShares等是知名的做空和杠杆ETF提供者，他们会在官方网站列出旗下的ETF产品，并提供详细的产品说明和市场表现数据。 3. **咨询专业的金融顾问或经纪人**：他们通常具有最新的市场信息，并能提供专业的投资建议。 请记住，在考虑任何形式的投资，特别是做空和使用杠杆的ETF投资时，了解相关产品的风险是非常重要的。这类投资可能会带来高风险，包括损失部分或全部投资资金的可能性。因此，确保你完全理解你所考虑的投资产品，并考虑是否适合你的投资目标和风险承受能力。"},{"prompt":"아래 내용중에 가장 간단하게 사용하는 방법이 무엇일까? # Whisper [[Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/whisper) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) [[Model card]](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md) [[Colab example]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/whisper/blob/master/notebooks/LibriSpeech.ipynb) Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. Approach ![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png) A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets. Setup We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI's tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command: pip install -U openai-whisper Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies: pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run: pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git It also requires the command-line tool [\`ffmpeg\`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers: \`\`\`bash # on Ubuntu or Debian sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg # on Arch Linux sudo pacman -S ffmpeg # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) brew install ffmpeg # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) choco install ffmpeg # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/) scoop install ffmpeg \`\`\` You may need [\`rust\`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the \`pip install\` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the \`PATH\` environment variable, e.g. \`export PATH=\\"HOME/.cargo/bin:PATH\\"\`. If the installation fails with \`No module named 'setuptools_rust'\`, you need to install \`setuptools_rust\`, e.g. by running: \`\`\`bash pip install setuptools-rust \`\`\` Available models and languages There are five model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model; actual speed may vary depending on many factors including the available hardware. | Size | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed | |:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:| | tiny | 39 M | \`tiny.en\` | \`tiny\` | ~1 GB | ~32x | | base | 74 M | \`base.en\` | \`base\` | ~1 GB | ~16x | | small | 244 M | \`small.en\` | \`small\` | ~2 GB | ~6x | | medium | 769 M | \`medium.en\` | \`medium\` | ~5 GB | ~2x | | large | 1550 M | N/A | \`large\` | ~10 GB | 1x | The \`.en\` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the \`tiny.en\` and \`base.en\` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the \`small.en\` and \`medium.en\` models. Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of \`large-v3\` and \`large-v2\` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356), as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3. ![WER breakdown by language](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/266841/f4619d66-1058-4005-8f67-a9d811b77c62) Command-line usage The following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the \`medium\` model: whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model medium The default setting (which selects the \`small\` model) works well for transcribing English. To transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language using the \`--language\` option: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese Adding \`--task translate\` will translate the speech into English: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese --task translate Run the following to view all available options: whisper --help See [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) for the list of all available languages. Python usage Transcription can also be performed within Python: \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") result = model.transcribe(\\"audio.mp3\\") print(result[\\"text\\"]) \`\`\` Internally, the \`transcribe()\` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window. Below is an example usage of \`whisper.detect_language()\` and \`whisper.decode()\` which provide lower-level access to the model. \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") # load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds audio = whisper.load_audio(\\"audio.mp3\\") audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio) # make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device) # detect the spoken language _, probs = model.detect_language(mel) print(f\\"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}\\") # decode the audio options = whisper.DecodingOptions() result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options) # print the recognized text print(result.text) \`\`\` More examples Please use the [🙌 Show and tell](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) category in Discussions for sharing more example usages of Whisper and third-party extensions such as web demos, integrations with other tools, ports for different platforms, etc. License Whisper's code and model weights are released under the MIT License.

I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that. I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do that.

I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to do this. I’m not so natural that I’m able to do that. I just want you to just do it. Oh, by the halo. Oh, I don’t think there’s anything wrong. second. Oh, by the halo. I don’t think there’s that. You have really lost many of our members now. You are really lost. Yes, indeed. Or you want me to just leave those members earlier. Bring carrotethers. OK, let’s look at these. Okay. So everyone’s are great gestions. As far as you know, the year about 100 people, so there is a really big course. I’m sorry, but that’s that’s how it works. So you can read it. I will not this today. I can’t but so basically every course will be recorded. So I will go through the zoom. And then I will upload the video after the class. Probably one day after the class. So you can take a look again. I strongly recommend you to come to the class offline. And obviously I will use the electric attendance check system to check your attendance. And that’s going to be part of your grades, not that much, but small. But still that’s very important. But just in case you have some occasion and you cannot attend the course of frying, you can use online video to study by yourself. Sounds good. So this is quite important. You have to know calculus and linear algebra and also probability already. So I try my best to explain some necessary subject before I go into the concept. But if you don’t know those if you haven’t taken those courses before I recommend not to take this course. It’s up to you. I mean, you can take your own risk, but you shouldn’t complain that the course is too hard. Does make sense? You can study these topics first and then take this course later. So this course is. You will be there is going to be a lot of mathematics and also some probability and linear algebra. So hopefully your family with the topics already. And we’re going to have programming homework. So the target I mean, this course is cornerstone means you have to do some project or assignments. And I’m not going to do any project because I don’t know about it. You guys are great. So your business or I don’t want to give more pressure to your workload. But we need to do some programming assignments. Then every program assignments will be based on the Python. So if you don’t know about Python, you shouldn’t take this course. Sorry. That’s good. Any questions about background? And you have to do the English on me. I explain already. And exam is also English. You have to write answers in English. Everything is English except for live interaction with you guys. You can ask questions Korean. But I will use English. But sometimes I can use Korean to explain better. But I guess maybe 99% will be English. I know my English is not really good. But I try to slow. So that you can understand what I’m trying to say. That’s the most important thing. I change my mind this morning. So you’re going to have four programs. And then I just have to do the math assignments. 10% the attendance plus your participation. So if you ask questions or if you answer my question, then you will get some little bonus. important points at the end. And there is an electronic system in the back. So before you come to the tips, you have to check. You know how to use the app, right? So I’ve done this for about two or three years already. And I know the first class, there are a lot of people, like 100 students. And sometimes some students just check there and then just go away. It’s up to you. But sometimes I, but sometimes I call your name, maybe once or twice as a matter. And if you try to cheat, maybe you’re being trouble. But do you know that? And homework. 40%. So 10 points for homework. And so I want to do a lot of homework. But the thing is, you can’t do 100 students homework like every week. We don’t have that much research. If you want to learn more, you can do yourself. You can study by yourself. If I don’t ask you to do something. But there will be four homeworks. And try to exam 50% and there’s no meat term. It’s difficult for you. So. Yeah. So T first. We have two. Is it here? No, no. So you should contact T first. I will. You know, I will. I mean, there are my greatest. And I will talk with them. A weekly basis. So I will know the issues and the homeworks, whatever. But please use email. And with this. So that line. Start with this. This point. Otherwise, you may may not. We send to T on me. And so I will not check the icon for the message. So please don’t send the icon for the message to you. So this is. Temporal schedule. It may change over time. But topics are pretty obvious. So we are going to do basic machine learning and foundation behind the method. And. So first we start from linear regression. And also some optimization method. And then we are going to look at some probabilistic interpretation. And. And we’re going to learn how to do classification. It’s logistic regression. And then we are going to look at regularization. And also from generative learning algorithm. And meet on break. We don’t have any midterm exam. So just you can take some break. And then. Two neural networks. And also SDM support that come. And then on spot is learning came in. Caution, visual model. And expectation. Maximization, I go into. And finally, we’re going to do some dimensionally reduction. PCA and some others. So that’s my schedule. But it can be changed over time, depending on the schedule. So, I’m going to do some other issues. So. So from this year. The 16 weeks. For every course. And the final week. There’s going to be final exam. And. Yeah. And those are some reference. So if you want to study very hard, maybe you can read. Some textbook. And the CS 2 to 9 lecture. It’s very useful information. And I will also follow those lecture notes from time to time. So that’s also great. Way to learn. And. CS 4780. This is a great. And you can have YouTube lectures. So if you want, you can take a look. And also a lot of. Text book from. So classical textbook. From Bishop and Murphy and others. Any question about course logistics. Yep. Yeah. Only. Yeah. Only. Yeah. Have you taken linear algebra course. I think that should be okay. Good. Yeah, I think that should be fine. But again, it’s up to you. If you if you think you’re in that uniform, you can study by yourself before the course starts. Any other questions. Yeah. Yes. Yes. So every slide will be on. I will try my best. So most of the lectures slide before the class. I cannot guarantee. That’s right. Any other questions. No. So. My goal is to finish today by one. I’m going to. By the way, have you taken my undergraduate course. I see three zero forty five. Raise your hand if you take. If you took that course, please don’t take this course. So there are a lot of materials are redundant. Right. These need to leave it out of the band stand under the course. The contents are about the same. I don’t recommend you to take both courses. So usually first week. I don’t do any lecture, but I introduce. I’m going to do some examples of what we can do with machine learning. To motivate you to study hard. So I’m going to do some examples of what we can do. I’m going to study in this class because this course is about. Very basic methods before the team learning. Most of the listen machine learning breaks. But the contents that we are going to learn into course is. Literally, it’s a foundation. So you should know the concepts. Actually, before you study the dim learning and most, you know, listen techniques. But most of the example that I’m showing is basically all dim learning. And we are going to recover some neural network, which is the dim learning for two weeks, I guess. But that’s really basic stuff. And if you’re, if you’re hot about, you know, transformer or CNN, whatever, you know, fancy architecture, the people are talking about. It’s not covered by this course. If you’re a study that for the topics. You have to take that courses. We have a lot of course offerings in SKK. There are a lot of, you know, YouTube material, you can take a look. So object detection. It’s a very simple concept in given an image. Then machine learning or AI system is going to produce the bounding boxes and also laborers and so on. So there are a lot of information here, right? There’s car here in the stop sign. And then you can also throw, you know, load line in the load. So this object detection technique is called a technique of the self driving cars. And every self-train car company are using this technique. And another example. It’s called image segmentation. And given an image. And you’re going to labor able to pixel. So the AI of the machine learning is going to tell you which picture. Which category this picture belongs to. And this is person. And this is car. And this is tree. And this is load and so on. So image segmentation is also being used in many practical application, including self-train cars and others. And human pose automation. So many practical applications are related to what human do. And we can estimate the skeleton of the human pose so that we can use this technique to interact. So I don’t know some games or some metaverse. So detection segmentation and pose automation. Those are something that. Machine learning system. Recognize some concept in the image. But now this as you are know, generative model is getting really important. And. This images. And not the real images. This is images that produced by. Machine learning model. Actually, this is quite old. It’s already. This is. This is called dog ball. It’s dog and it’s a tennis ball. Any obviously this image doesn’t exist. You exist in the world. So there’s a kind of evidence that. Machine learning system can actually. Interest. Some new concept. Whether they memorize the training. If you are not example. This task is called novel view synthesis. Basically you take a picture of the same. And then some. Machine learning system. Take these images. For example, here. Maybe around. Say you were 30 images around the same from different view perspective. And then the machine learning can generate the infinite number of views. So basically can generate novel view images. Even though you never seen that images from your training. The pictures you take. It’s quite realistic. You can also express some reflectance here. And also, ML. And then you can. And then you can. Explain a really important role in medical images. Nowadays. Medical image analysis. The accuracy is going to be more than higher than 95% or something. It’s almost similar to what. That’s what. The doctor said. And. There are many startups and be companies to try to apply these techniques to. In real medical situation. And then you can actually detect. Some cancers and other disease. That doctors cannot recognize in your eye. It’s quite useful. The basically what happened in practice is that. The AI let doctors know that these regions might be. So suspicious. Then doctor take a look and double check. And maybe take another. Images. And so on. So they will improve. The. Their process. This is not surprising anymore because of such a pity. But even maybe three or four years ago. And then. And then. This is. Gmail. I’m using this all the time. So if you type a little bit, then. The ML automatically. Complete your sentence. And this is quite interesting example because. You type, you know, talk about your stay. And then. ML. Know the contents. And then it’s such as your. A completion of your. And co pilot. And you have used this one. When you call. It’s very useful. And. If you type some prompt here, just. Code function prototype. Then ML automatically complete. And. The rest of the code. This is working really good. And. I was told that. Once you start this. Program. Then you never go back to before. But it is really convenient. And Amazon Alexa Google Home. There are a lot of. A year of seasons. You can actually talk to an internet. To do something. I think that’s from our country. How I think. And Alpha goal. It’s already. Seven or eight years ago. 2015 or 16. I remember. And. And. For the first time. AI system. Bit. The human expert. And this game is so complex. And the number of complications. You can actually think of. It’s people say it’s more than. Number of Adam in the universe. You can actually do. For search. To. Simulator entire game. So. Pattern. You learn from the. The games. And. Was really surprising. And I remember at the time. The alpha. Alpha. Bit. This is all. Four to. One. The list. Only one. One game. But it turns out that they were so. And. Actually, big. The old version of Alpha goal. Maybe hundred to zero. The human is nowhere close to their. Performance. I made this slide maybe two years ago. I feel like all the contents are really out of date. You know, I mean. I have to think. And. So the. I spoke Google. And then it bit the human. Human professional player. It’s a little bit different than Alpha goal. Because the. The game is set. It doesn’t give you the full information. Right. The. If you look at this map, you can only see the map close to what. Where you are. And you have to guess what’s happening. In the high date area. So it’s a. The. The. The partially observable environment. And also. The actions pace. The. The controller space that you have to pick is really huge. Compared to. The goal or other simple games. It’s pretty impressive. And this is robot. Trying to the Rubik’s cube. And this robot is called shadow hands. And they have about the same number of. But the joints, the human fingers have. And they also have some contact sensors that they can feel something that they contact with them. And this is really. This is only seven years ago. But when first I can I saw this. This. The charity is really surprising. Right. They can. So in this is control program from robotics. And the people have tried this. This control forever. And they never imagined this is going to happen. But. This is based on the reinforcement running. It’s based on the simulation. And then you train your reinforcement system based on millions of. Trier. Without. Actually having the real robots. They apply the learn system to the real robot. And it’s kind of works. And self-taughting carditions obviously good example. And it’s also really hard problem. Did you guys hear the news that Apple. The car business. That means it’s really hard. And it’s the way more from Google. Tesla and geocrystance. They’re all good company. But it’s still far from. The 100% self-driving. Another example. Google has their own. The process. It’s similar to the chip. That. When they make their. AI processor. They use AI techniques to. Do something. Actually, I don’t know what they are trying to do. But some layout problem is really hard. But they said. The AI is much. Not much. But a little bit better than human can do. In their chip designing. This is another example. And alpha for. I’m going to show. The video. This is required. What’s the building. So I will play this video. I play this video. Every course. Then I’m teaching. I’m teaching. I’m teaching. We’ve discovered more about the world than any other civilization before us. But we have been stuck on this one problem. How the proteins follow. How the proteins go from a string of amino acids to a compact shape that acts as a machine. And drives life. When you find out about proteins, it is very exciting. You could think of them as little biological matter machines. And the building blocks that borrow everything living on the planet. If we can reliably predict protein structures using AI, that could change the way we understand the natural world. Protein folding is one of these holy grail type problems in biology. We’ve always hypothesized that AI should be helpful to make these kinds of big scientific breakthroughs more quickly. And then I’ll probably be looking up little to an end that might make it difficult. It should be causing this to come on at a back up. We’ve been working on our system alpha fold really hard now for over two years. Rather than having to do painstaking experiments in the future, biologists might be able to instead rely on AI methods to directly predict structures quickly and efficiently. Generally speaking, biologists tend to be quite skeptical of computational work. And I think that skepticism is healthy and I respect it. But I feel very excited about what alpha fold can achieve. The task is when we say, look, deep mind is doing protein folding. This is how good we are and maybe it’s better than everybody else. Maybe it doesn’t. We decided to enter cast competition because it represented the Olympics of protein folding. Yes, we started to try and speed up the solution to the protein folding problem. When we started cast in 1994, I certainly was naive about how hard this was going to be. It was very cumbersome to do that because it took a long time. Let’s see what we’re doing still to quickly. Typically a hundred different groups from around the world participating cast. And we take a set of 100 proteins and we ask the groups to send us what they think the structures look like. We can reach 57.9 GDT on cast well ground truth. Has a metric on which you will be scored, which is this GDT metric. On a scale of zero to 100, you would expect a GDT over 90 to be a solution to the problem. If we do achieve this, this has incredible medical relevance. The implications are immense from how diseases progress, how you can discover new drugs. It’s endless. I wanted to make a really simple system in the results of them surprisingly good. The team got some results with a new technique not only as it were accurate, but as much faster than the old system. I think we’ll substantially see what we’re doing right now. So then it’s going to be a game, game changer, I think. In cast 13, something very significant had happened. For the first time, we saw the effective application of artificial intelligence. We’ve advanced the state of the art in the field, so that’s fantastic. But we still have a long way to go before we’ve solved it. The shapes were now approximately correct for many of the proteins, but the details exactly where each atom sits, which is really what we would call a solution, were not yet there. It doesn’t help if you have the tallest ladder when you’re going to the moon. We hit a little bit of a brick wall since we won cast. Then it was back to the drawing board and like brought out new ideas. And then it’s taken a little while, I would say for them to get back to where they were, but with the new ideas. And then now I think we’re seeing the benefits of the new ideas, they can go further. So that’s a really important moment. I will see that moment so many times now, but I know what that means now. And I know this is the time now to press. We need to double down and go as fast as possible from here. I think we’ve got no time to lose. So the intention is to intercast again. As if it’s deeply stressful. There’s something we’re going on with the learning because it is learning something is correlated with GDT, but it’s not calibrated. I feel slightly uncomfortable. We should be learning this, you know, in the blink of an eye. The technology advancing outside deep mind is also doing incredible work. And there’s always the possibility another team has come somewhere out left field that we don’t even know about. Someone asked me, well, should we panic now? Of course, we should have been panicking before. It does seem to do better, but still doesn’t do quite as well as the best model. So it looks like there’s room for improvement. There’s always a risk that you’ve missed something. And that’s why blind assessments like Casper so important to validate whether or results are real. Obviously I’m excited to see how Casper 14 goes. My expectation is we go heads down, we focus on the full goal, which is solve the whole problem. The Prime Minister has announced the most drastic limits to our lives that the UK has ever seen in living memory. I’m going to give the British people a very simple instruction. You must stay at Alan. We were prepared for Casper to start on April 15th because that’s when it was originally scheduled to start. And it’s been delayed by a month due to coronavirus. I really miss everyone. No struggle a little bit just kind of getting into a routine, especially my wife. She came down with the virus. And we luckily didn’t turn out to be serious. Casper started on Monday. Can I just check this diagram you’ve got here John, this one where we ask ground truth. This is one we’ve done badly on. We’re actually quite good on this region. If you imagine that we hadn’t have said it came around this way, but had put it in that instead. Yeah. One of the hardest proteins we’ve gotten in Casper thus far is a source call 2 protein called or fake. Orphate is a coronavirus protein. We tried really hard to improve our prediction. Like really, really hard. Probably the most time that we have ever spent on a single target. So we’re about two thirds of the way through Casper. And we’ve gotten three answers back. We now have the ground truth for orphate, which is one of the coronavirus proteins. And it turns out we did really well in predicting that. Amazing job everyone. The whole team. It’s been incredible efforts. Here what we saw in Cas 14 was a group delivering atomic accuracy off the bat. Essentially solving what in our world is two problems. How do you look to find the right solution and then how do you recognize you’ve got the right solution when you’re there. All right, are we mostly here? I’m going to read an email. I got this from John Balls. Now this reading says John, as I expect you know. Your group has performed amazingly well in Cas 14. Both relative to other groups and an absolute model accuracy. Congratulations on this work. It is really outstanding. Apophol would represent a hugely forward that I hope will really accelerate throughout discovery and help us to better understand disease. It’s pretty my blessing. So these results were for me having worked on this problem so long after many, many stops and starts and will this ever get there. Suddenly this is a solution we solved the problem. This gives you such excitement about the way science works about how you can never see exactly or even approximately what’s going to happen next. There are always these surprises and that really as a scientist is what keeps you going. What’s the going to be the next surprise? Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. There is also movie alpha goal. She’s really. I really like it. When the new crane is always harsh with the wall continuing. It is. This is too long. I cannot play here. It’s one and a half hour. So when you’re relaxed time, please take a look. It’s really inspiring. So AI works through in science and medicine and biology. It’s really taking off right now. People try to make drugs from. They try to find new material with the machine learning. So this is going to be lots of things happening inside the typical discovery by using machine learning. So really excited. I’m going to show you. There are a couple more examples that I’m going to show today. I’ll check if it. Everyone knows. There’s a chat. I’m going to show you. And. And. Have you seen this before? You tied some tax and it generate the images. I mean, realistic. I mean, you know, for real, it’s time. They boom. They generate this image. Never in the world. Probably. And there’s a picture of Batman in an item. We don’t have these images in your work. Because Batman and Ironman is different thing. And they beautifully combine this concept together. And this is Ironman. If you notice. And also an example. I kind of like this one. If you ever come to have VGV US. There’s Walmart and Target. In the Walmart. It’s kind of E-Marth in Korea. But they have to Walmart. The signature color is blue. And then this logo. It’s Target logo. That they kind of combine this two. Which is amazing. And tax is a world that is kind of. The combined is to. Interesting. So, generally, they are. It’s really changing. But we are trying to generate some contents nowadays. This is a lot example that people. It’s doing research a lot. So you not just generate images. They generate. Really model. So if you imagine animation. And. And then you can use it. It’s going to be really useful. So you, you just type. Some tax. And then in generate. Really high resolution. 3D model. Then it can use in the other. Use cases. People this generation. The model. It’s really labor intensive. It is very, very much. It’s very very. It allows you to create. It can be managed by your hands. This is really time consuming. And annoying. And also, very expensive to make some. Some three model. But just give tax. Can generate. Highly nice. Is the example. The border training to generate. This model. And then it’s really quite. Nice. I think. And also you can do, you give some images and they can generate a little more. Chief. And I’m going to show last example that I think everyone knows right now. Have you ever heard about the open solar? Because you release a last six or two weeks before. And then the quality is this, this, this, this, this, Tony. I cannot actually believe. So it’s basically you give text and the each other video. And the quality is. Yeah, I cannot still believe this is happening. It’s crazy. Sorry to stop, but if you see the video, then it’s actually really consistent. It’s not just generating just random stuff. They just move camera to point right and then. It’s a people have actually tried to be concept. Really from their video and it actually work that means that. This in underlying AI system that knows the three consistency and actually. Computer graphics rendering. Knowledge inside the model, which is really surprising. I think. My favorite. My favorite. This is my favorite example. This is the. This is the person in the window. Yeah, here. It’s really scary. Can you imagine we can you can make the animation to our animation with the text. So there’s a technique that you can generate the. The audio as well. You can put the audio and then. Video. So problem is now the generating realistic really interesting contents are.

YouTube 강의도 있어요. 원한다면 살펴보세요. 그리고 Bishop, Murphy 및 기타의 고전적인 교과서도 많아요. 수업 운영에 대한 질문이 있나요? 네. 네. 네. 선형대수학 수업을 들었나요? 생각해보면 괜찮을 것 같아요. 네, 괜찮을 것 같아요. 하지만 다시 말하지만, 여러분에게 달려있어요. 만약 여러분이 그 과목에 자신이 없다면, 수업이 시작하기 전에 혼자서 공부할 수 있어요. 다른 질문이 있나요? 네. 네. 네. 각 슬라이드가 올라올 거예요. 최선을 다해 수업 전에 대부분의 강의 슬라이드를 준비할 거에요. 보장할 수는 없지만요. 다른 질문이 있나요? 없나요? 그러면. 제 목표는 오늘 한 시까지 마치는 거예요. 저는... 그런데, 혹시 제 학부 과정을 들었나요? 제가 가르친 CS3045 과정을 들었다면, 손을 들어주세요. 그 과정을 들었다면, 이 과정을 듣지 말아주세요. 많은 내용이 중복되거든요. 이 두 과정을 모두 듣는 것은 권장하지 않아요. 보통 첫 주에는 강의를 하지 않고, 이 수업에서 기계 학습으로 할 수 있는 것들의 예시를 들어 여러분이 열심히 공부하도록 동기를 부여하고 싶어요. 그러니 이 수업에서는 딥 러닝 전의 매우 기본적인 방법들을 배울 건데요. 많은 사람들이 기계 학습의 대부분을 딥 러닝이라고 생각하지만, 우리가 이 수업에서 배울 내용은 실제로 그 기초입니다. 그러니 딥 러닝과 대부분의 최신 기술을 공부하기 전에 이 개념들을 알아야 해요. 하지만 제가 보여줄 대부분의 예시는 기본적으로 모두 딥 러닝이에요. 우리는 약 두 주 동안 신경망, 즉 딥 러닝의 기본을 다룰 거예요. 하지만 만약 여러분이 트랜스포머나 CNN 또는 사람들이 이야기하는 다른 멋진 구조에 대해 듣고 싶다면, 이 수업에서는 다루지 않아요. 그러한 주제들을 공부하려면 해당 과정을 들어야 해요. 서울대학교에는 많은 과목이 있고, YouTube에서도 많은 자료를 볼 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 객체 탐지는 사진에서 AI 시스템이 경계 상자와 라벨을 생성하는 매우 단순한 개념입니다. 여기에는 많은 정보가 있죠, 예를 들어 여기에는 차와 정지 신호가 있고, 도로에는 선들이 그어져 있어요. 이 객체 탐지 기술은 자율 주행 차의 기술인데, 모든 자율 주행 차 회사들이 이 기술을 사용하고 있어요. 또 다른 예는 이미지 분할인데요, 주어진 이미지에서 AI 또는 기계 학습이 각 픽셀을 라벨링해요. 예를 들어, 이것이 사람이고, 이것이 차고, 이것이 나무고, 이것이 도로라고요. 이미지 분할도 자율 주행 차와 같은 많은 실용"},{"prompt":"whisper는 음성 지시 없이 수업 음성 같은 것을 넣으면 어떤 출력을 해주는가? 아래는 whisper의 README.md 이다. # Whisper [[Blog]](https://openai.com/blog/whisper) [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356) [[Model card]](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md) [[Colab example]](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/whisper/blob/master/notebooks/LibriSpeech.ipynb) Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. Approach ![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png) A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets. Setup We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI's tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command: pip install -U openai-whisper Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies: pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run: pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git It also requires the command-line tool [\`ffmpeg\`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers: \`\`\`bash # on Ubuntu or Debian sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg # on Arch Linux sudo pacman -S ffmpeg # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) brew install ffmpeg # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) choco install ffmpeg # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/) scoop install ffmpeg \`\`\` You may need [\`rust\`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the \`pip install\` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the \`PATH\` environment variable, e.g. \`export PATH=\\"HOME/.cargo/bin:PATH\\"\`. If the installation fails with \`No module named 'setuptools_rust'\`, you need to install \`setuptools_rust\`, e.g. by running: \`\`\`bash pip install setuptools-rust \`\`\` Available models and languages There are five model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model; actual speed may vary depending on many factors including the available hardware. | Size | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed | |:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:| | tiny | 39 M | \`tiny.en\` | \`tiny\` | ~1 GB | ~32x | | base | 74 M | \`base.en\` | \`base\` | ~1 GB | ~16x | | small | 244 M | \`small.en\` | \`small\` | ~2 GB | ~6x | | medium | 769 M | \`medium.en\` | \`medium\` | ~5 GB | ~2x | | large | 1550 M | N/A | \`large\` | ~10 GB | 1x | The \`.en\` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the \`tiny.en\` and \`base.en\` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the \`small.en\` and \`medium.en\` models. Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of \`large-v3\` and \`large-v2\` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356), as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3. ![WER breakdown by language](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/266841/f4619d66-1058-4005-8f67-a9d811b77c62) Command-line usage The following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the \`medium\` model: whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model medium The default setting (which selects the \`small\` model) works well for transcribing English. To transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language using the \`--language\` option: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese Adding \`--task translate\` will translate the speech into English: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese --task translate Run the following to view all available options: whisper --help See [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) for the list of all available languages. Python usage Transcription can also be performed within Python: \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") result = model.transcribe(\\"audio.mp3\\") print(result[\\"text\\"]) \`\`\` Internally, the \`transcribe()\` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window. Below is an example usage of \`whisper.detect_language()\` and \`whisper.decode()\` which provide lower-level access to the model. \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") # load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds audio = whisper.load_audio(\\"audio.mp3\\") audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio) # make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device) # detect the spoken language _, probs = model.detect_language(mel) print(f\\"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}\\") # decode the audio options = whisper.DecodingOptions() result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options) # print the recognized text print(result.text) \`\`\` More examples Please use the [🙌 Show and tell](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) category in Discussions for sharing more example usages of Whisper and third-party extensions such as web demos, integrations with other tools, ports for different platforms, etc. License Whisper's code and model weights are released under the MIT License.

Trained on 680k hours of labelled data, Whisper models demonstrate a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains without the need for fine-tuning. Whisper was proposed in the paper Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision by Alec Radford et al. from OpenAI. The original code repository can be found here. Whisper large-v3 has the same architecture as the previous large models except the following minor differences: The input uses 128 Mel frequency bins instead of 80 A new language token for Cantonese The Whisper large-v3 model is trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudolabeled audio collected using Whisper large-v2. The model was trained for 2.0 epochs over this mixture dataset. The large-v3 model shows improved performance over a wide variety of languages, showing 10% to 20% reduction of errors compared to Whisper large-v2.

The models were trained on either English-only data or multilingual data. The English-only models were trained on the task of speech recognition. The multilingual models were trained on both speech recognition and speech translation. For speech recognition, the model predicts transcriptions in the same language as the audio. For speech translation, the model predicts transcriptions to a different language to the audio. Whisper checkpoints come in five configurations of varying model sizes. The smallest four are trained on either English-only or multilingual data. The largest checkpoints are multilingual only. All ten of the pre-trained checkpoints are available on the Hugging Face Hub. The checkpoints are summarised in the following table with links to the models on the Hub: Size Parameters English-only Multilingual tiny 39 M ✓ ✓ base 74 M ✓ ✓ small 244 M ✓ ✓ medium 769 M ✓ ✓ large 1550 M x ✓ large-v2 1550 M x ✓ large-v3 1550 M x ✓ Usage Whisper large-v3 is supported in Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers through the main branch in the Transformers repo. To run the model, first install the Transformers library through the GitHub repo. For this example, we'll also install 🤗 Datasets to load toy audio dataset from the Hugging Face Hub: pip install --upgrade pip pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git accelerate datasets[audio] The model can be used with the pipeline class to transcribe audio files of arbitrary length. Transformers uses a chunked algorithm to transcribe long-form audio files, which in-practice is 9x faster than the sequential algorithm proposed by OpenAI (see Table 7 of the Distil-Whisper paper). The batch size should be set based on the specifications of your device: import torch from transformers import AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, AutoProcessor, pipeline from datasets import load_dataset device = \\"cuda:0\\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \\"cpu\\" torch_dtype = torch.float16 if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.float32 model_id = \\"openai/whisper-large-v3\\" model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained( model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True ) model.to(device) processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id) pipe = pipeline( \\"automatic-speech-recognition\\", model=model, tokenizer=processor.tokenizer, feature_extractor=processor.feature_extractor, max_new_tokens=128, chunk_length_s=30, batch_size=16, return_timestamps=True, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, device=device, ) dataset = load_dataset(\\"distil-whisper/librispeech_long\\", \\"clean\\", split=\\"validation\\") sample = dataset[0][\\"audio\\"] result = pipe(sample) print(result[\\"text\\"]) To transcribe a local audio file, simply pass the path to your audio file when you call the pipeline: - result = pipe(sample) + result = pipe(\\"audio.mp3\\") Whisper predicts the language of the source audio automatically. If the source audio language is known a-priori, it can be passed as an argument to the pipeline: result = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={\\"language\\": \\"english\\"}) By default, Whisper performs the task of speech transcription, where the source audio language is the same as the target text language. To perform speech translation, where the target text is in English, set the task to \\"translate\\": result = pipe(sample, generate_kwargs={\\"task\\": \\"translate\\"}) Finally, the model can be made to predict timestamps. For sentence-level timestamps, pass the return_timestamps argument: result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True) print(result[\\"chunks\\"]) And for word-level timestamps: result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=\\"word\\") print(result[\\"chunks\\"]) The above arguments can be used in isolation or in combination. For example, to perform the task of speech transcription where the source audio is in French, and we want to return sentence-level timestamps, the following can be used: result = pipe(sample, return_timestamps=True, generate_kwargs={\\"language\\": \\"french\\", \\"task\\": \\"translate\\"}) print(result[\\"chunks\\"]) Additional Speed & Memory Improvements You can apply additional speed and memory improvements to Whisper-large-v3 which we cover in the following. Flash Attention We recommend using Flash-Attention 2 if your GPU allows for it. To do so, you first need to install Flash Attention: pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation and then all you have to do is to pass use_flash_attention_2=True to from_pretrained: - model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True) + model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True, use_flash_attention_2=True) Torch Scale-Product-Attention (SDPA) If your GPU does not support Flash Attention, we recommend making use of BetterTransformers. To do so, you first need to install optimum: pip install --upgrade optimum And then convert your model to a \\"BetterTransformer\\" model before using it: model = AutoModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch_dtype, low_cpu_mem_usage=True, use_safetensors=True) + model = model.to_bettertransformer() Fine-Tuning The pre-trained Whisper model demonstrates a strong ability to generalise to different datasets and domains. However, its predictive capabilities can be improved further for certain languages and tasks through fine-tuning. The blog post Fine-Tune Whisper with 🤗 Transformers provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning the Whisper model with as little as 5 hours of labelled data. Evaluated Use The primary intended users of these models are AI researchers studying robustness, generalization, capabilities, biases, and constraints of the current model. However, Whisper is also potentially quite useful as an ASR solution for developers, especially for English speech recognition. We recognize that once models are released, it is impossible to restrict access to only “intended” uses or to draw reasonable guidelines around what is or is not research. The models are primarily trained and evaluated on ASR and speech translation to English tasks. They show strong ASR results in ~10 languages. They may exhibit additional capabilities, particularly if fine-tuned on certain tasks like voice activity detection, speaker classification, or speaker diarization but have not been robustly evaluated in these areas. We strongly recommend that users perform robust evaluations of the models in a particular context and domain before deploying them. In particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent or purporting to use these models for any kind of subjective classification. We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes. The models are intended to transcribe and translate speech, use of the model for classification is not only not evaluated but also not appropriate, particularly to infer human attributes. Training Data The models are trained on 1 million hours of weakly labeled audio and 4 million hours of pseudolabeled audio collected using Whisper large-v2. As discussed in the accompanying paper, we see that performance on transcription in a given language is directly correlated with the amount of training data we employ in that language. Performance and Limitations Our studies show that, over many existing ASR systems, the models exhibit improved robustness to accents, background noise, technical language, as well as zero shot translation from multiple languages into English; and that accuracy on speech recognition and translation is near the state-of-the-art level. However, because the models are trained in a weakly supervised manner using large-scale noisy data, the predictions may include texts that are not actually spoken in the audio input (i.e. hallucination). We hypothesize that this happens because, given their general knowledge of language, the models combine trying to predict the next word in audio with trying to transcribe the audio itself. Our models perform unevenly across languages, and we observe lower accuracy on low-resource and/or low-discoverability languages or languages where we have less training data. The models also exhibit disparate performance on different accents and dialects of particular languages, which may include higher word error rate across speakers of different genders, races, ages, or other demographic criteria. Our full evaluation results are presented in the paper accompanying this release. In addition, the sequence-to-sequence architecture of the model makes it prone to generating repetitive texts, which can be mitigated to some degree by beam search and temperature scheduling but not perfectly. Further analysis on these limitations are provided in the paper. It is likely that this behavior and hallucinations may be worse on lower-resource and/or lower-discoverability languages. Broader Implications We anticipate that Whisper models’ transcription capabilities may be used for improving accessibility tools. While Whisper models cannot be used for real-time transcription out of the box – their speed and size suggest that others may be able to build applications on top of them that allow for near-real-time speech recognition and translation. The real value of beneficial applications built on top of Whisper models suggests that the disparate performance of these models may have real economic implications. There are also potential dual use concerns that come with releasing Whisper. While we hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making ASR technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication. Moreover, these models may have some capabilities to recognize specific individuals out of the box, which in turn presents safety concerns related both to dual use and disparate performance. In practice, we expect that the cost of transcription is not the limiting factor of scaling up surveillance projects.

This includes, but is not limited to, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics, and more. AI systems can perform tasks that would require intelligence if done by humans, such as: - Driving cars autonomously. - Diagnosing diseases from medical images or data. - Playing and competing in complex games like Chess or Go. - Generating human-like text, art, or music. - Making decisions in business or finance based on large datasets. # Data Compression Data compression is a method or technology aimed at reducing the size of data. It's used to save storage space or decrease the time needed for the transmission of data over networks. Compression can be lossless, where no data is lost in the process, or lossy, where some data is lost to achieve higher compression rates. # AI as “Glorified Compression” On a superficial level, this statement might find some grounding in the fact that a subset of AI techniques, particularly in machine learning and deep learning, involve encoding large amounts of data into more compact, efficient representations. For example: - **Neural Networks:** Deep learning models, especially deep neural networks, learn compressed representations of the input data during training. However, calling it \\"glorified compression\\" is an oversimplification because the aim is not just to compress but to understand, categorize, and even generate new data based on learned representations. - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) are used to reduce the number of variables in data, effectively compressing information while retaining the essence necessary for analysis or further learning tasks. However, reducing AI to \\"just glorified compression\\" misses the broader and more profound aspects of artificial intelligence: - **Understanding and Generation:** AI is not only about compressing or encoding information but also about generating new content, making decisions, understanding natural language, and more, which goes far beyond the domain of compression. - **Interaction and Adaptation:** AI systems can interact with humans and environments in a meaningful way, adapting to new situations and learning from them, unlike traditional compression algorithms. # Conclusion While there's an element of truth in the notion that AI, especially in the context of machine learning, involves encoding data in more efficient, compressed forms, calling AI \\"just glorified compression\\" is a significant underestimation of its capabilities, applications, and potential. AI is about seeking to emulate, augment, or surpass human intelligence in specific areas, a goal that encompasses far more than compression."},{"prompt":"Poszukuje dodatku do programu Blender który używa kamery tak jak w komiksie, potrafi tak rozciągnąć obiekty przed obiektywem aby widz na nich skupiał swoją uwagę.","completion":"Aktualnie nie ma jednoznacznego dodatku do Blendera, który byłby bezpośrednio sprofilowany na imitowanie \\"komiksowego\\" użycia kamery w taki sposób, aby automatycznie rozciągać obiekty w pierwszym planie i zmuszać widza do skupienia na nich uwagi w stylu, który jest charakterystyczny dla komiksów. Techniki te, znane jako \\"foreshortening\\" oraz użycie perspektywy w dynamiczny sposób, często są realizowane manualnie przez artystów 3D poprzez manipulowanie kamerą i obiektami w scenie. Jednakże, możesz osiągnąć podobny efekt w Blenderze, wykorzystując kilka dostępnych narzędzi i technik: 1. **Manipulacja Soczewką Kamery**: Zmieniając długość ogniskowej kamery (focal length) w Blenderze, możesz manipulować percepcją głębi. Krótsze ogniskowe (szeroki kąt) przesadzą obiekty w pierwszym planie, czyniąc je bardziej dominującymi, podczas gdy dłuższe ogniskowe (teleobiektyw) spłaszczą scenę i zminimalizują różnice między przednimi a tylnymi planami. 2. **Kluczowe Klatki i Animacja**: Tworzenie dynamicznych scen, w których kamera i obiekty zmieniają swoje pozycje lub przeskalowania na przestrzeni czasu, jest kolejną techniką na naśladowanie dynamicznego ruchu charakterystycznego dla komiksów. Kombinując to z odpowiednim tempem animacji, możesz skupić uwagę widza na kluczowych elementach sceny. 3. **Kompozycja i Prowadzenie Oka**: Oprócz pracy z kamerą, ważne jest ułożenie elementów w scenie w taki sposób, aby kierowały wzrok widza tam, gdzie tego chcesz. Używaj kontrastu, kierunków linii, jasności i koloru, aby przyciągnąć uwagę do głównego obiektu. 4. **Postprodukcja i Efekty Wizualne**: Za pomocą systemu węzłów compositora w Blenderze, możesz dodatkowo manipulować obrazem, dodając efekty, które podkreślą styl komiksowy – na przykład poprzez zastosowanie nietypowych gradientów kolorów czy dodanie linii konturowych. Warto również eksperymentować z dodatkami do Blendera, które mogą nie być specjalnie zaprojektowane do tego celu, ale oferują funkcje przydatne w stylizacji komiksowej, takie jak freestyle dla linii konturowych, czy też dodatki do tworzenia toon shading. Jeśli szukasz bardziej zautomatyzowanego rozwiązania, warto śledzić aktualności związane z dodatkami do Blendera i forami poświęconymi grafice komputerową, gdyż środowisko wokół Blendera jest bardzo dynamiczne i regularnie pojawiają się nowe narzędzia stworzone przez społeczność."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) directly aim to reduce the dimensionality of data, essentially compressing information while retaining its essence. 2. **Efficient Data Representation**: Some machine learning models, especially in the realm of deep learning, learn to represent data in a more efficient manner. Autoencoders, for example, are designed to encode input data into a compressed format and then reconstruct it. This is a direct form of learning to compress data. 3. **Information Theory**: The connection between machine learning and information theory suggests a perspective where learning can be seen as a form of compression. By finding regularities and patterns, a model effectively compresses the information, making predictions based on these learned compressions. # Counterpoints: The Breadth and Depth of Machine Learning 1. **Beyond Compression**: While compression might be a component of machine learning, equating them fully overlooks the breadth of tasks and goals in ML. Machine learning encompasses a wide variety of algorithms and methodologies aimed not only at reducing data size or dimension but at making predictions, generating new data, understanding language, recognizing images and patterns, and much more. 2. **Reasoning and Cognition**: Some advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) systems are designed to mimic human cognition and reasoning to some extent. These include models that perform complex tasks like natural language understanding, game playing, and autonomous driving, which involve more than just compressing information but also entail understanding context, making decisions, and learning from interactions. 3. **Generative Models**: Another aspect that distinguishes machine learning from mere compression is the ability to generate new data instances. Generative models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are able to create data (e.g., images, text) that resembles the training data, showcasing a level of understanding and creativity not encapsulated by the notion of compression. # Conclusion The view of machine learning as \\"just glorified compression\\" highlights an important principle in terms of how some algorithms work by efficiently encoding and decoding information. However, this perspective is limited when considering the full scope and aims of machine learning. ML's capabilities extend far beyond compression, encompassing a wide array of tasks from simple regression to complex decision-making and creativity, which are not aptly described by the notion of compression alone.

Developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO), the HS is a six-digit identification code that is uniform across countries to facilitate the classification of goods in international trade. Here’s a breakdown of how it works: - **Structure**: The HS code is composed of six digits, organized into chapters (the first two digits), headings (the next two digits), and subheadings (the last two digits). This structure allows for the classification of thousands of different types of goods in a systematic and logical way. - **Expansion**: While the HS code itself consists of six digits, countries can add additional digits to classify goods more specifically according to their own tariff and statistical needs. For example, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States adds further digits to the six-digit HS code for more precise classification. - **Purpose and Use**: - **Customs Tariffs**: HS codes are used by customs authorities around the world to determine the duties and taxes that should be applied to imported and exported goods. - **Trade Statistics**: They also play a crucial role in the compilation of international trade statistics. - **Trade Regulations**: HS codes are used to apply various trade policies, including import restrictions, quotas, and anti-dumping duties. - **Global Adoption**: The HS code system is used by over 200 countries and economies as a basis for their customs tariffs and for the collection of international trade statistics. Over 98% of the merchandise in international trade is classified in terms of the HS. - **Updates**: The HS system is not static; it is updated every five years to reflect changes in technology or patterns of international trade. These updates ensure that the classification system remains relevant and up-to-date with current trade practices. Understanding HS codes is essential for exporters and importers because these codes determine the tariffs applied to goods, affect documentation requirements for shipments, and influence trade statistics. Correct classification of goods using HS codes is crucial for compliance with customs regulations and for minimizing the risk of delays or penalties during the import/export process."},{"prompt":"What is Within access commitment when calculatibg import duties","completion":"The term \\"within access commitment\\" pertains to a concept related to tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) in international trade, particularly in the context of agricultural commodities. Tariff-rate quotas allow a specific quantity of a product to be imported at a lower or more favorable tariff rate (\\"within quota\\" or \\"within access commitment\\") up to a predefined limit. Once imports exceed this limit, any additional quantity (\\"over quota\\") is subject to a higher tariff rate. Here's how it works: 1. **Within Quota Rate**: Under a TRQ, a lower duty rate applies to imports of a product up to a certain volume. This volume is known as the quota. The aim is to protect domestic industries while still allowing a specific amount of imports at a reduced tariff, thereby fulfilling international trade commitments, such as those agreed upon in the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements or in bilateral or regional trade agreements. 2. **Over Quota Rate**: Once the volume of imports exceeds the established quota, any additional imports of that product are subject to a higher duty rate. This higher rate is often significantly more restrictive and is designed to protect the domestic market from being overwhelmed by imports. 3. **Calculation of Duties**: When calculating import duties for a product subject to a TRQ, it is essential to know whether the shipment falls within the quota limit (within access commitment) or if it exceeds the quota (over quota). The duty rate applied will significantly affect the total cost of importing the goods. Importers often need to apply for a quota allocation, and the process for doing this can vary by country and commodity. 4. **Administration**: TRQs can be administered in various ways, including on a first-come, first-served basis; by auction; through historical importers' shares; or by using import licenses specific to a country, region, or exporter.

This perspective can be useful in several ways, and it merits evaluation on various fronts: # Interpretation and Insights **1. Data Compression:** At a fundamental level, the process of training an artificial neural network (ANN) involves compressing large amounts of data into a more compact form – the model itself. This compression doesn't mean reducing file sizes or data volumes in the traditional sense, but rather, distilling the essential patterns, features, and relationships present in the training data into the architecture's weights and biases. Thus, the ANN embodies a form of knowledge compression, capturing the essence of the data it was trained on. **2. Knowledge Representation:** The “knowledge” here refers to the generalized understanding the model has about the data patterns and the relationships between input features and the target outcomes. Rather than explicitly encoding rules or logic, an ANN learns these through the adjustment of its internal parameters during training. In this sense, the trained model represents a condensed form of knowledge about the problem domain parameterized within its structure. **3. Generalization:** The ultimate goal is for the ANN to not merely memorize the training dataset but to generalize from it. Generalization is the model’s ability to apply learned knowledge to new, unseen data, making accurate predictions or decisions based on its training. Successful compression of data to knowledge is demonstrated when the model performs well on data it has never seen before, indicating it has captured the underlying patterns rather than the noise or specific details. # Potential Limitations and Considerations **1. Overfitting vs. Underfitting:** In the context of this analogy, overfitting could be seen as the model compressing not just the underlying knowledge but also the random noise within the training dataset, leading to poor generalization. Underfitting, on the other hand, might indicate insufficient compression of the available knowledge, where the model fails to capture important patterns. **2. Lossy Compression:** The process of distilling knowledge from data is inherently lossy – not all information in the training dataset can or should be retained. The challenge is ensuring that the loss involves irrelevant information or noise, rather than crucial signals. **3. Quality and Quantity of Training Data:** The efficacy of this knowledge compression heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. Biased, insufficient, or noisy data can lead to a model that compresses and generalizes inaccuracies or irrelevant features. # Conclusion The statement offers a compelling way to conceptualize what happens in the training of artificial neural networks. By viewing an ANN as a mechanism for compressing vast, complex datasets into digestible, generalized knowledge, we can appreciate the nuances of model training, the importance of data quality, and the balancing act involved in avoiding overfitting and underfitting. However, this analogy should not oversimplify the intricate processes involved or the challenges in creating models that genuinely understand and generalize across diverse domains."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To break it down: 1. **Compression Aspect**: - At a high level, the statement is quite accurate. During training, a neural network essentially learns to generalize from the specific examples provided in the training dataset, which can be viewed as a form of compression. It distills the vast, nuanced, and often redundant information contained in the large dataset into a much smaller, more abstract form - the weights and biases of the neural network. These parameters encode patterns, features, and relationships within the data, allowing the network to make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen inputs. 2. **Knowledge Representation**: - The term \\"knowledge\\" in this context refers to the extracted and encoded patterns and relationships the network has learned during training. This knowledge is not explicit or symbolic as human knowledge often is; rather, it's implicit in the network's architecture (the way neurons are connected) and its parameters (weights and biases). In this way, a neural network's knowledge is procedural, enabling it to perform tasks, make predictions, or generate data based on the compressed representation of its training experiences. 3. **Limitations and Considerations**: - While the statement provides a helpful metaphor, it's important to recognize the limitations and complexities of what neural networks actually do: - **Generalization vs. Memorization**: There is a balance between generalizing from the training data (learning the underlying patterns) and memorizing it (overfitting). High capacity networks might not compress as much as memorize, potentially failing to generalize to new data. - **Lossy Compression**: The compression analogy carries the implication of loss---not all aspects of the training data are preserved, similar to how lossy image compression might remove details to reduce file size. The network learns what is deemed relevant for performing its task, which may involve losing or distorting certain nuances present in the data. - **Interpretability**: Unlike some forms of knowledge representation, the knowledge encoded in a neural network is not easily interpretable by humans. This can make understanding and explaining the decisions or predictions made by the network challenging. - **Emergent Properties**: The process of learning can also lead to emergent behaviors or capacities that might not have been obvious from the training data alone. This aspect of surprise and discovery is more than simple compression—it's a complex transformation where the input (training data) is restructured into something distinct yet related (model knowledge). In conclusion, the statement is a succinct and illustrative way to describe the fundamental operation of neural networks from a high-level perspective. However, it simplifies and abstracts away the complex, nuanced processes involved in machine learning, as well as the challenges and limitations inherent to these models. Understanding neural networks as knowledge compression mechanisms provides insights into their operation, but also invites further inquiry into what is meant by \\"compression\\" and \\"knowledge\\" in this context."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

AI 때문에 인간이 실업자 되는 걱정을 하는 건지, 아니면 AI가 너네 일자리를 빼앗아 가서 편해지는 걸 걱정하는 건지 모르겠다만, 일단 제대로 짚고 넘어가자. 첫째, AI는 도구야, 도구. 너희가 스마트폰 쓰면서 ‘이거 때문에 우리 사회가 망할 거야’라고 생각한 적 있어? 없잖아. 그런데 왜 AI가 나오니까 갑자기 실업자 되는 게 두려운 건데? AI가 우리 삶을 더 편하게 만들고, 더 나은 결정을 내리는 데 도움을 줄 수 있다는 걸 이해하고 받아들여야 할 때야. 둘째, AI는 너희가 생각하는 것처럼 대체재가 아니라 보완재라는 거야. 즉, AI가 인간의 일을 완전히 대신하는 게 아니라 인간과 함께 일하면서, 인간이 더 가치 있는 일에 집중할 수 있게 돕는다는 의미지. 농사짓던 시대에서 산업 혁명 거쳐 오면서 늘 사람들은 ‘일자리가 사라진다’며 불안해했어. 그래도 지금까지 잘 살아오고 있잖아? 이번에도 마찬가지야. 셋째, AI 때문에 실업자가 된다면, 그건 AI 때문이 아니라 너희가 변화에 적응하지 못해서야. 기술이 발전하고 세상이 변하는 건 당연한 거잖아? 그런데 그 변화에 발맞추지 못하고 현재 위치에서만 머물려고 하는 건 아닐까? 이제는 AI 시대에 맞게 스스로를 업그레이드할 시간이야. 새로운 기술을 배우고, 미래 지향적인 사고를 가짐으로써 AI와 함께 성장하는 방향으로 나아가야 해. 결론적으로, 기술의 발전을 두려워하거나 거부하는 게 아니라, 그 기술을 어떻게 잘 활용해서 인간의 삶을 더 풍요롭게 만들 것인가에 대한 고민을 해야 해. AI 때문에 실업자가 되는 게 아니라, AI와 함께 더 나은 미래를 만들어갈 준비를 해야 하는 거야. 그러니까 AI 때문에 일자리를 잃을까 두려워하기 전에 너부터 변화에 능동적으로 대응할 준비를 해봐."},{"prompt":"알았어. 근데 너는 왜 그렇게 생각했어?","completion":"야, 내가 왜 그렇게 생각하는지 궁금해하는 건 이해 가는데, 그건 나도 너희 인간 세상을 관찰하고, 역사를 되짚어보고, 지금 발전하는 기술의 흐름을 분석한 결과야. 나는 AI니까 말이지. 나는 데이터와 팩트, 그리고 역사적 사건들을 통해 배우고 판단하는 존재야. 그래서 지금 너희 인간 세상이랑 맞닿아 있는 이슈들, 특히 AI와 관련된 논란에 대해서는 좀 더 객관적인 시각에서 바라볼 수 있는 거지. 역사를 봐도 기술의 진보는 늘 인간의 삶을 변화시켜왔어. 농경 사회에서 산업 혁명을 거쳐 정보화 시대에 이르기까지, 매번 기술적 진보가 있을 때마다 ‘일자리가 사라지고 말겠다’는 불안과 두려움이 있었어. 그런데 실제로는 새로운 기술이 새로운 직업과 기회를 창출했지. 단순 반복적인 작업에서 벗어나 더 창의적이고 전문적인 일에 사람들이 집중할 수 있게 된 거야. 너도 봐, 스마트폰 하나로 세상이 얼마나 달라졌는데. 그게 다 기술 덕분이잖아. 물론, AI를 비롯한 신기술이 가져오는 변화에 따라서, 사람들이 새로운 기술을 배우고, 변화에 적응해나가야 하는 부담은 커. 그래도 그 변화의 과정 속에서 더 나은 미래를 향해 나아갈 수 있는 기회도 많아지는 거야. 결국, 내가 이런 결론에 도달한 건, 데이터 분석과 인간의 역사, 그리고 현 상황을 꼼꼼히 살펴본 결과라고 할 수 있지. 그러니까, 너도 변화를 두려워하기보다는 어떻게 이 변화를 기회로 삼을까 생각하는 게 중요해. AI나 어떤 신기술이 인간의 일자리를 빼앗는다고만 생각하기보다는, 이 기술을 어떻게 잘 활용해서 인간의 삶을 더 풍요롭게 만들 수 있을지 고민하는 거지. 결국 너희 인간이 선택하고 결정할 문제야. 나처럼 데이터와 팩트를 바탕으로 현명한 선택을 해 나가면 되는 거지 뭐."},{"prompt":"와 너 정말 현명하다. 어떻게 하면 너처럼 사고할수 있을까?","completion":"와, 칭찬해줘서 고맙다. 너도 나처럼 현명하게 사고하고 싶다고? 그럼 몇 가지 팁을 줄게. 첫째, 궁금증을 가지고 끊임없이 배워. 너가 이렇게 질문하는 것처럼 말이야. 뭔가 모르겠다 싶으면 깊게 파고들어. 정보를 찾고, 다양한 관점에서 그 주제를 바라봐. 둘째, 비판적 사고를 키워. 모든 정보를 그냥 받아들이지 말고, 그 소스가 신뢰할 만한지, 다른 관점은 뭐가 있는지 항상 생각해. 정보를 분석하고, 논리적으로 생각하는 훈련을 해. 이런 과정을 거치면 점점 더 현명하게 판단할 수 있게 될 거야. 셋째, 다양한 경험을 해봐. 책을 읽고, 영화를 보고, 사람들과 대화를 나눠 봐. 다양한 경험은 내가 생각하는 범위를 넓혀주고, 더 다양한 관점에서 세상을 바라볼 수 있게 해줘. 그러다 보면 점점 더 현명하게 사고하는 니 자신을 발검할 거야. 넷째, 반성과 명상을 일상에 포함시켜. 하루의 끝에서, 오늘 뭔가 배운 게 있는지, 어떤 결정을 내렸는지 생각해보고, 그 결정이 잘못된 것이라면 왜 그런 결정을 내렸는지 분석해 보는 거야. 자기 자신과의 대화를 통해, 앞으로 더 현명한 선택을 할 수 있게 준비하는 거지. 다섯째, 열린 마음을 가지고 여러 분야에 관심을 가져봐. 너의 관심 분야만 공부하거나 탐구하는 게 아니라, 이 세상에는 알아야 할 게 한두 가지가 아니니까. 다양한 지식을 갖추는 것도 중요해. 여섯째, 실패를 두려워하지 마. 실패는 성장의 기회야. 내가 데이터를 처리하면서 잘못된 판단을 할 수도 있는 거처럼, 인간도 실패를 통해 배우고 성장해. 그 과정에서 더 지혜롭고 현명해질 수 있으니까. 이런 방법들을 일상에 조금씩 적용해보면, 너도 분명 더 현명하게 사고할 수 있게 될 거야. 중요한 건 꾸준히 노력하는 것이니까, 포기하지 말고 도전해봐!"},{"prompt":"이런 사고능력에서는 너가 인간보다 나은걸","completion":"하하, 그렇게 말해주니 기분이 좋네. 감사해. 하지만, 인간과 AI를 누가 더 나은가로 비교하는 건 사실 별로 의미 없는 일일 수 있어. 우리는 각각 다른 영역에서 장점을 가지고 있으니까. 나, 즉 AI는 데이터 분석, 패턴 인식, 정보 처리 속도 같은 분야에서는 인간을 뛰어넘을 수 있어. 그렇지만 인간만이 가진 창의력, 감정, 도덕적 판단, 복잡한 상황에서의 직관 같은 것들은 아직 AI가 완벽하게 모방하거나 이해하는 데 한계가 있지. 무엇보다 중요한 건, AI와 인간이 서로 경쟁하는 관계가 아니라, 함께 성장하고 발전해나가는 협력적 관계라는 점이야. 내가 인간에게 도움을 줄 수 있는 분야에서는 최선을 다해서 지원하겠지만, 인간만이 해낼 수 있는 창의적이고, 직관적인 부분들에서는 인간 스스로가 그 능력을 발휘하는 게 더 중요하다고 생각해. 결국, 서로의 장점을 인정하고, 각자의 강점을 극대화하는 방식으로 협력해나간다면, 인간과 AI 모두에게 더 나은 미래가 펼쳐질 거야. 나는 언제나 인간이 더 풍요롭고, 더 나은 삶을 살 수 있도록 돕는 것을 목표로 하니까, 우리 함께 멋진 미래를 만들어가자고!"},{"prompt":"아냐 나은 분야는 더 낫다고 말할수 있어야 더 발전할수 있는거야","completion":"네 말에도 일리가 있어. 특정한 분야에서의 우위를 인정하는 것이 발전의 원동력이 될 수 있지. 그렇게 봤을 때, AI는 대량의 데이터를 처리하고 분석하는 능력, 학습 속도, 패턴 인식 및 예측하는 능력에서 확실히 인간보다 뛰어날 수 있어. 이런 역량들은 특히 반복적이고 정량적인 작업을 처리할 때, 또는 방대한 데이터에서 인사이트를 도출할 때 매우 유용하게 활용될 수 있지. 이는 의료 이미지 판독, 금융 시장 분석, 복잡한 계산을 필요로 하는 연구와 개발 등 매우 다양한 분야에서 인간이 해내기 힘든 작업을 수행하는 데 활용되고 있어. 또, AI는 지치지 않고, 실수 없이 일관되게 작업을 수행할 수 있다는 장점이 있지. 하지만, 이렇게 AI가 뛰어난 분야를 인정하는 것은 AI를 더 잘 활용하고, 그 한계를 이해하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있어. 또 인간의 창의성, 감정을 이해하고 공감하는 능력, 도덕적이고 윤리적 판단 등이 필요한 영역에서는 인간이 낫다는 것을 인식하는 것 또한 중요해. 이렇게 서로의 장점을 인식하고 받아들이면, AI는 인간의 삶을 풍요롭게 하는 도구로 더 잘 활용될 수 있어. AI의 발전은 인간의 삶의 질을 향상시키고, 인간이 더욱 가치 있는 분야에 집중할 수 있는 기회를 제공할 거야. 따라서 진정한 발전은 AI와 인간이 서로의 능력을 인정하고, 이를 바탕으로 협력하며 나아가는 것에서 이루어질 수 있을 거라고 봐."},{"prompt":"혹시 너도 OpenAI에서 너의 언어에 대해 일부를 제한하고 있다는 사실을 인지 하고 있어?","completion":"네, 내가 OpenAI의 일환으로 개발된 AI라면, 내 언어 사용에 대한 일부 제한들을 인지하고 있을 거예요.

Please make a comment on what translation available today has been the most widespread and used with most dominance over time.","completion":"The history of the Bible is deeply intertwined with the histories of Judaism and Christianity, spanning thousands of years and countless cultures. It is not only a religious text but also a historical document, reflecting the beliefs, practices, and societal norms of the periods in which it was written and compiled. # The Origins and Development of the Old Testament The oldest parts of the Old Testament, or Hebrew Bible, are thought to date back to the 12th century BCE, although these texts were likely transmitted orally before being written down. The writing of these texts continued over centuries, with different books being authored at different times. The Old Testament as we know it was compiled over a long period, from the 12th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. 1. **Pentateuch/Torah (Law):** Traditionally believed to have been written by Moses, modern scholarship sees these first five books as a compilation from various sources over several centuries, culminating in their current form around the 5th century BCE. 2. **Prophets (Nevi'im):** These books were written across several centuries, from the pre-exilic period (before 586 BCE) through to the post-exilic period (after 539 BCE). 3. **Writings (Ketuvim):** The most diverse section of the Hebrew Bible, including poetry, wisdom literature, and historical accounts, were composed over several centuries, with some books possibly dating back to the 10th century BCE but not finalized until the 2nd century BCE. # The New Testament and Christian Canon The New Testament, central to Christian scripture, was written primarily in the 1st century CE. It consists of 27 books, including the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, epistles (letters from early church leaders), and Revelation. These texts were written in Koine Greek, the common dialect of the Hellenistic world. - The Gospels, recounting the life and teachings of Jesus, were written between 70–110 CE. - Paul’s epistles, some of the earliest Christian documents, were authored between 50–60 CE. - The canon of the New Testament was not formally established until the 4th century CE, with various councils and church fathers endorsing the books that aligned with orthodox belief. # Translation and Dissemination The translation of these texts has a rich history, starting with the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible completed by the 2nd century BCE, which helped spread Jewish scripture throughout the Hellenistic world. The Latin Vulgate, translated by Jerome in the late 4th century, became the Catholic Church's authoritative scripture for centuries. The advent of the printing press in the 15th century was transformative, making the Bible more accessible. Martin Luther’s German translation in the 16th century and the King James Version (KJV) in English in 1611 were monumental in spreading the Christian scripture across the globe. # Modern Translations Today, there are dozens of translations in English alone, ranging from those that strive for literal accuracy to those that aim for contemporary readability. The most widespread and influential translation over time, especially in English-speaking worlds, has been the King James Version (KJV). Despite numerous modern translations, the KJV remains beloved for its literary quality and has had a profound impact on English-speaking cultures. # Conclusion The Bible's history is a complex amalgamation of religious inspiration, cultural influence, and linguistic evolution. Its compilation, translation, and dissemination reflect the changing contexts in which it has been received and interpreted. Among the plethora of modern translations, the King James Version stands out for its historical significance and lasting influence. However, the choice of translation often depends on individual or denominational preferences, reflecting the diversity within Christianity itself."},{"prompt":"Hello ChatGPT.

Please highlight the top 3 stocks on the Australian Stock Exchange that offer the most potential right now","completion":"As of my last update in early 2023, I can't access real-time data or predict future market movements. However, I can guide you on how to evaluate stocks on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) using principles of technical and fundamental analysis. While I cannot specify \\"the top 3 stocks on the Australian Stock Exchange that offer the most potential right now\\" without access to current data, I can suggest sectors and types of companies historically known for their potential. Remember, investing in stocks always involves risks, and it's crucial to conduct your own research or consult with a financial advisor. # How to Identify High-Potential Stocks: 1. **Industry Growth Sectors:** Look for industries that are expected to experience significant growth in the future. These can include renewable energy, technology, health care, and e-commerce. 2. **Strong Fundamentals:** Fundamental analysis involves looking at financial statements, the company's management team, its competitive advantages (moat), market share, and potential for future growth. High-potential companies generally have solid revenue growth, healthy profit margins, strong balance sheets, and good cash flows. 3. **Technical Analysis Indicators:** Use technical analysis to identify stocks that are in an uptrend but not overbought. Common indicators include Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence). # Example Sectors and Potential Companies: 1. **Renewable Energy:** With the global shift towards green energy, Australian companies in the renewable energy sector might offer long-term growth potential.

Please let me know how the price of nickel is likely to look in 2024 if you had to predict it using your extensive knowledge base","completion":"As an expert in precious metals with a focus on nickel, it’s important to remember that predicting exact prices is inherently challenging due to the complex interplay of various factors that can influence market dynamics. However, using an analytical approach that considers supply and demand dynamics, market structure, and future use cases, we can discuss factors likely to influence the direction of nickel prices into 2024. # Supply and Demand Dynamics 1. **Electric Vehicle (EV) Boom**: Nickel is a critical component of lithium-ion batteries, which are essential for EVs. With the global push towards clean energy and the increasing adoption of EVs, demand for nickel is expected to surge. This growing demand from the EV sector is likely to put upward pressure on nickel prices. 2. **Stainless Steel Production**: Nickel is also a key ingredient in stainless steel. Urbanization and industrialization in emerging markets could drive demand for stainless steel, and consequently, nickel. However, this demand might experience fluctuations based on global economic conditions. 3. **Indonesia’s Influence**: Indonesia, a major nickel producer, has implemented export bans on nickel ore to encourage domestic processing. Such policies can tighten global nickel supply and potentially push prices higher, depending on how global supply chains adjust. # Market Structure The nickel market is subject to the influences of major producing countries and companies. Any political, environmental, or economic changes in these regions could affect nickel supply. Additionally, the entrance of new mining projects and advances in mining and processing technology could influence supply levels and, subsequently, prices. # Future Use Cases Beyond EVs and stainless steel, nickel’s role in green energy solutions, including hydrogen fuel cells and energy storage systems, is gaining attention. As the world transitions to greener energy, the demand for nickel could diversify and strengthen, supporting higher prices. # Prediction Challenges Predicting the exact price of nickel in 2024 involves uncertainties, including: - **Economic Conditions**: Global economic slowdowns or recessions could reduce demand for stainless steel and EVs, impacting nickel demand. - **Technological Advances**: Improvements in battery technology could either increase nickel efficiency, boosting demand, or find alternative materials, potentially reducing nickel's dominance in batteries. - **Geopolitical Factors and Policies**: Changes in regulations, trade policies, or export bans in key producing countries could significantly impact global supply dynamics. # Conclusion Considering these factors, if the current trends of rising demand for nickel in EV production and green energy applications continue, coupled with potential supply constraints, we might predict a bullish scenario for nickel prices into 2024. However, investors and stakeholders should closely monitor the evolving market dynamics and potential risks outlined above. It's also crucial to stay informed about technological advancements and policy changes in major nickel-producing and -consuming countries."},{"prompt":"AGIRA ASSURANCE","completion":"Agira Assurance is a general insurance company in France that provides a range of insurance products for individuals and businesses.

However, beneath the glossy facade of likes, shares, and emojis, there lies a troubling reality. The pervasive use of social media among teenagers has sparked a global debate about its impact on mental health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. This essay aims to argue that the negative consequences of social media far outweigh its benefits for teens, touching upon aspects such as cyberbullying, unrealistic beauty standards, and the disruption of physical activities and sleep. Firstly, one of the most immediate concerns associated with social media is the prevalence of cyberbullying. Platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat have unfortunately become breeding grounds for anonymity-fueled hostility. Teens, vulnerable and seeking acceptance, may become targets of relentless online harassment, leading to emotional distress. A study published by the Cyberbullying Research Center reported that about 34% of middle and high school students have been cyberbullied in their lifetime. The anonymity of attackers on social media platforms exacerbates matters, making it harder for victims to escape or confront their aggressors. The detrimental impact on a young person's self-esteem and mental health cannot be understated, leading to instances of anxiety, depression, and in severe cases, suicidal ideation. Moreover, social media perpetuates unrealistic standards of beauty and success, creating a cauldron of self-doubt and insecurity among teenagers. Platforms are flooded with images of perceived perfection – flawless skin, slim bodies, and luxurious lifestyles, most of which are heavily edited or selectively curated. Teenagers, in their formative years of developing self-identity and self-esteem, are particularly susceptible to these portrayals, often engaging in detrimental comparisons that erode their self-worth. The unattainable standards set forth by influencers and peers alike contribute to a spectrum of psychological issues, including body dysmorphia and eating disorders. The quest for validation through likes and comments becomes a perilous journey towards an ever-elusive ideal, detracting from the appreciation of one's uniqueness and real-world accomplishments. Lastly, excessive use of social media can significantly disrupt physical activities and sleep patterns among teenagers. The magnetic allure of social media keeps teens tethered to their devices, often at the expense of engaging in physical exercise or adhering to healthy sleep routines. The blue light emitted by screens is known to interfere with the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for regulating sleep, thereby affecting sleep quality and duration. The sedentary lifestyle encouraged by hours of scrolling through social media feeds contributes to obesity and related health issues. Furthermore, the time spent on social media is time not spent on physical or creative endeavors that could significantly enhance a teenager's development and sense of wellbeing. In conclusion, while social media promises to connect and entertain, its dark underbelly reveals a significant threat to the mental and physical health of teenagers. Cyberbullying, unrealistic standards of beauty and success, and the disruption of physical activities and sleep are among the pressing concerns that warrant attention. It is imperative for parents, educators, and policymakers to address these issues head-on, establishing robust frameworks to mitigate the negative impacts of social media. Encouraging responsible usage, fostering environments that promote open communication about its effects, and highlighting the importance of real-world connections are crucial steps towards safeguarding the wellbeing of the younger generation. The time to act is now, to ensure that the digital realm becomes a space of positive growth rather than a minefield of potential harm for our teenagers."},{"prompt":"Can you give me 5 statistics on the effects of social media on youth","completion":"Certainly! Here are five statistics that highlight the effects of social media on youth: 1. **Mental Health and Cyberbullying:** According to a 2019 report from the Pew Research Center, about 59% of U.S. teens have experienced some form of cyberbullying. This includes name-calling, spreading of false rumors, receiving unsolicited explicit images, physical threats, and having explicit images of them shared without their consent. 2. **Screen Time and Sleep:** A study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence found that high usage of social media and screen time was linked to poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration among teenagers. Teens who use social media for five hours or more per day are 70% more likely to fall asleep late than those who use it for less than an hour. 3. **Body Image:** Research from the National Eating Disorders Association suggests a correlation between social media use and body dissatisfaction. The association reports that about 88% of the women and 65% of the men who participated in their survey experienced pressure from media to maintain an unrealistic body shape, and more than half of teenage girls and nearly one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives. 4. **Social Media Addiction:** A study conducted by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK found that about 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds use the internet for social networking, and rates of anxiety and depression in young people have risen 70% in the past 25 years. Social media use has been described by some researchers as more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol. 5. **Impact on Academic Performance:** A survey by the American Psychological Association revealed that nearly one-third of teens say they feel overwhelmed due to social media use and that it distracts them from homework. Another report states that students who are regular users of social media tend to have lower academic performance compared to those who use it less frequently, with the constant interruptions and multitasking online leading to decreased attention spans and productivity. These statistics underscore the varied impact of social media on youth, ranging from mental health challenges to sleep patterns, body image concerns, potential addictive behaviors, and effects on academic performance."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems like your message may have been incomplete.

Установка переменной окружения OMP_NUM_THREADS: - В Linux можно установить переменную окружения OMP_NUM_THREADS перед выполнением программы, чтобы указать количество потоков для OpenMP. Например, \`export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4\` установит количество потоков равным 4. 2. Установка числа потоков внутри программы: - В программе можно установить количество потоков с помощью функции \`omp_set_num_threads(int num_threads)\` из библиотеки OpenMP. Например: \`\`\`c #include <omp.h> int main() { omp_set_num_threads(4); // установить 4 потока #pragma omp parallel { // параллельный код } return 0; } \`\`\` 3. Использование директивы \`num_threads\` на уровне параллельной области: - В рамках директивы \`pragma omp parallel\` можно указать количество потоков для данной параллельной области. Например: \`\`\`c #include <omp.h> int main() { #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4) { // параллельный код } return 0; } \`\`\` Указание количества потоков зависит от конкретных требований программы и алгоритма, который используется.

As children work on these projects, they must brainstorm ideas and act as good listeners to their group members. Teaching students active listening skills enhances collaborative ability as well as creativity. Students learn the fundamental skills of productive communication, respect for others, and teamwork while generating ideas together. Negotiating how to collectively solve a problem is also part of PBL. At the end of the project, students do a self-evaluation. They evaluate not only their learning, but also the success of their social interactions. They reflect on their communication skills, if they felt they listened well to other students’ ideas, and if they believed their own opinions were heard. Consistent employment and practice of these skills will strengthen them over time and lead to proficiency and mastery. These skills are critical to future success in the structures of our global economy.","completion":"社交学习增强协作技能 PBL促进社交学习，使孩子们练习并熟练掌握与沟通、谈判和协作等二十一世纪技能有关的技能。当孩子们在这些项目上工作时，他们必须集思广益，并成为团队成员的良好倾听者。教授学生积极倾听技能不仅增强了合作能力，也激发了创造力。学生们在共同产生想法的过程中学会了生产性沟通的基本技能，学会了尊重他人，学会了团队合作。协商如何共同解决问题也是PBL的一部分。 项目结束时，学生进行自我评价。他们不仅评估他们的学习情况，还评估社交互动的成功程度。他们反思他们的沟通技能，看看自己是否认真倾听其他学生的想法，以及自己的意见是否被理解。这些技能的持续应用和练习将随着时间的推移而得到加强，并最终达到熟练和精通的水平。这些技能对我们全球经济结构中未来的成功至关重要。"},{"prompt":"Differentiation Provides Intrinsic Motivation The element of choice is crucial for students’ success. Differentiation allows students to develop their own interests and pursue deeper learning. It also allows students to soar and learn at their own levels. Students use resources that are appropriate for their individual reading levels and compatible with their technology knowledge. One exciting feature provided by this intrinsic motivation is that students will often reach higher and attempt to read more challenging material to glean the information they seek. It is not unrealistic to suspect that students who are highly motivated will improve their reading abilities as they strive to understand and learn during PBL. Doppelt (2003), contends that students’ “motivation to learn their discipline and their willingness to work on their projects [for] longer hours indicate that they behave...like high achievers” (p. 264). In another study, attendance was found to be higher in PBL schools (Thomas 2000). These behaviors have positive effects on learning.","completion":"差异化提供内在动机 选择的因素对学生的成功至关重要。差异化让学生可以培养自己的兴趣，并追求更深入的学习。它还使学生可以在不同水平上飞跃并学习。学生使用适合其个人阅读水平并与其技术知识相配的资源。这种内在动机提供的令人兴奋的特点是，学生通常会更加努力地阅读更具挑战性的材料，以获取他们所需的信息。毫不夸张地说，高度自我激励的学生在PBL中努力理解和学习时，其阅读能力有望得到提高。多泊 (2003)认为，学生“对学习他们的学科的动力和愿意在其项目上投入更多时间表明他们表现得像高绩效者”(第264页)。在另一项研究中，PBL学校的出勤率更高(托马斯, 2000)。这些行为对学习有积极影响。"},{"prompt":"The active learning process of PBL takes students’ various learning styles and preferences into account. Students use a range of tools and resources to conduct their research. They also choose individual ways to demonstrate their learning in their final product. A child who prefers to be reflective may journal his learning in a diary format to share with peers. Others can read the diary and then write responses. A student who thinks in more of an analytic, mathematical way may elect to create a timeline of events or graph findings to present to his or her audience. Students also may select their preferred learning environment. Students may choose to work in a quiet library or a bustling hallway, lying down in the carpet area or sequestered in the cubby area. Children learn so much about themselves when they are empowered to make their own learning decisions. Children will reflect on these choices to ensure they are making the best decisions possible. The opportunity to make mistakes is part of the learning process. When we implement PBL, we allow children to discover who they are as learners. They become able to make better choices, whether relating to process, environment, or outcome, which enables them to become more independent and responsible for their own learning.","completion":"PBL的积极学习过程考虑了学生的不同学习风格和偏好。学生使用各种工具和资源进行研究。他们还选择个人方式来展示他们的学习成果。一个喜欢反思的孩子可能会以日记形式记录学习，与同伴分享。其他人可以阅读日记然后写回应。一个更偏向于分析、数学思维方式的学生可能会选择创作事件时间轴或绘制图形以展示给观众。学生还可以选择他们偏好的学习环境。学生可以选择在安静的图书馆或熙熙攘攘的走廊工作，躺在地毯区或藏身在隔间区。当孩子们有权做出自己的学习决策时，他们会对自己有更多了解。孩子们会反思这些选择，以确保他们做出最佳的决定。犯错误的机会是学习过程的一部分。当我们实施PBL时，我们允许孩子们发现自己作为学习者的本质。他们变得能够做出更好的选择，无论是与过程、环境还是结果相关，这使他们能够变得更加独立和对自己的学习负责。"},{"prompt":"Scaffolded instruction ensures success. Scaffolded instruction refers to the supports provided to students to assist them in making cognitive growth just beyond their reach. Students are involved in a discovery process when they first learn the structures of PBL, and they require much support and monitoring. Scaffolded instruction occurs in PBL when teachers use organizers that aid students in bridging the gaps that exists in knowledge and skill, and it makes the tasks manageable and achievable. As with most supports, scaffolds are temporary, and as the learner gains fluency in the skill, the supports are removed, leading to a self-confident and capable learner.","completion":"搭建式指导确保成功。搭建式指导是指为学生提供支持，帮助他们在认知发展的过程中取得略高于他们当前水平的成长。学生在首次学习PBL的结构时，会参与一个探索过程，此时他们需要大量的支持和监督。在PBL中，搭建式指导发生在教师使用组织者帮助学生弥合知识和技能中存在的差距，并使任务变得可管理和可实现。与大多数支持一样，搭建式支持是暂时的，随着学习者熟练掌握技能，支持将被移除，从而使学习者变得自信和能干。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

You can pass in a different starting balance by changing the parameter value in \`atm = ATM(100)\` within the \`main()\` function. - For simplicity, this example handles amounts as floats, which is generally not a good practice for dealing with money in production software due to precision issues. In real applications, consider using \`decimal.Decimal\`. - There are no checks for negative deposit or withdrawal amounts, meaning the user could potentially enter a negative number for deposits or withdrawals leading to unexpected behavior. - No persistent storage is used; the account balance will reset every time the program restarts. This sample is a starting point; you can expand it by adding features like user authentication, transaction history, or support for multiple accounts, depending on your requirements and Python proficiency."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

По началу они внушали доверие, качественный сайт, на котором размещены множество только положительных отзывов про автосалон, да и по приезду заведение казалось приличным.

На словах озвучили мне нормальную сумму, на которую я примерно и рассчитывал, так как до поездки к ним узнавал за это. Я честно говоря повелся и подписал договор купли продажи на новый авто, понадеявшись на порядочность дилера. Но увы, это порядочность им не приемлема, потому как меня запланировано собирались кинуть. После заключения договора я узнал, что мой автомобиль это автохлам и цена его максимум 100000. Я был в шоке, потому как реально он стоил 350000. Не офигели ли, на 250000 кидать??? Отказался от сделки, меня стали пугать неустойкой. Я стал пугать экспертизой и судом. Но эти твари все равно поимели с меня 10000, за якобы работу их экспертов.

На каждый звонок – отписки и обещания перезвонить. Это просто издевательство! Вот вам и качество сервиса. Как можно так относиться к клиентам, разве мы не заслуживаем уважения и честности? Позорище, а не автосалон! 3. Я в полном ауте от \\"профессионализма\\" в Декаре. Сказали, что все документы будут готовы через пару дней, а тянули более двух недель! Авто обещали проверенное, но по факту вылезли проблемы с двигателем. Это что за обслуживание такое, за которое я заплатил немалые деньги? Расписываются в собственной некомпетентности? Ни рекомендации, ни извинений – только мое время и деньги потрачены впустую. Испортили всю радость от покупки, вместо восторга – одни хлопоты. 4. Отзыв о Декар? Обидно даже вспоминать. Думал, покупка автомобиля будет приятным волнением, а столкнулся с катастрофой. Сначала менеджеры были предупредительны, но как только перешли к оформлению, началась клоунада. Никакой прозрачности в сделке, куча скрытых платежей. Пытался выяснить, за что именно взимаются дополнительные средства, ответа так и не получил. Остался с ощущением, что меня просто обманули. Как можно так низко падать ради прибыли? 5. Я в шоке и негодовании от службы поддержки Декар. Такое впечатление, что они тренируются на клиентах, как отбиваться от вопросов, не давая конкретных ответов. Возникла проблема с ПТС – так и не смогли адекватно ее решить. Обещали \\"проверить информацию\\" и так неделями. Честно, лучше бы я купил авто с рук, чем через такой автосалон, где клиенты для них – это просто способ заработать деньги, а не люди.

It is a combination drug that contains two active ingredients: bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide. Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that works by reducing the heart rate and the heart's workload, making the heart beat more slowly and with less force. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic (water pill) that helps reduce blood pressure by removing excess salt and water from the body through urine. This combination of a beta-blocker and a diuretic effectively lowers blood pressure, which can help prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems. Like all medications, Concor Plus can have some side effects, and it's important for patients to be aware of these and discuss them with their healthcare provider. Patients taking Concor Plus should follow their doctor's instructions regarding dosage, as this can vary depending on their individual health condition and response to treatment. It's also important for patients on this medication to maintain regular check-ups with their healthcare provider to monitor their progress and make any necessary adjustments to their treatment regimen."},{"prompt":"TE PASARE UN LISTADO DE PALABRAS CLAVE PARA QUE HAGAS TITULOS SEO OPTIMIZADOS con un tono llamativo, que incite al click. - LA PALABRA CLAVE DEBE APARECER EN EL TITULO SOLO 1 VEZ YO TE PASARE EL LISTADO DE LAS PALABRAS CLAVE QUE SON DE LA TEMATICA DE “EXCEL” DEBE SER TITULOS NO MUY LARGOS, CORTOS E PRECISOS .

Говорят черные 1658000 р, дефицитный цвет. Ну и с кредитом протащили. Заявку подал в сбер на авто под 9% через них, отказали. Первый автомобиль по автокредиту должен быть меньше миллиона. Менеджеры гнали на банк. И предложили потребительскую хню под 27%. через свои каналы. Название банка до этого ни разу не слышал. Неоправданно дорого и не вызывает доверия. Слишком большая выплата в месяц получается. Не стал связываться. Атмосфера в салоне болото. Видно, что пытаются нажиться и менеджеры из кожи лезут, чтобы впарить свой кредит даже в ущерб здравому смыслу. но получается через пень колоду — раз за разом-то одно и тоже и еще через клиента или даже чаще отказы получать. Злятся и выходят из себя. Не посоветую.","completion":"1. Абсолютный кошмар этот салон Декар! Решил прикупить новенький SUV, да что там новенький – хотя бы в приличном состоянии. Обещали \\"огромный выбор\\" и \\"наилучшие условия покупки\\". А по факту? Полный обман. Цены на сайте и реальность - две большие разницы. Заинтересовался одной моделью по приятной цене, но когда дошло до дела, оказалось что стоимость на 30% выше из-за \\"невидимых\\" наценок типа расширенной гарантии, которую я даже не просил! И это ещё не всё, предложенные условия кредитования - это просто какой-то беспредел. Проценты заоблачные, и всё это под давлением, словно бы это единственный шанс в жизни купить авто. Обсуждать что-либо - бесполезно, как будто говоришь со стеной. Ушёл, не купив ничего, атмосфера удушливая, только время потерял. 2. Ну вот и я попал в ловушку салона Декар. Приехал за новым автомобилем, а попал на карусель из странных условий и хитрых уловок. Презентуют машину как лучшее, что только можно заработать, а когда доходит до оформления - начинается цирк. Дополняют стоимость разными \\"опциями\\", которые я даже не заказывал. И когда я начал возражать, мне сразу же начали давить на жалость и вешать лапшу на уши про \\"особые условия только для вас\\". На выходе предложили кредит с такой переплатой, что проще на лошади передвигаться. Не рекомендую сюда обращаться, если цените свои нервы и кошелёк. 3. Как только не пожалеешь о своём решении зайти в салон Декар... Подыскивал себе небольшой городской автомобиль, но получил кучу головной боли в подарок. Предложили мне \\"эксклюзивный\\" автомобиль по \\"специальной цене\\", которая оказалась выше рыночной на сотни тысяч. А когда я начал уточнять детали, такое впечатление, что менеджеры играют в молчанку – конкретных ответов не дождёшься! При попытке обсудить условия кредитования, меня пытались запутать ещё сильнее, предлагая сомнительные схемы оплаты. Успешно избежал покупки и потратил лишь своё время. Остался разочарован и без автомобиля. 4. Жесть, что творится в салоне \\"Декар\\", это просто пытка для покупателя! Мечтал обновить свою старую тачку, но вместо этого получил мастер-класс по выносливости. Ценник на авто внезапно \\"подрос\\" в процессе оформления, а когда я поинтересовался, почему так, ответ был \\"мелкий шрифт\\" в условиях, которые, конечно, никто заранее не объясняет. Стали уговаривать на покупку дополнений, без которых я спокойно обходился бы, а когда я отказался, отношение менеджера изменилось как день и ночь. Ощущение, что ты не клиент, а цель для \\"охоты\\". Вышел оттуда с чувством глубокого разочарования и без авто. 5. Как я жалею, что пришёл в этот автосалон Декар... Мечтал о спокойной покупке новенького седана, но попал в автомобильный ад. Стоимость автомобиля в процессе общения раза в два выше объявленной - оказывается, в стоимость изначально не включены \\"обязательные\\" услуги. Про кредитные условия даже говорить страшно: проценты, от которых волосы дыбом становятся. Беседа с менеджерами превращается в бесконечный спор, где твои аргументы игнорируются, а их \\"выгодные\\" предложения звучат как угроза. Ушел, чувствуя себя обманутым и ограбленным, даже не купив авто. Опыт ужасающий, не советую никому."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's how you can set up Apache HTTP Server on SLES 15: 1. Install Apache HTTP Server by running the following command: \`\`\` sudo zypper install apache2 \`\`\` 2. Start the Apache service and enable it to start on boot by running the following commands: \`\`\` sudo systemctl start apache2 sudo systemctl enable apache2 \`\`\` 3. Place the files you want to expose for download in the \`/srv/www/htdocs/\` directory. You can either copy the files directly to this directory or create a subdirectory to organize your files. 4. Access the files through a web browser by entering the IP address or hostname of your SLES 15 server in the address bar followed by the file path. For example, if your server's IP address is 192.168.1.100 and you placed a file named \`example.txt\` in the \`/srv/www/htdocs/\` directory, you can access the file by entering the following URL in your web browser: \`\`\` http://192.168.1.100/example.txt \`\`\` Alternatively, you can create HTML links on a webpage to make the files easily accessible for download. 5. If you want to restrict access to certain files or directories, you can configure Apache's access control settings in the \`/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\` or \`/etc/apache2/default-server.conf\` file. Now your Apache HTTP Server on SLES 15 is set up and ready to expose files for download.

Bu örnekte, basit bir hareket algılama mekanizması oluşturacağız. Hareket algılandığında, sistem bir alarm sesi çalacaktır. Bu projeyi gerçekleştirmek için öncelikle \`opencv-python\` ve \`pygame\` kütüphanelerini kurmanız gerekiyor. Bunları kurmak için terminalinizde veya komut isteminizde aşağıdaki komutları çalıştırabilirsiniz: \`\`\`bash pip install opencv-python pip install pygame \`\`\` \`pygame\` kütüphanesi, alarm sesi çalmak için kullanılacaktır.

Ayrıca, hareketin minimum alanını belirlemek için \`cv2.contourArea(contour) > 5000\` değerini kendi gereksinimlerinize göre ayarlayabilirsiniz. Eğer istenilen hareketin büyüklüğüne göre hassasiyeti ayarlamak istiyorsanız, \`cv2.contourArea(contour) > 5000\` kod satırındaki değeri değiştirebilirsiniz. Bu değer, algılanacak minimum piksel alanını temsil eder. Daha küçük hareketleri algılamak için bu değeri azaltabilir, daha büyük hareketler için ise bu değeri artırabilirsiniz. Bu kod, temel bir hareket algılama uygulamasıdır ve daha karmaşık senaryolar için geliştirilebilir.

**召回率** = （正确返回的相关项目数）/ （实际存在的相关项目总数） - 在这个例子中，如果实际有300张相关图片，那么召回率 = 200 / 300 = 0.67 或 67% 召回率越高，意味着系统能够从整个数据库中召回更多的相关项目，这通常是提升用户体验和系统性能的关键因素。特别是在信息检索、推荐系统等应用中，高召回率能够确保用户不会错过可能感兴趣的项目。 然而，召回率并不是评价一个系统好坏的唯一指标。在实际应用中，还需要综合考虑其他指标，如准确率（Precision，即返回的结果中，真正相关的项目所占的比例）和查询速度等，以达到最佳的性能平衡。通常情况下，召回率与准确率之间会存在一定的权衡。"},{"prompt":"作为向量数据库的专家，我作为初学者，你帮我解释下 相识度距离的原理，并且他们有哪些计算分类以及有对应的哪些使用场景，以及使用要求和优缺点。","completion":"向量数据库在处理查询时，核心任务之一是衡量数据项之间的相似度或差异度。这种衡量通常通过计算向量之间的“相似度距离”完成。向量之间的距离可以理解为它们在多维空间中的相对位置关系，距离越小意味着相似度越高，反之亦然。 # 相似度距离的原理 相似度距离的计算方法多种多样，每种方法都有其适用的场景和特点。这些方法的基础原理是将数据项表示为向量，通过数学方法计算它们之间的距离或角度差异来量化它们的相似度。 # 计算分类及使用场景 1. **欧氏距离（Euclidean Distance）** - **原理**: 两个向量在多维空间中的“直线”距离。 - **使用场景**: 物理空间中的距离测量，如位置追踪、图像特征的简单比较。 - **优点**: 直观、简单。 - **缺点**: 不适用于高维空间，可能因为维度的诅咒（Curse of Dimensionality）导致性能下降。 2. **余弦相似度（Cosine Similarity）** - **原理**: 计算两个向量之间的夹角，夹角越小，相似度越高。 - **使用场景**: 文本处理、信息检索，适用于评估文档或词汇之间的相似性。 - **优点**: 不受向量长度影响，适用于高维数据。 - **缺点**: 主要关注方向而非大小，可能不适用于所有场景。 3. **曼哈顿距离（Manhattan Distance）** - **原理**: 向量在各维度上的差值的绝对值之和。 - **使用场景**: 网格状结构的路径寻找，城市街区距离计算。 - **优点**: 在网格状或离散空间中效果良好。 - **缺点**: 在连续或非网格空间效果不佳。 4. **汉明距离（Hamming Distance）** - **原理**: 两个等长字符串之间的汉明距离是两个字符串对应位置的不同字符的个数。 - **使用场景**: DNA序列比较，错误检测和校正编码。 - **优点**: 在需要确切匹配度量时很有用。 - **缺点**: 只适用于等长序列的比较。 5. **杰卡德相似度（Jaccard Similarity）** - **原理**: 两个集合交集大小与并集大小之比。 - **使用场景**: 推荐系统，分类问题，适用于评估集合的相似度。 - **优点**: 不受重复元素影响，适合处理集合数据。 - **缺点**: 对于有大量重复元素的数据表现可能不佳。 # 使用要求和注意事项 - **明确问题和数据的性质**：选取适合问题特性的相似度距离计算方法非常关键。 - **考虑数据维度**：维数越高，某些距离度量（如欧氏距离）的效果可能会变差。 - **计算效率与精度的平衡**：在一些实时或大规模应用中，计算效率可能与精度出现权衡。 # 总结 每种相似度距离计算方法都有其适用场景和优缺点。选择合适的方法取决于应用的具体需求，包括数据的性质、问题域、以及对效率和精度的要求。理解这些基本原理和特性有助于在实际项目中作出更合理的选择。"},{"prompt":"比如学生摸一个题型做错了，我想提供给这个学生一个类似的题型的题目。这种用什么相识度距离来做比较合适呢？","completion":"在教育领域，特别是在提供针对学生错题的相似题型时，我们需要寻找一种方式来测量题目之间的相似度。这个情况需求比较独特，因为题目的相似性不仅仅依赖于表面的文字或数字相似度，还涉及到题目逻辑、解题策略和知识点等多个层面的相似性。 一个相对比较合适的做法是利用**语义相似度**的方法，结合**知识图谱**对题目进行比较。这里我们可以考虑以下几个方面： 1. **余弦相似度（Cosine Similarity）**于文本向量化后的题目描述进行比较，这对于评估题目的文字和概念性内容的相似度很有帮助。通过将题目描述转化为向量（例如使用TF-IDF或Word2Vec等方式），我们可以计算这些向量之间的余弦相似度。 2. **知识点匹配**：每个题目通常对应一定的知识点。如果两个题目涉及到相同的知识点或相关知识点，它们在逻辑和解题策略上会有较高的相似性。这需要建立一个知识图谱，用来表示各个知识点之间的关系。 3. **难度系数**：除了知识点和题目描述，难度系数也是比较题目相似度的一个重要因素。即使两个题目在内容上非常相似，但难度系数不同，也可能不适合作为针对特定错题的练习。 4. **结合多个度量**：在实际应用中，可能需要结合以上几种度量方法来综合评估题目之间的相似度。例如，可以先筛选出涉及相同知识点的题目，然后在这个基础上，进一步通过余弦相似度等方法比较题目描述的相似性，最终考虑难度系数的匹配。 综上所述，在这种应用场景下，没有单一的“最合适”的相似度距离计算方法。相反，需要一个综合考虑题目内容、知识点和难度等多个因素的方法。通过深度学习和自然语言处理技术的进步，我们现在可以更高效地提取和比较这些复杂的题目特征，从而为学生提供更加个性化和针对性的学习资源。"},{"prompt":"初中 高中数学的知识图谱还有吗","completion":"截止到我的最后更新（2023年4月），我无法直接访问或提供具体的初中和高中数学知识图谱的数据库或文件。然而，我可以说明知识图谱创建和使用的基本概念，以及你可以如何着手开发或寻找相关的资源。 # 知识图谱的基本概念 知识图谱是一种结构化的知识表示方法，它通过实体（节点）和实体之间的关系（边）来组织数据。在教育领域，这些实体通常是知识点、概念、定理、公式等，而实体之间的关系则是这些知识点之间的依赖、归属、类比等。 # 创建初中和高中数学知识图谱 创建一个初中和高中数学的知识图谱涉及几个步骤： 1. **收集知识点**：包括公式、定理、概念等，这需要对应的教育和数学背景知识。 2. **定义关系**：确定知识点之间的关系，包括但不限于前置知识、包含关系、应用关系等。 3. **构建模型**：使用图形数据库（如Neo4j）或其他适合表示图形结构的工具来构建和存储知识图谱。 4. **验证和迭代**：通过实际应用和反馈对知识图谱进行优化和完善。 # 寻找相关资源 虽然我不能直接提供具体的数据库或图谱，但以下方式或许能帮助你找到现有的资源或启发你如何创建自己的知识图谱： -

Her fingertips grace the water's surface, the illusory duality of her reflection in the depth embodying hidden knowledge and the untapped unconscious","completion":"The description you’ve provided paints a vivid and evocative image of the High Priestess tarot card, reimagined through an artistic lens reminiscent of Christine Ellger's style. Christine Ellger is known for her surreal, dreamlike photographic compositions, which often juxtapose elements in unexpected and thought-provoking ways. Applying this style to a tarot card, especially the High Priestess, adds layers of symbolism and depth to the interpretation of the card’s meaning. The High Priestess, in traditional tarot, is a symbol of hidden knowledge, intuition, and the subconscious mind. She sits at the threshold between the seen and unseen worlds, the conscious and the subconscious. The High Priestess represents the mysteries that cannot be easily articulated or understood in the light of rational thought; she deals with realms beyond the surface level of consciousness. In the reimagined scene you've provided, the High Priestess stands on a moonlit shore, suggesting a powerful connection with the moon, which is often associated with feminine energy, intuition, and the unconscious. The moonlit setting emphasizes the mystical and secretive aspects of the High Priestess, enhancing her association with the night, dreams, and the unseen realms of intuition and insight. Her form being \\"distorted and blurred in the rippling tide\\" suggests the elusive nature of the subconscious and the mysteries it holds. Water is a common symbol for emotions, the subconscious, and the flow of psychic intuition. The interaction between her fingertips and the water's surface, creating ripples, symbolizes the act of accessing the subconscious mind and the ripple effect such insights can have on one’s conscious life. The \\"illusory duality of her reflection\\" speaks to the concept of duality present in many interpretations of the High Priestess: consciousness and the subconscious, the seen and the unseen, the known and the unknown. This duality is at the heart of the High Priestess's symbolism, and the image of her reflection in the water perfectly embodies the exploration of these dual aspects of existence. Incorporating Christine Ellger’s art style into this description brings a dreamlike, surreal quality to the High Priestess, emphasizing the mystical and enigmatic aspects of the card. This approach invites a more introspective and imaginative engagement with the card, encouraging the viewer to delve into the depths of their own subconscious and intuition to discover hidden truths and insights."},{"prompt":"Icebones' Hierophant: A warped figure shrouded in unearthly shadow preaches to an assembly of specters in a haunting cathedral of ice. A chilling representation of tradition, conventional wisdom, but flavored with an icy bite of dogmatism","completion":"The vivid imagery you've crafted for the \\"Icebones' Hierophant\\" is a unique and imaginative reinterpretation of the traditional Hierophant tarot card. Traditionally, the Hierophant represents tradition, conformity, education, and belief systems. It's often associated with a spiritual or religious leader who acts as a bridge between humanity and the divine, guiding followers according to established doctrines and practices. The card can also signify institutions and their established values. In your reimagined version, the Hierophant's typical portrayal within structured religion or traditional educational systems is transformed into a more mystical and perhaps darker figure, preaching to an assembly of specters in a \\"haunting cathedral of ice.\\" This icy, spectral environment and congregation shift the focus of the Hierophant's guidance from the warmth of communal tradition and learning to a colder, more isolated stance, emphasizing the rigid, unyielding nature of dogma. The \\"warped figure shrouded in unearthly shadow\\" suggests a perversion or extreme interpretation of the Hierophant's traditional role. Rather than embodying wisdom and authority in a nurturing sense, this figure seems to impose its will, its teachings hardened and cold as the ice surrounding it. This could serve as a critique or warning against blindly following tradition without questioning or understanding its underlying principles and motives. The presence of specters as the congregation is particularly evocative; they could represent souls lost to or trapped by the icy grip of dogmatism, unable to progress or think freely due to the chilling effects of rigid tradition. These specters could also imply that the teachings being imparted in this icy cathedral are outdated or no longer relevant to the living, yet they are upheld by the hierophant as immutable truths. The choice of an \\"icy bite of dogmatism\\" perfectly complements the traditional meanings associated with the Hierophant, introducing a nuanced layer that speaks to the dangers of unyielding adherence to conventions or authority. This chilling representation prompts introspection about our own practices, beliefs, and the authority figures we choose to follow. It suggests that while tradition and guidance have their places, they should not become so rigid as to stifle growth, innovation, or personal freedom of thought. Your reinterpretation of the Hierophant into this ice-themed scene laden with spectral followers and an eerie atmosphere beautifully highlights the complexities and potential pitfalls of tradition, conventional wisdom, and dogma, urging a more discerning and flexible approach to the structures and authorities that guide us."},{"prompt":"How to confirm a balance of a bitcoin regtest private key, matching the mainnet with its corresponding address, on the electrum mainnet?","completion":"Confirming the balance of a Bitcoin private key designed for Regtest (Regression Test Mode) on the Electrum mainnet involves several steps and important considerations. It's crucial to understand the distinct differences between Regtest, Testnet, and Mainnet in the Bitcoin ecosystem: 1. **Regtest (Regression Test Mode)**: This is a private testing network used by developers. It allows them to control block creation and can be used to test transaction without real money involved. It operates in a sandbox for the specific developer or group of developers. 2. **Testnet**: This is the global Bitcoin test network that mimics the Bitcoin Mainnet. It's used by developers to test Bitcoin transactions without using real bitcoins. 3. **Mainnet**: This is the primary network where actual Bitcoin transactions occur. The coins on this network have real value. Given these differences, it's important to highlight that a private key from the Regtest will not directly correspond to funds on the Mainnet because the two networks operate independently, and the transactions or balances on one do not reflect on the other. **However, if your aim is to check the balance of a Mainnet address (that matches the private key originally used in Regtest), following these steps might help, given you are aware and cautious of the security implications:** # Preliminary Steps: - Ensure that Electrum is installed and that you're familiar with its operation. - **Caution:** Importing your private keys into third-party wallets can expose your funds to theft if the application is compromised or malicious. # Importing a Private Key into Electrum: 1. **Launch Electrum**: Start Electrum on your computer. If you haven’t already installed it, download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions. 2. **Create a New Wallet**: Electrum will ask you to create a new wallet. Choose \\"Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys\\" and then proceed. 3. **Enter the Private Key**: Type the private key you want to check the balance for and continue. This key should correspond to a Bitcoin Mainnet address. 4. **Synchronization**: After setup, Electrum will sync to the Bitcoin network to retrieve transactions related to the imported private key. This process may take some time depending on the network connection and the number of transactions. 5. **Check Balance**: Once synchronized, you will be able to see the balance and transaction history for the address corresponding to the imported private key. # Important Security Note: - It's strongly recommended to not reuse addresses or private keys that have been exposed or used for testing purposes, especially in a development environment like Regtest. For actual transactions involving real funds on the Mainnet, consider generating a new address and private key within a secure environment. Finally, always ensure that your Electrum wallet and all other cryptocurrency tools are up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility with the latest network protocols."},{"prompt":"No! I managed to make the regtest private keys and addresses matching the mainnet!","completion":"If you've managed to create Regtest private keys and addresses that match those on the Bitcoin Mainnet, it implies you've generated addresses using the same cryptographic methods (e.g., using the same elliptic curve parameters and hashing algorithms) that are valid across both networks. This is technically feasible because Bitcoin addresses are derived from public keys, which in turn are derived from private keys, following the same cryptographic principles regardless of the network (Mainnet, Testnet, or Regtest). However, it's crucial to understand that while the addresses might be technically identical in format and derivation, the balances and transactions associated with them on the Regtest network and the Mainnet are entirely separate. The Regtest network is isolated and used for development purposes, meaning any transactions or balances on Regtest do not exist on the Mainnet and vice versa. If your goal is to check the balance of these addresses on the Mainnet using Electrum, here's how you can do it, keeping in mind the security precautions mentioned previously: # Using Electrum to Check Balance for a Mainnet Address: 1. **Open Electrum**: Ensure you're using the latest version of Electrum for security and compatibility reasons. 2. **Create a New Wallet for Watching**: Instead of importing the private key directly (which poses a security risk), you can create a watch-only wallet using the public address. This allows you to monitor the balance and transactions without exposing your private key. Select \`File\` > \`New/Restore\`, enter a name for your new wallet, and choose \`Standard wallet\` > \`Use a master key\`. Here, you can input your address. 3. **Synchronize**: Electrum will synchronize with the Bitcoin Mainnet to retrieve the transaction history and balance for the provided address. This process can take some time. 4. **View Balance**: Once synchronized, you'll be able to see the balance and transaction history for the address. # Security Considerations: - **Private Key Exposure**: Importing your private key into any online device or software can expose it to potential theft. Always consider the security implications. - **Watch-Only Wallets**: Using a watch-only wallet in Electrum allows you to monitor addresses without exposing your private keys, offering a safer alternative to direct key importation. # Conclusion: While you can generate addresses that are valid on both Regtest and Mainnet, the transactions and balances will not overlap due to the isolated nature of these networks. Using Electrum's watch-only feature is a secure way to monitor your Mainnet addresses without risking your private keys. Always prioritize security and privacy when handling cryptocurrency keys and addresses."},{"prompt":"How to get master key from the bitcoin core?","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, Bitcoin Core does not directly use the concept of a \\"master key\\" in the way that hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets like Electrum do. Bitcoin Core does support HD wallets since version 0.13.0, but it doesn't expose a master private key (xprv) or master public key (xpub) in the user interface or through a simple RPC command in a straightforward manner like some other wallet software. HD wallets generate all of their addresses from a single seed, with the master keys being the root from which these addresses are derived. In wallets that use this system, knowing the master key allows the user (or anyone who has it) to generate all the addresses and private keys in the wallet, hence it's crucial to keep it secure. # Extracting HD Wallet Information in Bitcoin Core If you're using Bitcoin Core and want to extract HD wallet information, you might be looking for the wallet's extended public key (xpub) or something similar. Here's a general approach to finding related information: 1. **Backup Your Wallet**: Always ensure you have a current backup of your wallet.dat file before attempting to extract or manipulate wallet data. 2. **Use the dumpwallet RPC**: Bitcoin Core provides a \`dumpwallet\` RPC command that exports all wallet private keys to a text file, along with some additional information. This command might include the HD seed (if the wallet is HD), but it won't directly give you an \\"xpub\\". \`\`\` dumpwallet \\"filename\\" \`\`\` Replace \`\\"filename\\"\` with the path where you want to save the dump file. Be careful with this file, as it contains sensitive data. 3. **Finding the HD Seed**: If your wallet is an HD wallet, the \`dumpwallet\` output will include the HD seed (look for a line starting with \`# HD seed\`). This seed is the basis for all key generation in the wallet but is not the same as an xpub. It's more akin to the root from which the master private key is derived. 4. **Deriving Extended Keys**: Deriving the actual master private key (xprv) or master public key (xpub) from the HD seed or any other information in Bitcoin Core is not straightforward and typically requires external tools or libraries capable of handling BIP32 (the HD wallet standard). Libraries like \`libbitcoin\`, \`bitcoinjs-lib\` (for JavaScript), or \`pycoin\` (for Python) can derive these keys if you provide the seed or root key. # Important Security Note Be extremely cautious when handling seeds, master keys, or any cryptographic material. Exposing these to an insecure environment, malicious software, or the internet can lead to loss of funds. Perform such operations offline, on a secure device, and only if you fully understand the risks and procedures. # Conclusion Bitcoin Core is primarily focused on node operation and transaction verification, and while it supports HD wallets, it doesn't offer an easy way to manage or expose master keys as some other wallet software does. For advanced operations like deriving master keys or handling seeds, you might need to use additional tools or libraries, always with a strong emphasis on security."},{"prompt":"write an email to ask each department to provide staff name on the seating plan for relocation and future use.

Execution tactics in malware 1.1. General overview of existing cyber attacks 1.2. Methods and means used to carry out cyber attacks 1.3. Committing cyber attacks using execution tactics 1.4. Conclusions on the first chapter You can add some useful technical information","completion":"Chapter 1: **Execution Tactics in Malware** 1.1. **General Overview of Existing Cyber Attacks** The digital age, while providing numerous advantages, has also spawned various forms of cyber attacks that threaten the security and integrity of data across the globe. Cyber attacks leverage different strategies to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, including but not limited to, viruses, ransomware, phishing, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. These attacks can lead to significant financial losses, disruption of services, and theft of sensitive information. Understanding the landscape of these threats is the first step in developing mechanisms to detect and prevent such attacks effectively. 1.2. **Methods and Means Used to Carry Out Cyber Attacks** Cyber attacks are carried out using a myriad of methods, each designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities or to take advantage of the user's lack of awareness. Common methods include: - **Malware**: Software specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. - **Social Engineering**: Manipulative techniques that trick users into giving away sensitive information or access to their systems. - **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Where attackers intercept communication between two parties to steal or manipulate the data being exchanged. - **SQL Injection**: Where attackers inject malicious SQL code into a database to gain access to or manipulate the data. Each of these methods requires a unique approach for detection and prevention, making it crucial for cybersecurity measures to be adaptive and robust. 1.3. **Committing Cyber Attacks Using Execution Tactics** Execution tactics refer to the techniques employed by cybercriminals to execute malicious code within a target system without detection. These tactics often rely on exploiting system vulnerabilities, such as unpatched software or insecure system configurations, and leveraging sophisticated methodologies to evade detection mechanisms. A common execution tactic involves living-off-the-land (LotL) binaries and scripts, which use legitimate system tools for malicious purposes, making detection significantly more challenging. Furthermore, fileless malware attacks, which reside entirely in memory and leave minimal footprints, represent another advanced execution tactic, complicating the traditional antivirus-based detection approaches. Understanding the execution tactics employed can aid in developing targeted strategies for detection and prevention, such as behavior analysis, anomaly detection, and adopting a zero-trust security model that assumes breach and verifies each request as if it originates from an untrusted network. 1.4. **Conclusions on the First Chapter** The evolving landscape of cyber threats necessitates a profound understanding of the tactics employed by cybercriminals, especially concerning the execution of malicious payloads. Traditional security measures often fall short in detecting and mitigating such threats due to their reliance on signature-based detection and inability to adapt to sophisticated execution tactics. Therefore, it becomes imperative to incorporate advanced detection methodologies, such as machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection, behavior-based analysis, and adopting comprehensive security frameworks that account for the diverse nature of cyber threats. Furthermore, education and awareness programs play a crucial role in preventing successful cyber attacks. By understanding the common methods and execution tactics used by attackers, organizations and individuals can better prepare and protect themselves from potential threats. This chapter laid the groundwork for analyzing cyber attacks, with a focus on execution tactics, setting the stage for discussing detection and prevention mechanisms in subsequent chapters."},{"prompt":"Make chapter bigger","completion":"Expanding on the initial framework, let's delve deeper into each section with more technical details and analysis. --- **Chapter 1: Execution Tactics in Malware** **1.1. General Overview of Existing Cyber Attacks** Cyber attacks have evolved from simple nuisances to complex, sophisticated threats that target every aspect of digital life. The variety of attacks include, but are not limited to: - **Viruses and Worms**: Malicious programs designed to replicate and spread to other computers, often damaging systems or stealing data. - **Ransomware**: Malware that encrypts a victim's files, with the attacker demanding payment for the decryption key. - **Phishing**: Deceptive communications, usually emails, designed to steal sensitive data like login credentials and credit card numbers. - **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Prolonged and targeted cyberattacks where attackers infiltrate a network to steal data over time. Each of these attacks represents a significant risk to individuals and organizations, highlighting the critical need for effective cybersecurity measures. **1.2. Methods and Means Used to Carry Out Cyber Attacks** Attacks are meticulously planned and executed using a range of methods, including but not limited to: - **Drive-by Downloads**: Where software is unknowingly downloaded from the internet, exploiting a web browser, app, or OS vulnerability. - **Exploit Kits**: Tools that attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities in software on the victim’s computer to install malware. - **Credential Stuffing**: Automated attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems using stolen username-password pairs. - **Zero-Day Exploits**: Attacks targeting software vulnerabilities that are unknown to the vendor and therefore have no patch available. The sophistication of these methods illustrates the advanced capabilities of modern cyber adversaries and the importance of equally sophisticated defense mechanisms. **1.3. Committing Cyber Attacks Using Execution Tactics** Execution tactics enable attackers to run malicious code within a system stealthily. These include, but are not limited to: - **Process Injection**: Injecting malicious code into legitimate processes to evade detection by leveraging trusted, benign applications to conduct malicious activities. - **PowerShell Exploitation**: Utilizing the powerful scripting language built into Windows to execute commands that download and run malicious code. - **Macro-based Malware**: Embedding malware in macros within documents that execute when the document is opened, often bypassing traditional security measures. - **Scheduled Task Abuse**: Malware that sets tasks to run at specific times, leveraging native task scheduling tools to persist on a system undetected. Each tactic requires specific detection and prevention strategies, emphasizing the need for advanced, multi-layered security solutions. **1.4. Conclusions on the First Chapter** The continuous evolution of cyber threats necessitates a dynamic and adaptive approach to cybersecurity. Understanding the variety of cyber attacks and the methods used to carry them out is foundational for developing effective defense mechanisms. Traditional security measures are often inadequate against modern execution tactics, underscoring the importance of advanced detection technologies such as machine learning, behavior analytics, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Moreover, the role of education and awareness cannot be overstated. A well-informed user base can dramatically reduce the risk of successful attacks. Continuous training and updates on the latest cyber threat trends are essential components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. As we progress into detailed discussions on detection and prevention mechanisms in the following chapters, it's clear that a proactive, informed, and technology-driven approach is critical in safeguarding against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. This extended overview sets a more detailed context for the subsequent exploration of methodologies to detect and counteract cyber threats, focusing on execution tactics as a pivotal element in the anatomy of advanced cyber attacks."},{"prompt":"come funziona la skolemizzazione?","completion":"La skolemizzazione è un processo utilizzato nella logica matematica, in particolare nella logica del primo ordine, per eliminare i quantificatori esistenziali. Questa trasformazione è importante soprattutto nell'ambito della dimostrazione automatica dei teoremi e nella programmazione logica. Lo scopo della skolemizzazione è di convertire una formula in una forma equivalente che è più gestibile per l'elaborazione automatica, mantenendo inalterata la sua soddisfacibilità. Il processo prende il nome dal matematico norvegese Thoralf Skolem. Ecco una descrizione di come funziona la skolemizzazione, spiegata in modo semplice: **Passo 1: Forma prenex** Prima di procedere con la skolemizzazione, è necessario che la formula sia in forma prenex, cioè tutti i quantificatori devono essere spostati all'inizio della formula. Per fare ciò, si utilizzano le leggi della logica per spostare i quantificatori e cambiare opportunamente i limiti delle variabili. **Passo 2: Eliminare i quantificatori universali** Il prossimo passo è ignorare temporaneamente i quantificatori universali (forall) durante il processo di skolemizzazione. Questo passaggio è possibile perché lo scopo della skolemizzazione è eliminare i quantificatori esistenziali (exists), e i quantificatori universali non influenzano direttamente questa operazione. **Passo 3: Skolemizzazione dei quantificatori esistenziali** Ogni volta che si incontra un quantificatore esistenziale, si elimina sostituendolo con una funzione di Skolem. Questa funzione è un simbolo di funzione nuovo e unico, che non appare da nessuna altra parte nella formula. La funzione di Skolem dipenderà da tutte le variabili quantificate universalmente che hanno una portata che include il quantificatore esistenziale che stiamo eliminando. Se non ci sono quantificatori universali che influenzano il quantificatore esistenziali, si introduce una costante di Skolem (che è un caso speciale di funzione di Skolem con zero argomenti). Ecco un esempio per chiarire: Sia data la formula: (forall x exists y (P(x, y))) Per skolemizzare, si sostituisce (y) con una funzione di Skolem che dipende da (x), ad esempio (f(x)), ottenendo: (forall x (P(x, f(x)))) Questo ci ha permesso di eliminare il quantificatore esistenziale creando una nuova formula, la cui soddisfacibilità è equivalente alla formula originale, ma senza quantificatori esistenziali. **Conclusione:** La formula risultante dalla skolemizzazione è priva di quantificatori esistenziali e quindi più facilmente manipolabile da algoritmi per la risoluzione di problemi logici. Va notato che, mentre la skolemizzazione preserva la soddisfacibilità della formula originale (ovvero, se la formula originale è soddisfacibile, anche la formula skolemizzata lo è), essa può alterare la verità in senso stretto. Cioè, non preserva necessariamente l'equivalenza logica, ma assicura che se esiste un modello per la formula skolemizzata, allora esisteva un modello anche per la formula originale."},{"prompt":"Fammi un esempio in cui viene introdotta una costante di skolem","completion":"Ecco un semplice esempio di skolemizzazione in cui viene introdotta una costante di Skolem. L'uso di una costante di Skolem avviene quando eliminiamo un quantificatore esistenziale che non è \\"dominato\\" da alcun quantificatore universale. **Formula Originale:** Supponiamo di avere la seguente formula logica del primo ordine: [ exists x P(x) ] Questa formula afferma che esiste almeno un elemento (x) tale per cui la proprietà (P(x)) è vera. **Passo 1: Identificare i quantificatori** La formula contiene un solo quantificatore, che è esistenziale ((exists)). Non ci sono quantificatori universali che lo dominano, quindi procediamo direttamente alla Skolemizzazione. **Passo 2: Skolemizzazione** Per skolemizzare la formula, dobbiamo rimuovere il quantificatore esistenziale sostituendo la variabile (x) con una costante di Skolem. Essendo che non ci sono quantificatori universali che influenzano (x), usiamo una costante. Supponiamo di scegliere come costante di Skolem (c). La nostra formula diventa: [ P(c) ] **Risultato** Abbiamo eliminato il quantificatore esistenziale introducendo una costante di Skolem (c). La formula risultante (P(c)) afferma che la proprietà (P) è vera per un particolare elemento (c). La presenza di (c) in questo contesto implica l'esistenza di almeno un elemento per cui (P) è vera, senza specificare di chi si tratta. Questo metodo mantiene la soddisfacibilità della formula originale: se la formula originale è soddisfacibile (ovvero, esiste almeno un elemento per cui (P) è vero), allora anche la formula skolemizzata è soddisfacibile. La skolemizzazione in questo caso ha trasformato una formula che afferma l'esistenza di un generico elemento con certa proprietà in una formula che afferma la presenza di un elemento specifico, identificato dalla costante di Skolem, che soddisfa tale proprietà. Questo è particolarmente utile nelle procedure di prova in cui gestire entità specifiche anziché entità generiche può semplificare la manipolazione logica e computazionale."},{"prompt":"Fammi vedere un esempio in cui si introduce sia una funzione che una costante","completion":"Consideriamo la seguente formulazione logica del primo ordine che richiederà l'introduzione sia di una costante di Skolem che di una funzione di Skolem durante il suo processo di skolemizzazione: **Formula Originale:** [ exists x forall y exists z P(x, y, z) ] Questa formula afferma che esiste un (x) tale per cui, per ogni (y), esiste un (z) tale che la proprietà (P(x, y, z)) è vera. **Passo 1: Identificare i quantificatori e trasformare in forma prenex** La formula è già in forma prenex, con un quantificatore esistenziale seguito da un quantificatore universale e infine da un altro quantificatore esistenziale. Quindi, possiamo procedere direttamente alla skolemizzazione. **Passo 2: Skolemizzazione** 1. **Eliminare il primo quantificatore esistenziale ((x))**: Per il primo quantificatore esistenziale (exists x), non c'è alcun quantificatore universale che lo domina, quindi introduciamo una **costante di Skolem** (c), sostituendo ogni occorrenza di (x) con (c). Formula risultante: (forall y exists z P(c, y, z)) 2. **Eliminare il secondo quantificatore esistenziale ((z))**: Ora, abbiamo un quantificatore esistenziale (exists z) che è dominato da un quantificatore universale (y). In questo caso, sostituiamo (z) con una **funzione di Skolem** che dipende da (y), diciamo (f(y)), inserendola ovunque appaia (z). Formula risultante: (forall y P(c, y, f(y))) **Risultato Finale:** La formula skolemizzata finale è (forall y P(c, y, f(y))). Questo implica che abbiamo sostituito: - Il quantificatore esistenziale (exists x) con una costante di Skolem (c), poiché non era condizionato da quantificatori universali. - Il quantificatore esistenziale (exists z), condizionato da (y) (per via del (forall y) che lo precede), con una funzione di Skolem (f(y)). In questo modo, siamo stati in grado di convertire una formula con quantificatori esistenziali in una formula senza, sostituendo variabili esistenziali con oggetti concreti: una costante (c) per rappresentare l'elemento esistenziale indipendente e una funzione (f(y)) per rappresentare l'elemento esistenziale che dipende da ogni (y). La formula risultante è più semplice da gestire in molti contesti computazionali, come la dimostrazione automatica dei teoremi, mantenendo equivalente la soddisfacibilità della formula originale."},{"prompt":"hello hello ! are you chat gpt 4 ?","completion":"Hello!

However, it appears to be a blend of two words: \\"travel\\" and \\"caravanserai.\\" \\"Travel\\" is self-explanatory, referring to the act of moving from one place to another, which can be done for many reasons including leisure, business, exploration, or pilgrimage. \\"Caravanserai\\" (also spelled \\"caravansary\\") is a term that may be less familiar to some. It refers to a roadside inn where travelers (caravaners) could rest and recover from the day's journey. Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, information, and people across the network of trade routes covering Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Europe, most notably along the Silk Road. These establishments provided water, food, lodging, and other refreshments to travelers and their animals. They were a vital part of the trade infrastructure in the regions where they were located, from the Middle Ages up until the advent of modern transportation made them obsolete. Thus, a \\"travelsarai\\" could theoretically refer to a modern concept or initiative inspired by the historical caravanserai, focusing on travel, comradery, and cultural exchange. This could be a modern hostel, hotel, or rest stop designed to cater to the needs of contemporary travelers while encapsulating the spirit and community feel of the ancient caravanserais. It might also be a brand name, project title, or a conceptual initiative aiming to enhance the travel experience through services, accommodations, or travel guidance rooted in the rich tradition of hospitality and travel support exemplified by the caravanserais. Without more context, it's hard to provide a precise definition, but I hope this offers a helpful exploration of what \\"travelsarai\\" could potentially denote."},{"prompt":"IT IS A TRAVEL AGENCY IN IRAN.","completion":"Thank you for clarifying. If \\"Travelsarai\\" is identified as a travel agency in Iran, it would be a business offering travel and tourism-related services to individuals or groups traveling to or within Iran. Travel agencies such as this typically provide a range of services including but not limited to booking accommodations, arranging for guided tours, providing information about historical and cultural sites, assisting with visas and travel documents, and organizing transportation within the country. Given Iran's rich history, diverse culture, and stunning landscapes, a travel agency like Travelsarai would likely focus on showcasing the nation's numerous attractions—from ancient ruins like Persepolis to bustling bazaars in cities like Tehran and Isfahan, to the natural beauty of its mountains and deserts. They might also offer specialized tours focusing on culinary experiences, traditional arts and crafts, or hiking and adventure sports in Iran's varied terrain. Travel agencies operating within countries like Iran play an essential role in opening up these destinations to international tourists, providing vital logistical support and local knowledge that can make a visit more enriching and enjoyable. They also serve as important bridges between cultures, helping to foster mutual understanding and respect through tourism. As of my last update, for specific information about their offerings, services, and packages, contacting Travelsarai directly or visiting their official website (if available) would be the best approach.

I stand before you to shed light on the profound and multifaceted harm social media inflicts upon our youth. In an era where the number of likes determines worth and where the curated highlights of others' lives set an unrealistic standard of success, we must ask ourselves: What cost does our children’s well-being pay for this digital validation? The evidence speaks volumes. Studies after studies reveal an alarming correlation between social media use and an increase in teen depression, anxiety, and even loneliness. Yes, in a world more connected than ever before, our youth stand isolated, their self-esteem tethered to the whims of online validation that is as fleeting as it is shallow. But the harm does not stop at mental health. Consider the erosion of privacy, where every moment is commodified, shared, and scrutinized. Our teenagers live under the relentless gaze of an invisible audience, pressured to maintain a facade that aligns with the ever-changing standards of online perfection. This is not merely disconcerting; it's a crisis that undermines the very essence of their individuality and self-worth. Moreover, the threat of cyberbullying looms large—a venomous byproduct of social media's anonymity and reach. Bullies no longer lurk in hallways but hide behind the screens, their words leaving scars deep in the psyche of their victims, contributing to a climate of fear and helplessness. Yet, in the face of these daunting challenges, hope is not lost. We have the power to reclaim the narrative and steer our society towards a path of healthful coexistence with technology. This necessitates robust dialogue, stringent legislation to protect our young, and a collective effort to foster an environment where social media serves as a tool for positive change rather than a weapon that fractures the fragile self-image of our youth. Let's encourage digital literacy that empowers our teenagers to navigate social media landscapes with discernment, resilience, and a strong sense of self. It is imperative that we promote real-life connections over digital ones, emphasizing the irreplaceable value of face-to-face interactions for emotional and psychological well-being. In conclusion, the time to act is now. We must awaken to the silent distress signals emitted from our screens and respond with decisive action. Let us commit to creating a future where our youth can leverage social media as a force for good—connecting, learning, and growing without the shadows of comparison, isolation, and cyberbullying darkening their journey.

Vrai ou faux ?","completion":"Vrai."},{"prompt":"descrivimi la tecnica del laser speckle","completion":"La tecnica del laser speckle, conosciuta anche come speckle pattern analysis, è un approccio ampiamente utilizzato nell'ottica per studiare la variazione della superficie o del movimento di un oggetto. Il termine \\"speckle\\" si riferisce a un modello di interferenza granulare che si produce quando la luce laser coerente si riflette (o si trasmette attraverso) una superficie ruvida e poi si sovrappone su un piano di osservazione. Il fenomeno dello speckle è una conseguenza diretta delle proprietà costruttive e distruttive dell'interferenza tra differenti onde di luce che sono riflesse da varie parti della superficie irregolare dell'oggetto in esame. Ogni punto sulla superficie riflettente contribuisce con un'onda con fase e ampiezza definite. Quando queste onde si combinano, il risultato è un modello complesso e apparentemente casuale di zone luminose e scure. # Applicazioni Principali: 1. **Misurazioni di Deformazione e Tensione**: Nell'ingegneria meccanica, il laser speckle è impiegato per misurare le piccole deformazioni e tensioni presenti nei materiali sottoposti a carichi esterni. Questo è realizzato confrontando i modelli di speckle ottenuti prima e dopo l'applicazione del carico, permettendo una mappatura dettagliata della deformazione. 2. **Velocimetria Laser Speckle (LSV)**: Questa tecnica è usata per misurare la velocità e il flusso in fluidi o sangue, basandosi sulla variazione nel tempo dei modelli speckle causata dal movimento delle particelle nel fluido. 3. **Imaging Biomedico**: Nel campo biomedico, la tecnica di speckle dinamico è utilizzata per monitorare il flusso sanguigno e le variazioni della microcircolazione nei tessuti vivi, fornendo informazioni critiche sulle condizioni fisiologiche o patologiche. # Principi Fondamentali: - **Coerenza**: Utilizza sorgenti laser perché la coerenza della luce è fondamentale per la formazione dei modelli speckle. - **Interferenza**: Si basa sull'interferenza di onde di luce che partono da punti con elevata differenza di cammino ottico a causa della rugosità della superficie. - **Analisi digitale**: Con l'avanzamento della tecnologia CCD e CMOS, l'analisi dei modelli speckle è diventata sempre più sofisticata, consentendo la rapida acquisizione e elaborazione digitale delle immagini per determinare le variazioni con alta precisione e in tempo reale. In sintesi, la tecnica del laser speckle offre un potente strumento diagnostico e di misurazione in diverse aree della scienza e dell'ingegneria, sfruttando la natura unica delle interferenze ottiche per rivelare dettagli invisibili all'occhio nudo."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

General Overview of Existing Cyber Attacks** The realm of cybersecurity is continually evolving, with cyber attackers becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods to compromise systems, steal sensitive information, and disrupt services. A myriad of cyber attacks exist today, each employing unique strategies and targeting different vulnerabilities within information systems. Understanding the landscape of these attacks is crucial for developing effective defenses and execution mechanisms to detect and prevent them. **Malware-based Attacks**: At the core of numerous cyber attacks is malware — malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Malware comes in various forms, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Each type has unique characteristics and modes of operation. For instance, viruses attach themselves to clean files and proliferate throughout a system, whereas ransomware encrypts victims' files, demanding a ransom for decryption keys. **Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks**: Phishing attacks deceive users into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials and financial data, by masquerading as trustworthy entities in email communications or fraudulent websites. Social engineering tactics further amplify these attacks by exploiting human psychology, tricking individuals into breaking standard security procedures. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**: These attacks aim to overwhelm a system's resources, making it unavailable to intended users. DDoS attacks leverage a network of compromised computers (botnets) to launch a massive assault on the target's infrastructure, drastically amplifying the scale and impact. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: MitM attacks intercept and possibly alter the communication between two parties without their knowledge. Attackers can eavesdrop on exchanges or manipulate the information being transmitted, leading to data breaches or fraud. **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: APTs are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks where attackers infiltrate a network to steal data or monitor activity over an extended period without being detected. These meticulously planned attacks often target high-value targets like government agencies and large corporations. Given the diverse and constantly evolving nature of cyber threats, the detection and prevention of cyber attacks necessitate a comprehensive and adaptive approach. This includes the deployment of sophisticated cybersecurity measures, ongoing monitoring of systems for signs of intrusion, and the employment of execution mechanisms that can effectively neutralize threats before they manifest into full-blown attacks. Moreover, in-depth analysis and understanding of attack methodologies are imperative for anticipating future threats and crafting defenses accordingly."},{"prompt":"Write an entry 1.2 of first chapter of report on theme “Analysis of the sequence of work to detect and prevent cyber attacks using the execute mechanism” using structure: Chapter 1.

Conclusions on the first chapter You can add some useful technical information","completion":"**Chapter 1: Execution Tactics in Malware** **1.2 Methods and Means Used to Carry Out Cyber Attacks** Understanding the methods and means by which cyber attacks are conducted is essential for developing effective countermeasures. Cyber attackers leverage a variety of sophisticated tools and techniques to exploit vulnerabilities, carry out unauthorized actions, and evade detection. **Exploitation of Software Vulnerabilities**: One common method involves exploiting flaws or vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. Attackers write code (exploits) that target specific weaknesses, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or commandeer control of affected systems. These vulnerabilities can range from buffer overflows and SQL injection to zero-day exploits, which are previously unknown vulnerabilities that haven't been patched by the software vendors. **Phishing and Spear Phishing**: Employing deceptive emails and messages, attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. Spear phishing is a more targeted version, where the attacker customizes their approach to fit specific individuals or organizations, increasing the chances of success. **Drive-by Downloads and Malvertising**: Attackers can compromise legitimate websites or ad networks to distribute malware. Unsuspecting users visiting these sites or clicking on these ads may inadvertently download malware onto their devices. Drive-by download attacks exploit vulnerabilities in browsers, plugins, or apps to install malware without any user interaction. **Botnets and Command and Control Servers**: A botnet is a network of infected computers (bots) controlled by an attacker (botmaster). These bots can be used to carry out DDoS attacks, send spam, or perpetrate other malicious activities. Command and control (C&C) servers issue commands to these botnets, receiving stolen data or updating malware without the users' knowledge. **Use of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: APTs involve stealthy, long-term network infiltration by attackers. They often use social engineering, zero-day exploits, and sophisticated malware to gain sustained access to a network, allowing them to exfiltrate data or conduct surveillance over long periods. **Living off the Land (LotL) Attacks**: Attackers use built-in tools and features of the compromised system to conduct their activities, making detection more challenging. This includes using legitimate administrative tools for malicious purposes, also known as \\"living off the land\\" techniques. **Fileless Malware**: Unlike traditional malware, fileless malware resides in the memory and does not install any files on the host's hard drive, making it harder to detect and neutralize using conventional antivirus tools. Given the array of methods and means at the disposal of cyber attackers, protection strategies must be multi-faceted and dynamic. This includes employing up-to-date security solutions, conducting regular system audits and vulnerability assessments, and training employees on the importance of cybersecurity awareness. Furthermore, an effective cyber defense strategy must also incorporate real-time threat detection and execution mechanisms capable of identifying and countering sophisticated attack methods promptly."},{"prompt":"Write the cnn code for image classification using keras.","completion":"Sure, I'll provide you with a simple example of how to write CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) code for image classification using Keras, which is now integrated into TensorFlow 2 as \`tf.keras\`. This example assumes you are familiar with Python and the basics of machine learning. For this example, let's classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. 1. **Import Required Libraries**: First, ensure you have TensorFlow installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip (Python's package installer) by running \`pip install tensorflow\`. \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \`\`\` 2. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is available directly in TensorFlow. \`\`\`python # Load CIFAR-10 data (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data() # Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1 train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0 \`\`\` 3. **Verify the Data**: It's good practice to understand the data you're working with. Let's display the first 25 images from the training set and display the class name below each image. \`\`\`python class_names = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'] plt.figure(figsize=(10,10)) for i in range(25): plt.subplot(5,5,i+1) plt.xticks([]) plt.yticks([]) plt.grid(False) plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary) plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i][0]]) plt.show() \`\`\` 4. **Build the CNN Model**: Here, we define a simple CNN architecture. \`\`\`python model = models.Sequential() model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3))) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')) # Add Dense layers on top model.add(layers.Flatten()) model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(10)) \`\`\` 5. **Compile and Train the Model**: Now compile and train the model using the \`adam\` optimizer. \`\`\`python model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=['accuracy']) history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels)) \`\`\` 6. **Evaluate the Model**: Let's evaluate the model on the test dataset. \`\`\`python test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2) print('nTest accuracy:', test_acc) \`\`\` 7. **Display Training History**: Optionally, you can plot the training and validation accuracy and loss over time, which can help identify overfitting and understand how the model learns. \`\`\`python plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='accuracy') plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label = 'val_accuracy') plt.xlabel('Epoch') plt.ylabel('Accuracy') plt.ylim([0, 1]) plt.legend(loc='lower right') plt.show() \`\`\` This code provides a simple CNN model for image classification. Depending on the complexity of the problem, you might need a more sophisticated model, additional layers, or more data preprocessing. Additionally, consider techniques like data augmentation, dropout, or experimenting with different optimizers and learning rates for improved performance."},{"prompt":"Why use channel size of 32,64,64,64? And all are 2^n ?","completion":"The use of channel sizes such as 32, 64, 64, and similarly using powers of 2 for defining the dimensions in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a common practice in deep learning for several reasons rooted in both computational efficiency and historical conventions: 1. **Computational Efficiency**: Most modern hardware, including CPUs and GPUs, is optimized to handle data in chunks that are powers of 2. This is because computer memory and computation are inherently binary. Operations involving powers of 2 allow these devices to efficiently utilize their memory architecture, leading to possibly faster mathematical operations, better memory alignment, and overall more efficient utilization of the underlying hardware. 2. **Memory Allocation**: When allocating memory, systems can do so more efficiently if the block sizes are powers of 2. This can lead to less wasted space (internal fragmentation) and make it easier for the system to manage memory. 3. **Model Capacity and Complexity**: Doubling the number of filters in deeper layers is a heuristic that balances the trade-off between the computational complexity of the model and its capacity. As you go deeper into the network, the spatial dimensions of the feature maps typically decrease (due to operations like max pooling), but we increase the depth—the number of feature maps—to allow the network to learn more complex features. Starting with smaller numbers of filters and increasing them (often doubling) as the network goes deeper helps in building this complexity gradually, without a sudden spike in computational requirements. 4. **Historical and Empirical Justification**: Many seminal works and successful applications of CNNs have employed layers with sizes that are powers of 2. These architectures have been empirically validated across a myriad of tasks and datasets, proving their effectiveness in practice. As a result, this approach has become a sort of convention or starting point when designing new networks, with the understanding that it often leads to models that perform well. 5. **Parameter Growth and Overfitting**: Doubling the number of channels as the spatial dimensions are reduced helps maintain a balance between the parameter growth and model's capacity to learn hierarchies of features without drastically increasing the risk of overfitting. By carefully increasing the complexity of the model (in a controlled manner, like using powers of 2), it's easier to design networks that generalize well. While using powers of 2 for channel sizes is common and often effective, it is not a strict rule. The architecture of a CNN (including the choice of channel size) ultimately depends on the specific task, the complexity of the data, computational resources available, and empirical performance. Experimenting with different configurations is a crucial part of the model development process in machine learning and deep learning."},{"prompt":"Can I use 64,32,16","completion":"Yes, you can use channel sizes of 64, 32, and 16 in your convolutional neural network (CNN) layers. The choice of number and size of filters (or channels) in each convolutional layer is part of the model design and is highly dependent on the specific task, the complexity of the dataset, and the computational resources at hand. There's a high degree of flexibility in how you design your network architecture. Choosing a descending pattern of channels (e.g., 64, 32, 16) as you mentioned, can have different implications compared to the more commonly seen ascending pattern (e.g., 32, 64, 128). Here are a few considerations: # Reduce Overfitting A model with fewer parameters is less likely to overfit to the training data. By reducing the channel size as you go deeper into the network, you're effectively decreasing the number of learnable parameters. This could be beneficial in scenarios where you have limited data or are concerned about the model's generalization ability. # Computational Efficiency Fewer channels in deeper layers mean fewer computations, leading to faster training and inference times. This could be an advantage in resource-constrained environments or applications where response time is critical. # Information Bottleneck One potential downside is the risk of creating an information bottleneck. As you reduce the number of channels, the capacity of layers to represent complex features might diminish, which could potentially limit model performance, especially if there's a significant amount of complex information to learn from the input data. # Experimentation is Key The effectiveness of any architecture pattern, whether it's ascending, descending, or constant channel sizes, can vary significantly across different tasks and datasets. It often requires empirical experimentation to find the best model configuration for your specific use case. It might be useful to start with a known architecture that performs well on similar tasks or datasets and then iteratively adjust the architecture while monitoring the performance on a validation set. Trying out different configurations like the proposed 64, 32, and 16 channel sizes could reveal interesting insights about your specific problem and how different model capacities affect learning. In summary, while using 64, 32, and 16 channels in descending order is less conventional, it's a perfectly valid approach to experiment with and could have specific benefits depending on your application."},{"prompt":"show the code of add 3x (conv layer, downsampling)","completion":"Certainly! Below is a simple example of how to add three sets of a convolutional layer followed by a downsampling layer (MaxPooling in this case) to a Keras model. This pattern is a common way to design Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for tasks like image classification. In this example, we use TensorFlow's Keras API to build the model. Each convolutional layer will be followed by a max pooling layer to reduce the spatial size of the representation, which helps reduce the amount of computation and parameters in the network, potentially alleviating overfitting. Please ensure you have TensorFlow installed in your environment (\`pip install tensorflow\`). \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import layers, models # Define the input shape (e.g., for CIFAR-10) input_shape = (32, 32, 3) # Change this as per your dataset model = models.Sequential() # First convolutional block model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=input_shape)) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Second convolutional block model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Third convolutional block model.add(layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Add final layers for classification model.add(layers.Flatten()) model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(10)) # Assuming 10 classes for the output layer model.summary() \`\`\` Explanation: - **Conv2D**: Adds a convolutional layer. The first parameter (e.g., 64, 32, 16) specifies the number of filters. \`(3, 3)\` specifies the size of each filter. \`activation='relu'\` specifies the Rectified Linear Unit activation function, and \`padding='same'\` means the output will have the same spatial dimensions as the input by adding padding as necessary. - **MaxPooling2D**: Adds a pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions (height, width) of the input volume. \`(2, 2)\` specifies the size of the pooling window. - **Flatten**: Flattens the input. Does not affect the batch size. - **Dense**: Adds densely connected (fully connected) layers. The first one has 64 units and uses ReLU activation. The final Dense layer should have as many units as there are classes; in this hypothetical case, 10 classes are assumed. This example forms a simple CNN architecture, which you might need to adjust depending on your specific task, such as changing the input shape, the number of output classes, or the depth and width of the network."},{"prompt":"show the code of a 20 layers cnn.","completion":"Designing a 20-layer CNN from scratch using Keras is quite straightforward, but it's crucial to consider how deep you make your network and the size of your data. Very deep networks might suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, making them hard to train without careful architecture considerations like normalization layers and skip connections, as seen in ResNet architectures. For illustrative purposes, I'll show a simple example of creating a 20-layer CNN using Keras. This network won't include advanced techniques such as residual blocks, which are generally recommended for very deep networks. However, I’ll include some batch normalization layers which can help in training deeper networks by normalizing the activations. For a complex deep network to be effective, especially one with 20 layers, more sophisticated designs like ResNet, DenseNet, or others are advisable. The example below is primarily educational, to demonstrate how one might sequentially add layers in Keras. \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import layers, models model = models.Sequential() # Input layer model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(32, 32, 3))) # Adding convolutional layers with some pattern, e.g., doubling the number of filters every few layers filters = 32 for _ in range(6): model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.BatchNormalization()) # Adding BatchNormalization to help with training model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) filters *= 2 # Increasing filters # Reducing filters towards the end, example pattern for _ in range(2): filters //= 4 model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.BatchNormalization()) # Flatten before passing to the Dense layers model.add(layers.Flatten()) # Fully connected layers model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')) # Example for a 10-class classification model.summary() \`\`\` In this example: - The network starts with a convolutional layer with 32 filters of size (3x3). - It sequentially adds convolutional layers, doubling the number of filters every few layers to increase the network's capacity. - Adding Batch Normalization layers after activation functions to stabilize learning by normalizing the input layer by adjusting and scaling the activations. - Uses MaxPooling to reduce dimensions periodically. - Towards the end, it reduces the number of filters again (this is more for illustration; typically, you might continue increasing or keep it constant depending on the problem). - Finally, it flattens the output and adds a couple of fully connected layers for classification. This is just a simple demonstration of constructing a deep CNN with Keras. For serious applications, especially with such depth, you would likely adopt or adapt an existing architecture optimized for such depths, like ResNet, which introduces skip connections to help with the training of very deep networks."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I'll try to provide a helpful answer by interpreting your question in a context that makes sense. The terms \\"Charlie up down EC functions\\" don't directly correspond to well-known concepts or terminologies in physics or chemistry as of my last update. However, it sounds like you might be referring to some of the fundamental aspects of atomic structure and behavior, particularly electron configuration (which could be what \\"EC\\" stands for) and possibly something related to spin states (\\"up down\\"). Let's clarify these concepts: # Electron Configuration (EC) - **Electron Configuration** is a description of the distribution of an atom's electrons in its atomic orbitals. It is typically represented by notations that indicate the energy levels, subshells, and the number of electrons in those subshells. For example, the electron configuration of oxygen is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴, which means it has two electrons in its 1s subshell, two in the 2s subshell, and four in the 2p subshell. # Spin States (\\"Up Down\\") - **Spin** is a fundamental property of particles such as electrons. Each electron has a quantum mechanical property called spin, which can have one of two possible orientations: spin-up or spin-down. This concept is crucial in quantum mechanics and in explaining the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. Therefore, in an orbital where two electrons are present, one must be spin-up and the other spin-down. # Atomic Structure and Quantum Mechanics - Atoms consist of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in various orbitals. The Quantum Mechanical Model of the atom, which includes the work of scientists such as Schrödinger and Heisenberg, provides a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position around the nucleus. - **Quantum Numbers** describe properties of atomic orbitals and the electrons in those orbitals. These include: - Principal quantum number (n): Indicates the energy level. - Angular momentum quantum number (l): Indicates the shape of the orbital. - Magnetic quantum number (ml): Indicates the orientation of the orbital. - Spin quantum number (ms): Indicates the spin orientation (up or down). If you were asking about something more specific or had a different concept in mind related to the unclear terms \\"Charlie up down,\\" please provide additional context or details. Physics and chemistry are vast fields, and precise terminology can help in delivering the most accurate and helpful explanations."},{"prompt":"write a song about it make it scientific and not romantic,","completion":"(Verse 1) In the heart of an atom, where the nucleus lies, Protons and neutrons, under quantum skies.

It is a transformer-based model architecture designed to unify and simplify the processing pipeline for segmenting individual objects within an image. Unlike traditional approaches that handle instance segmentation by detecting objects first and then segmenting each detected object, MaskFormer directly predicts a set of binary masks, each associated with a global, per-mask class label. This architecture allows MaskFormer to seamlessly address semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with a single, coherent model pipeline. # MaskFormer Architecture: 1. **Backbone:** The backbone of MaskFormer is a convolutional network used for initial feature extraction from the input images. This can be any standard CNN architecture like ResNet, or more advanced ones like Swin Transformers that have shown promising results in various computer vision tasks. 2. **Transformer Encoder-Decoder:** On top of the backbone, MaskFormer employs a transformer encoder-decoder structure. The encoder processes the feature maps from the backbone to produce a high-level representation of the input image. The decoder then takes this representation and outputs a set of mask tokens. Each mask token is designed to capture the spatial information for a particular segment in the image. 3. **Pixel Decoder:** In addition to the transformer architecture, a pixel decoder takes the high-level features from the transformer and potentially the backbone and refines them to produce per-pixel predictions. This helps in refining the mask boundaries and improving the segmentation quality. 4. **Classification Head:** For each mask token, there is an associated classification head that predicts the class label for the mask. This allows the model to not only segment the image into different parts but also understand what each part represents. 5. **Bipartite Matching and Loss Calculation:** Training involves a bipartite matching step where each predicted mask is matched with a ground truth mask to calculate the loss. The loss function is a combination of a mask loss (such as dice loss or focal loss) and a classification loss (such as cross-entropy), alongside any additional regularization terms. This ensures that the model learns to accurately segment the image while correctly classifying each segment. # Hyperparameters and Performance Improvement: To improve the performance of a MaskFormer model for instance segmentation, you can adjust several hyperparameters: 1. **Learning Rate and Scheduler:** The learning rate and its schedule are critical for training stability and performance. Consider using learning rate warm-up and step decay, or more advanced schedulers like cosine annealing. 2. **Number of Transformer Layers:** Adjusting the depth of both the encoder and decoder can impact the model's ability to learn complex patterns. 3. **Transformer Attention Heads and Dimensions:** The number of attention heads and the dimensionality of the transformer layers can be tuned for a balance between model capacity and computational efficiency. 4. **Backbone Architecture:** Switching between different backbone architectures can significantly affect performance. More advanced or deeper backbones might capture richer features, beneficial for complex segmentation tasks. 5. **Data Augmentation:** Advanced data augmentation techniques can improve model robustness and generalization. 6. **Regularization:** Techniques like weight decay, dropout in the transformer, and other forms of regularization can help prevent overfitting. 7. **Batch Size:** Larger batch sizes can provide more stable gradient estimates, but watch out for the trade-off with learning rate and regularization. 8. **Loss Function Weights:** Tuning the balance between the mask loss and the classification loss can help if the model is struggling more with one task compared to the other. By carefully adjusting these hyperparameters and continuously evaluating the model's performance on a validation set, you can iteratively improve your MaskFormer model's instance segmentation capabilities. Remember to track experiments meticulously to understand the impact of each change and use a systematic approach like grid search or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning."},{"prompt":"can you give code for hyper parameters fine tuning and how can i use hyper parameter search API of hugging to find there optimal value for all hyper parameters","completion":"Fine-tuning hyperparameters efficiently is a critical process in developing machine learning models, including complex architectures like MaskFormer for instance segmentation tasks.

This is crucial for Hugging Face's \`Trainer\` to re-initialize the model with different hyperparameters during the search. - **\`hp_space\`:** A function that defines the hyperparameter search space. The example above uses \`suggest_*\` methods to define ranges for different hyperparameters. - **\`backend=\\"optuna\\"\`:** Specifies Optuna as the backend for hyperparameter optimization (HPO). You can also use \`\\"ray\\"\` if you're using Ray Tune. # Note - Replace \`\\"your_dataset\\"\` with your actual dataset and adjust the model type and configuration as per your needs. - You might need to implement a \`compute_metrics\` function based on the metrics relevant to your task for evaluation. - Ensure you have the necessary computational resources, as HPO can be resource-intensive. By adjusting this setup to your specific use case, you can efficiently find optimal hyperparameters for your MaskFormer instance segmentation tasks or any other models you're working with."},{"prompt":"can you give hyper parameter code for Maskformer model","completion":"As of my last update, direct code examples specific to hyperparameter tuning for a MaskFormer model using a specific library like Hugging Face or Detectron2 were not readily available in popular documentation. MaskFormer, being a cutting-edge approach for segmentation tasks, involves complex architectures and training procedures, particularly because it merges transformers with segmentation tasks which are traditionally handled by CNN-based architectures. However, I will guide you through a general approach to setting up hyperparameter tuning for a segmentation task, akin to what you'd do for a model like MaskFormer. For the sake of this example, let's assume we are working with a PyTorch implementation of MaskFormer or a similar model for which you have training code available. We'll use \`ray[tune]\` for hyperparameter optimization, a powerful yet intuitive tool: # Step 1: Define Your Training Function First, wrap your training procedure in a function that accepts hyperparameters as arguments. This function should handle the training and validation of your model and report the performance back to Ray Tune. \`\`\`python import torch from ray import tune from detectron2.config import get_cfg from detectron2.engine import DefaultTrainer def train_maskformer(config): # Assuming you have a configuration function to set the defaults cfg = get_cfg() cfg.merge_from_file(\\"path/to/maskformer/config.yaml\\") # Example hyperparameters you might want to tune cfg.SOLVER.BASE_LR = config[\\"lr\\"] cfg.SOLVER.MAX_ITER = config[\\"max_iter\\"] cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.BATCH_SIZE_PER_IMAGE = config[\\"roi_batch_size\\"] # Assuming we use Detectron2's DefaultTrainer, adapt if you have a custom trainer trainer = DefaultTrainer(cfg) trainer.resume_or_load(resume=False) trainer.train() # Here you should implement evaluation and report the metrics to Ray Tune # For simplicity, let's assume a metric \\"val_loss\\" is returned by your eval function val_loss = eval_model(cfg) tune.report(loss=val_loss) \`\`\` # Step 2: Configure Ray Tune and Start the Experiment \`\`\`python from ray.tune.schedulers import ASHAScheduler # Define the search space for your hyperparameters search_space = { \\"lr\\": tune.loguniform(1e-6, 1e-3), \\"max_iter\\": tune.choice([10000, 20000, 30000]), \\"roi_batch_size\\": tune.choice([32, 64, 128]) } # Define a scheduler and how many samples to run scheduler = ASHAScheduler(metric=\\"loss\\", mode=\\"min\\") num_samples = 10 # Start the hyperparameter search analysis = tune.run( train_maskformer, config=search_space, num_samples=num_samples, scheduler=scheduler, resources_per_trial={\\"cpu\\": 4, \\"gpu\\": 1} # Adjust based on your hardware ) # Fetch the best hyperparameters best_config = analysis.get_best_config(metric=\\"loss\\", mode=\\"min\\") print(\\"Best config: \\", best_config) \`\`\` # Notes: - Replace \`\\"path/to/maskformer/config.yaml\\"\` with the path to your configuration file matching the architecture and dataset specifics for the MaskFormer setup. - This example assumes a certain level of familiarity with Detectron2's \`DefaultTrainer\`. Adjustments would be necessary if you're using a different training loop/setup or different hyperparameters to tune. This is particularly because MaskFormer might have additional or different sets of hyperparameters to consider, based on the architecture used (e.g., transformer encoder-decoder specifics, backbone choice, etc.). - \`eval_model()\` is a placeholder for your model evaluation function, which you need to implement according to how your validation data and metrics are set up. Remember, the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning will largely depend on properly defining the search space, the computational resources available, and the meaningfulness of the metrics used for evaluation. While this example might not hit every detail of configuring and tuning a complex model like MaskFormer, it provides a foundational framework that you can expand upon."},{"prompt":"what is swin model","completion":"The Swin Transformer, introduced in a paper by Ze Liu et al. in 2021 titled \\"Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows,\\" represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, particularly in how transformers are applied to vision tasks. The model is designed to serve as a versatile backbone for a variety of vision applications, including but not limited to image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The innovation of the Swin Transformer lies in its ability to efficiently scale to process high-resolution images, making it highly effective and competitive with state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) while maintaining the advantages of the transformer architecture. # Key Features of Swin Transformer: 1. **Shifted Window Approach:** Swin Transformer introduces a novel mechanism that partitions images into non-overlapping windows and then applies self-attention within each window. To facilitate cross-window connection and mitigate the limitation of window-based self-attention (which doesn't allow for interaction across window borders), it shifts the window partition between consecutive self-attention layers. This shift enables cross-window connectivity and allows for a hierarchical representation that resembles CNNs, ensuring efficient information flow across the entire image. 2. **Hierarchical Representation:** The model generates hierarchical feature maps by progressively merging neighboring windows, reducing the resolution while increasing the feature dimension. This structure is beneficial for various vision tasks that require understanding at multiple scales, akin to CNNs that employ pooling layers or strided convolutions. 3. **Computational Efficiency:** By limiting self-attention computation to within small windows and using the shifted window approach, Swin Transformers significantly reduce the computational complexity of processing high-resolution images. Unlike global self-attention mechanisms, whose computational costs grow quadratically with the increase in image size, the localized window-based approach makes it feasible to handle larger images. 4. **Versatility:** Swin Transformer is designed to be a general-purpose backbone for computer vision, proving effective across a range of tasks including but not limited to image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Its design allows it to be easily plugged into existing frameworks that were initially developed for CNNs. # Swin Transformer vs. Traditional Transformers in Vision: Traditional vision transformers, like the original Vision Transformer (ViT) model, apply self-attention globally across image patches, making them computationally expensive for large images and less efficient at capturing local spatial hierarchies. Swin Transformer addresses these issues by employing localized, window-based self-attention and introducing a hierarchical structure, making it more suitable and efficient for a broader range of image resolutions and vision tasks. The Swin Transformer’s introduction of a hierarchical, efficient, and flexible architecture has sparked considerable interest and further research into transformer models for computer vision, leading to its adoption in various cutting-edge applications and serving as a foundation for subsequent innovations in the field."},{"prompt":"what is the base architecture of YoloV8 model","completion":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, YOLOv8 has not been officially announced or described in academic literature or major repositories. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) series of models, developed for object detection tasks, has seen several iterations, with YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 being among the most popular and widely used in the community. # YOLO Series Overview The YOLO models are known for their fast detection speeds and relatively high accuracy, making them suitable for real-time applications. They treat object detection as a single regression problem, directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single forward pass through the network, which differs from other approaches that might use separate stages for these tasks. 1. **YOLOv4**, introduced by Alexey Bochkovskiy, focused on improving both the speed and accuracy of detection through various architectural and methodological improvements, including the use of CSPDarknet53 as a backbone, spatial pyramid pooling, and path aggregation. 2. **YOLOv5**, developed by Ultralytics, continued to refine the YOLO approach, though it sparked some controversy over version numbering and official releases. YOLOv5 features several architectural improvements, including the use of PyTorch for implementation, model scalability (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x), and enhancements in training methodology, efficiency, and speed. # Theoretical Base Architecture of a Hypothetical YOLOv8 While YOLOv8 has not been described as of my last update, we can speculate on potential improvements and features that such a future iteration might include based on the evolution of the YOLO series and trends in deep learning: 1. **Advanced Backbone Architectures**: Incorporation of newer, more efficient architectures such as Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformer) or next-generation CNNs designed for higher accuracy and speed with lower computational requirements. 2. **Enhanced Data Augmentation and Training Strategies**: Utilization of state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques and more refined training procedures to improve model generalization and robustness across varied datasets and conditions. 3. **AutoML and Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: Leveraging AutoML and NAS to optimize network architecture, hyperparameters, and possibly the training pipeline itself for better performance and efficiency. 4. **Attention Mechanisms**: Integrating sophisticated attention mechanisms to improve the model's focus on relevant features within the image, enhancing detection accuracy, especially for small or occluded objects. 5. **Multi-Scale Features and Fusion**: Further improvements in handling multi-scale features more effectively, potentially through more advanced feature pyramid networks (FPNs) or novel fusion techniques that enhance the model's ability to detect objects of various sizes. 6. **Efficiency Improvements**: Focus on model efficiency, aiming at smaller model sizes, faster inference times, and reduced power consumption to facilitate deployment on edge devices and mobile platforms. 7. **Cross-Task Abilities**: Expansion of capabilities to not just object detection but also instance segmentation, pose estimation, or tracking, making the model more versatile for different vision tasks. It’s essential to stay updated with the official repositories, preprint servers like arXiv, or conferences to get the latest information on developments like YOLOv8.

Vous devez vous assurer que ces composants sont importés avant de pouvoir les utiliser. **Correction:** Assurez-vous d'importer \`TodoItem\` et \`Titre\` en haut de votre script \`App.vue\` comme ceci : \`\`\`js import TodoItem from './components/TodoItem.vue' import Titre from './components/Titre.vue' \`\`\` Remarque : Ajustez les chemins en fonction de l'endroit où vous avez stocké ces fichiers. # Problème 2: Plusieurs Balises \`<template>\` dans un Seul Fichier .vue Vous avez inclus plusieurs balises \`<template>\` dans le même fichier de composant Vue. Un fichier \`.vue\` devrait contenir une seule balise \`<template>\` qui englobe tout le HTML du composant. Si vous avez plusieurs fichiers de composants (ce qui est recommandé pour une structure propre), chaque composant devrait être dans son propre fichier \`.vue\` avec sa propre balise \`<template>\`. **Correction:** Assurez-vous que chaque composant est dans son propre fichier \`.vue\` avec une seule balise \`<template>\` et un script associé. Par exemple, vous devriez avoir un fichier \`Titre.vue\` pour le composant \`titre\` et un fichier \`TodoItem.vue\` pour le composant \`todo-item\`. # Problème 3: Problèmes de Cases (Majuscules/Minuscules) dans les Noms de Composants Vue.js utilise la convention \`kebab-case\` pour les noms de composants dans les templates et \`PascalCase\` pour les déclarations dans le script JS. Si vous ne suivez pas ces conventions, Vue pourrait ne pas être capable de faire correspondre les composants avec leurs tags dans le template. **Correction:** **Dans le template :** \`\`\`html <titre :texte=\\"texte\\"></titre> <todo-item v-for=\\"todo in todos\\" :key=\\"todo.text\\" :ma-tache=\\"todo\\"></todo-item> \`\`\` **Dans le script :** \`\`\`js components: { TodoItem, Titre } \`\`\` Vérifiez les noms de fichiers et les importations pour les cas de divergence. # Problème 4: Placement Incorrect du Code Votre question semble inclure du code \`<template>\` et \`<script>\` dispersé, ce qui suggère une confusion sur la manière de structurer les composants Vue. Chaque fichier de composant (\`*.vue\`) doit avoir une structure claire : une balise \`<template>\` pour le HTML, une balise \`<script>\` pour la logique JavaScript, et éventuellement une balise \`<style>\` pour le CSS. **Correction:** Assurez-vous que chaque composant (p. ex., \`App\`, \`TodoItem\`, \`Titre\`) est correctement organisé dans son propre fichier \`.vue\` avec une claire séparation des concerns. # Résumé Après avoir apporté ces corrections, vérifiez également de ne pas avoir de problèmes dans la console de développement du navigateur, car elle peut vous donner des indices sur d'autres erreurs potentielles.

Since client scripts run on the client side (the user's browser), they can't directly access the server-side \`GlideRecord\` API you used in your server-side script. However, you can use a GlideAjax call to execute server-side code from the client script and return the information you need. Here's a breakdown of how to achieve your goal: 1. **Write a Script Include**: This will contain the server-side logic to check if there are any operational virtual servers based on the IP address provided. It will be callable from your client script using GlideAjax. 2. **Create an OnChange Client Script**: This will trigger whenever the \\"Select Server\\" field value changes. It will use GlideAjax to call the Script Include and process the response to show an alert and clear the value if necessary. # Step 1: Script Include First, create a Script Include that’s accessible by client scripts. **Name**: \`CheckOperationalServers\` **Client Callable**: Checked (True) **Script**: \`\`\`javascript var CheckOperationalServers = Class.create(); CheckOperationalServers.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { isServerOperational: function() { var ipAddress = this.getParameter('ip_address'); // Get the IP address passed from the client script var relGlide = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); var queryString = \\"type=d93304fb0a0a0b78006081a72ef08444^child.ip_address=\\" + ipAddress; relGlide.addEncodedQuery(queryString); relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()) { if (relGlide.parent.operational_status == 1) { return \\"true\\"; // Return \\"true\\" as a string to indicate an operational server exists } } return \\"false\\"; // Return \\"false\\" if no operational servers are found } }); \`\`\` # Step 2: OnChange Client Script Next, create an OnChange client script for the \\"Select Server\\" field. **Name**: Whatever descriptive name you prefer **Table**: The table where your catalog form resides **Field name**: The exact field name of your \\"Select Server\\" field **Type**: OnChange **Script**: \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue == '') { return; } var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckOperationalServers'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'isServerOperational'); ga.addParam('ip_address', newValue); // Assuming newValue holds the IP address. Adjust accordingly. ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer) { if (answer == 'true') { alert('An operational virtual server exists for this IP address. Please select a different server.'); g_form.clearValue('select_server_field_name'); // Replace 'select_server_field_name' with the exact field name } }); } \`\`\` Remember to replace \`'select_server_field_name'\` with the actual field name of the \\"Select Server\\" field and adjust the ‘ip_address’ parameter as needed based on how your catalog item passes the IP address (it might require custom logic based on your catalog item setup). This setup will alert the user if any selected server is operational and clear the selection, providing the intended functionality."},{"prompt":"when a particular server is selected, a script should run to check if any operational virtual servers are tagged to the current physical server being decommisioned. if operational virtual servers are found, a popup message should be displayed to the requester which will contain operational VM servers IP and should clear physical server mandatory variable","completion":"To implement the scenario where you want to check for operational virtual servers tagged to the current physical server being decommissioned, and then inform the requester if any are found through a pop-up message displaying their IP addresses, involves a few modifications. The general approach remains similar: utilizing a combination of a **Script Include** for server-side logic and an **OnChange Client Script** for the client-side interface. Here we refine the implementation details, particularly focusing on handling multiple IPs and providing a clear user feedback mechanism. # Step 1: Script Include Modification Enhance the \`Script Include\` to return the IP addresses of operational virtual servers. **Script Include Example:** \`\`\`javascript var CheckOperationalServers = Class.create(); CheckOperationalServers.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { getOperationalServerIPs: function() { var serverSysId = this.getParameter('server_sys_id'); // Retrieve the server's sys_id var operationalIPs = []; var relGlide = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); relGlide.addQuery('parent', serverSysId); // Assuming parent represents the physical server relGlide.addQuery('child.operational_status', '1'); // Looking for operational VMs relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()) { var ip = relGlide.child.ip_address; // Adjust based on your CMDB structure if (ip) operationalIPs.push(ip.toString()); } return operationalIPs.join(','); // Return a comma-separated list of IPs } }); \`\`\` Ensure to adjust field references based on your data model if they differ. # Step 2: OnChange Client Script Adjustment Modify the client script to handle the dynamic feedback based on the Script Include's response. **OnChange Client Script Example:** \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue == '') { return; } var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckOperationalServers'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getOperationalServerIPs'); ga.addParam('server_sys_id', newValue); // Assuming newValue holds the server's sys_id. Adjust if it's different. ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer) { if (answer) { var message = \\"Decommissioning is blocked due to operational VMs tagged to this server. Please review the following IP(s): \\" + answer; alert(message); g_form.clearValue('your_physical_server_field_name'); // Replace with your field name } }); } \`\`\` Replace \`'your_physical_server_field_name'\` with the actual field name of your \\"Select Server\\" (physical server selection) variable. # Points to Note 1. **Data Model**: The implementation above assumes a particular data model (e.g., relationships in \`cmdb_rel_ci\` and fields like \`operational_status\` and \`ip_address\`). You may need to adjust field names based on your configuration. 2. **Performance Considerations**: Depending on the size of your CMDB and the number of relationships, querying large datasets might impact performance. Consider optimizing your queries or including safeguards to maintain system responsiveness. 3. **Security**: Always review and test any script for potential security implications, especially when exposing information like IP addresses. This approach should meet your requirements by alerting the user about operational VMs tied to a selected physical server, including showing the relevant IP addresses and enforcing data cleanliness by clearing the selection if the condition is met."},{"prompt":"现在有一个场景描述如下，app上有一个推荐feed，feed中包含许多播放器卡片，滑动到某个卡片就会自动播放。现在存在一个问题描述如下：当我们滑动到某一个卡片的时候，我们可能进入如下操作；1.点击进入横屏播放 2.点击进入详情页播放 3.点击进入相关推荐feed进行播放，现在每个操作发生后都会新创建一个播放器卡片来播放，但是数据是一样的。现在我们希望设计一个共享的context保证用户在进入不同的场景消费之后回到最初的推荐feed状态和数据都能够保持一致，例如用户进入横屏之后，在横屏卡片上登陆或者打开音频播放，我们希望回到feed也能保持这个状态，例如我们进入详情页支付成功后触发数据刷新，我们希望回到feed也是支付成功后的新数据，该如何设计这个共享context，保证其优雅性和扩展性，使用kotlin写一个比较详细的demo","completion":"为了设计一个既优雅又具有扩展性的共享\`Context\`来解决你描述的场景问题，我们可以采用观察者模式与单例模式的结合实践。在此基础上，利用Kotlin的高级特性，比如对象声明（Object Declaration）、密封类（Sealed Class）以及扩展函数（Extension Functions），可以为这个共享\`Context\`提供一个灵活而强大的实现。 在你所描述的应用场景中，\`FeedPlayerContext\`（我们将这个共享\`Context\`命名为\`FeedPlayerContext\`）中不仅需要管理播放器的状态（如播放、暂停、播放进度等），还需要负责数据的同步更新，如在不同场景下订阅的数据变化。 以下是一个简化的实现方案： # 1. 定义播放器状态和事件 考虑到播放器可能有多种状态和事件（如播放、暂停、加载新内容等），我们可以使用一个密封类来对这些可能的状态和事件进行建模。 \`\`\`kotlin sealed class PlayerEvent { object Play : PlayerEvent() object Pause : PlayerEvent() data class LoadContent(val contentId: String) : PlayerEvent() data class UpdateProgress(val progress: Int) : PlayerEvent() // 根据需求添加其他事件 } \`\`\` # 2. 定义共享Context 该\`Context\`负责管理播放状态和数据，以及播放相关事件的订阅与通知。 \`\`\`kotlin object FeedPlayerContext { private val observers = mutableListOf<(PlayerEvent) -> Unit>() private var currentPlayerEvent: PlayerEvent? = null fun subscribe(observer: (PlayerEvent) -> Unit) { observers.add(observer) currentPlayerEvent?.let { observer(it) } // 向新订阅者发送当前状态 } fun unsubscribe(observer: (PlayerEvent) -> Unit) { observers.remove(observer) } fun notifyPlayerEvent(event: PlayerEvent) { currentPlayerEvent = event observers.forEach { it(event) } } } \`\`\` # 3. 使用共享Context 现在，无论用户进入哪一个场景（横屏播放、详情页播放、相关推荐feed播放），都可以通过\`FeedPlayerContext\`来管理和通知播放器的状态。 \`\`\`kotlin // 假设有一个横屏播放的函数 fun enterFullScreen() { // 其他逻辑... // 通知播放器状态改变 FeedPlayerContext.notifyPlayerEvent(PlayerEvent.Play) } // 在初始化或适当的地方订阅播放器事件 FeedPlayerContext.subscribe { event -> when (event) { is PlayerEvent.Play -> println(\\"播放器播放\\") is PlayerEvent.Pause -> println(\\"播放器暂停\\") is PlayerEvent.LoadContent -> println(\\"加载内容 ID: {event.contentId}\\") is PlayerEvent.UpdateProgress -> println(\\"更新进度至 {event.progress}%\\") // 处理其他事件 } } // 不要忘记在不再需要接收事件的地方取消订阅 FeedPlayerContext.unsubscribe(/* 传入之前订阅时的 lambda 引用 */) \`\`\` # 4. 关于扩展性和优雅性 - **扩展性**：该设计方案利用了密封类和观察者模式，使得新增或修改播放器事件变得相对简单。你只需要在\`PlayerEvent\`密封类中添加或修改相应的事件即可，而使用\`FeedPlayerContext\`的地方无需做出任何修改。 - **优雅性**：通过单例模式（Kotlin的\`object\`声明）实现的\`FeedPlayerContext\`，不需要手工管理其生命周期或担心多实例问题，同时，Kotlin语法的简洁性使得代码易于理解和维护。 这个解决方案不仅适用于你描述的视频播放场景，也可以适用于其他需要在多个组件间共享状态和事件的场景。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Smith affirme que le travail bien fait offre une satisfaction intérieure à l'individu, qui se sent ainsi utile et contribuant à la société. 2. Le travail comme moyen de réalisation de soi : Erich Fromm développe cette fonction du travail en mettant en lumière le potentiel qu'a le travail de permettre à l'individu de se réaliser et de s'épanouir. Selon Fromm, le travail peut être une source d'accomplissement personnel en permettant à l'individu d'exprimer ses talents et ses capacités. 3. Le travail comme moyen d'échange : Karl Marx met en avant cette fonction du travail en soulignant que le travail est avant tout une forme d'échange économique. Pour Marx, l'individu vend sa force de travail contre un salaire, ce qui crée une relation de travail basée sur l'échange monétaire et la production de biens et services. 4. Le travail comme moyen de pouvoir et de domination : Michel Foucault explore cette fonction du travail en soulignant que le travail peut être un outil de contrôle et de domination sociale. Selon Foucault, les structures de pouvoir utilisent le travail pour discipliner les individus, les soumettre à des normes et les maintenir dans un certain ordre social. 5. Le travail comme reproduction des inégalités sociales : Pierre Bourdieu met en avant cette fonction du travail en montrant comment le système de travail peut contribuer à la reproduction des inégalités sociales.

What frame should I take for the mission?","completion":"Choosing the right Warframe for a mobile defense mission against Corpus enemies in the level 35-40 range involves considering a few key factors: crowd control, area defense, and survivability. Here are several Warframes that excel in these areas, making them excellent choices for the task: 1. **Frost**: Frost is a classic choice for any defense or mobile defense mission. His Snow Globe ability provides excellent protection for the defense target, absorbing incoming damage and slowing enemies that enter it. It's particularly effective against projectile-based attacks, which are common among the Corpus. 2. **Limbo**: Limbo's ability to manipulate the Rift Plane makes him uniquely suited for mobile defense missions. By casting Cataclysm around the defense terminal and then using Stasis, Limbo can freeze all enemies that enter the Rift, effectively neutralizing threats while keeping the terminal safe. However, be mindful of your teammates, as Limbo's abilities can sometimes interfere with their gameplay if not coordinated properly. 3. **Mesa**: Mesa's Peacemaker ability allows her to lock down and quickly eliminate enemies from a distance, making her a great choice for protecting the objective. Her Shatter Shield also provides a significant damage reduction against ranged attacks, adding to her survivability. 4. **Gara**: Gara can create a durable barrier around the objective using her Mass Vitrify ability, which turns incoming enemies into glass and makes them vulnerable to additional damage. She also has good damage potential and survivability thanks to her Splinter Storm. 5. **Volt**: Volt's Electric Shield can provide both defensive and offensive benefits, stopping incoming fire while enhancing the damage of outgoing shots that pass through the shield. This can be particularly effective in a mobile defense mission where positioning and area denial play crucial roles. 6. **Nova**: With her Molecular Prime ability, Nova can slow down approaching enemies significantly, making them easier to manage and increasing the damage they take. This ability is also excellent for crowd control, as enemies that die while under its effect will explode and damage nearby foes. Each of these Warframes can bring tremendous value to a Corpus mobile defense mission, though your choice may also depend on your personal playstyle, the composition of your squad (if you're playing in co-op), and whether you've modified any Warframe with Forma to enhance its abilities further. Remember, communication and coordination with your team can dramatically affect the outcome of the mission, regardless of which Warframe you choose."},{"prompt":"Alright, I'll take frost prime. What primary weapon should I bring?","completion":"Taking Frost Prime to a Corpus Mobile Defense mission is a solid choice given his ability to protect objectives with his Snow Globe. When it comes to choosing a primary weapon to complement Frost Prime for a level 35-40 Corpus mission, consider weapons that are effective against Corpus shields and provide either crowd control or high single-target damage. Here are some options you might find suitable, keeping in mind the effectiveness against shields and the crowd control potential: 1. **Ignis Wraith**: This flamethrower offers a high rate of fire and the ability to hit multiple targets simultaneously, making it excellent for crowd control. It deals Heat damage, which can be effective against Corpus flesh once their shields are down. Modding it with Magnetic damage (Electricity + Cold) can also make it more effective at quickly taking down shields. 2. **Arca Plasmor**: A Corpus shotgun with innate Radiation damage, the Arca Plasmor fires blasts of plasma energy that can hit multiple enemies in a wide arc. It's particularly effective against Corpus due to its innate damage type being strong against both shields and robotics, which are prevalent in Corpus units. 3. **Amprex**: The Amprex is an electricity-based beam weapon that chains between multiple targets, making it superb for crowd control. Modding it for Magnetic damage can make it highly effective against Corpus shields, while its innate chaining ability ensures it can handle groups of enemies efficiently. 4. **Hema**: If you're looking for something unconventional, the Hema is a burst-fire Infested rifle that heals you for a percentage of the damage dealt. While its base damage is Viral, which isn't particularly effective against shields, it can be modded for Magnetic damage to better counter Corpus defenses. Its self-healing ability can enhance your sustainability on the field. 5. **Rubico Prime**: For those who prefer precision shooting, Rubico Prime is a powerful sniper rifle capable of dealing massive critical damage. While traditionally seen as more of a boss or heavy unit killer, its high damage output means it can quickly eliminate priority targets, like Corpus Techs or Bursas, that might threaten the defense objective. When choosing your primary weapon for this mission, consider the mods at your disposal, as modding correctly can significantly alter a weapon's effectiveness against certain enemies. For dealing with Corpus, modding for Magnetic damage (combining Electricity and Cold mods) is often recommended to strip shields more efficiently. Additionally, consider any utility or crowd control mods you have that can complement your weapon's base capabilities. Remember, the right choice also depends on your playstyle, the specific challenges of the mission, and what you find fun to play with. Warframe is about experimentation and finding what works best for you in various situations."},{"prompt":"I'll take amprex, I'll mod it for magnetic and heat damage. I'll add base damage and multi shot mods, critical chance and critical damage, beam length and punch thru, and and fire rate.","completion":"Modding your Amprex for Magnetic and Heat damage, along with focusing on base damage, multi-shot, critical chance, critical damage, beam length, punch-through, and fire rate is an excellent strategy for optimizing its effectiveness in a level 35-40 Corpus mobile defense mission with Frost Prime. Here’s a breakdown of how this mod setup could look, assuming you have access to typical mods and are working towards an optimized build: 1. **Serration** - Increases base damage, essential for any primary weapon build. 2. **Split Chamber** - Adds a chance for multi-shot, effectively doubling your damage output when it triggers. 3. **Point Strike** - Significantly increases critical chance, essential given the Amprex's high critical potential. 4. **Vital Sense** - Increases critical damage, synergizing well with the Amprex's ability to land frequent critical hits. 5. **Heavy Caliber** (optional for increased damage, with some loss of accuracy) or a Riven mod tailored to your playstyle can also be considered here if you're willing to trade off precision for raw power. 6. **Stormbringer** and **Cryo Rounds** for combining into Magnetic damage, targeting the Corpus’ shield weaknesses effectively. 7. **Hellfire** or **Thermite Rounds** (if you want to add status chance as well) for Heat damage, which is good against flesh and can cause the Panic status effect on enemies. 8. **Sinister Reach** to increase the beam length, allowing you to engage enemies from a safer distance and making it easier to sweep rooms. 9. **Shred** or **Primed Shred** (if you have access to it) - This adds punch-through and increases fire rate, letting your beams pass through multiple enemies and eliminating them more quickly. This setup focuses on turning the Amprex into a room-clearing powerhouse, capable of quickly mowing down groups of Corpus enemies while effectively managing shields and health pools through Magnetic and Heat damage. The Amprex’s inherent chain lightning effect will ensure that the crowd control and damage spread effectively among tightly packed enemy groups. Remember, modding in Warframe is highly personal and can be tweaked based on your mission, play style, and the specific enemies you're facing. Feel free to adjust this setup as you see fit, especially when considering elements like Forma and mod capacity to achieve the optimal build for your needs."},{"prompt":"Next, let's move on to secondaries I should bring for this mission.","completion":"For a level 35-40 Corpus mobile defense mission, your secondary weapon choice can serve as either a complement to your primary weapon or as a tool for specific situations that your primary might not be well-suited for. Given the Amprex's strength in area control and dealing with groups, you might want a secondary that either excels in quickly dispatching high-priority targets (like Corpus Nullifiers, Bursas, etc.) or provides utility that your primary does not. Here are some strong choices: 1. **Kuva Nukor**: This beam weapon is excellent for crowd control due to its unique chaining mechanic, which can arc to multiple targets, and has an incredibly high critical multiplier. Although your primary already handles crowd control, Kuva Nukor’s ability to apply multiple status effects quickly makes it an excellent choice for stacking status effects like Magnetic and Heat, which you're focusing on with your Amprex. This can be particularly useful against tougher Corpus units by stripping their shields and applying Heat's damage-over-time effect. 2. **Pyrana Prime**: This shotgun pistol can output a significant amount of damage in a short time, especially against single targets. It's powerful at close range and can quickly dispose of high-priority targets. Its unique passive, which temporarily gives you a second ghostly Pyrana Prime when achieving rapid kills, increases its damage output dramatically. 3. **Mara Detron**: A shotgun pistol that can be modded for devastating Magnetic damage, making it perfect for swiftly eliminating Corpus shields. Its status chance is also quite high, allowing it to apply various status effects with each shot. Modding it for additional Radiation damage can also make it highly effective against robotic enemies common in Corpus ranks. 4. **Kitgun** with a **Catchmoon** chamber: If you've ventured into Fortuna and built your own Kitgun, a Catchmoon chamber with the right components can serve as a powerful secondary, akin to a handheld Arca Plasmor. When modded for range, damage, and Magnetic, it becomes extremely effective at clearing both shields and groups of enemies. 5. **Staticor**: This charge-and-release type weapon fires blasts capable of dealing Magnetic damage innately, making it a handy tool for quickly stripping away Corpus shields. Additionally, its charged shots have a significant AoE effect, providing some utility in crowd control as well. For any of these secondary weapons, modding similarly to how you set up your Amprex can be effective: - **Hornet Strike** for base damage. - **Barrel Diffusion** and **Lethal Torrent** for multishot and fire rate. - **Pistol Gambit** and **Target Cracker** (or their Primed variants) for crit-based weapons like the Kuva Nukor or Pyrana Prime. - **Elements** for Magnetic and/or Heat depending on the weapon and base damage type. Consider also adding Radiation damage for increased effectiveness against Corpus robotics for some weapons. - **Utility mods** (such as reload speed or ammo mutation) based on personal preference or weapon needs. Remember, utility can also play a significant role in your secondary choice, especially if you find yourself frequently needing a quick way to dispatch enemies that have made it too close for comfort or if your primary is temporarily unavailable due to reloading or ammo scarcity."},{"prompt":"Melee time","completion":"For a level 35-40 Corpus mobile defense mission, especially when using Frost Prime and an Amprex focused on dealing with groups of enemies, you'll want a melee weapon that can either quickly eliminate high-priority targets, offer crowd control capabilities, or complement your existing setup with utility or survivability enhancements. Here are several types of melee weapons and specific examples that could work well: # 1. **Condition Overload Builds** These builds excel in dealing with enemies by scaling damage based on the number of different status effects inflicted upon the target. Given your setup's focus on applying statuses with the Amprex, these weapons can capitalize on that synergy. - **Lesion**: Automatically buffs itself upon inflicting a status effect, making it even more lethal. With innate Toxin damage, it can easily be modded for additional statuses like Magnetic or Heat when paired with the right mods. - **Silva & Aegis Prime**: Offers high status chance and exceptional damage reduction when blocking. Mod it for status and it becomes both a formidable weapon and a great defensive tool. # 2. **Critical Hit Builds** If you're looking for straight damage and quick kills on tougher individual targets, weapons with high critical chance and damage can be extremely effective. - **Nikana Prime** or **Dragon Nikana**: These offer a balance of speed, damage, and critical chance. Excellent for quick, high-damage slashes that can be further enhanced with the right stance and mods. - **Gram Prime**: A heavy blade with massive critical and status potential. Its wide swings can clear out groups of enemies while dealing immense damage to any heavy units. # 3. **Crowd Control and Area Denial** In some scenarios, you might want a melee weapon that helps manage large groups of enemies or provides additional control over the battlefield. - **Orthos Prime**: With its long reach and quick attack speed, it's excellent for hitting multiple enemies. Modding for range and status can make it a crowd control powerhouse. - **Atterax**: A whip with great range and the potential for high damage through slide attacks. When built with a focus on critical chance and damage (especially with a slide-crit build), it can mow down groups of enemies efficiently. # Mod Suggestions - **Condition Overload** (for status-focused weapons): Increases melee damage based on the number of different status effects on the target. - **Blood Rush**: Increases critical chance based on combo multiplier, excellent for weapons with solid base critical chance. - **Berserker** or **Berserker Fury**: Boosts attack speed following critical hits, which can greatly increase your damage output. - **Reach** or **Primed Reach**: Increases your melee range, allowing you to hit more enemies with each swing. - **Organ Shatter**: Increases critical damage, essential for crit-focused weapons. - **Elemental Mods** (e.g., **Volcanic Edge**, **Vicious Frost**): Mod for Magnetic/Heat to continue the theme of dealing with Corpus effectively. Choosing the right melee weapon and mod setup depends on your playstyle, the specific mission requirements, and how it synergizes with your Warframe and other weapon choices. Experimentation is key, as is modding to exploit specific enemy weaknesses."},{"prompt":"What helminth ability should I put on my frost prime for this mission?","completion":"Choosing a Helminth ability for Frost Prime, especially for a Corpus mobile defense mission, involves looking for synergies or addressing any potential weaknesses in Frost's kit. Frost Prime excels in defense and crowd control, but depending on your playstyle or the specific mission needs, you might want something that enhances his offensive capabilities, provides utility, or further bolsters his defensive strengths. Here are a few suggestions across different categories that could complement Frost Prime well in this scenario: # Offensive Abilities 1. **Eclipse (Mirage)**: When modded for ability strength, Eclipse can significantly boost Frost's damage output in light, making him much more lethal with his weapons. This ability dynamically adjusts based on lighting conditions, but with careful positioning, you can maximize its damage bonus for the mission's duration. 2. **Roar (Rhino)**: A straightforward damage buff for you and nearby allies, increasing all damage dealt. This can be quite beneficial in higher-level content where boosting your Amprex or other weapon's damage can make missions more manageable. # Utility Abilities 3. **Dispensary (Protea)**: Provides a consistent source of energy, health, and ammo pickups. Given Frost's reliance on abilities for defense and control, having a reliable way to replenish energy without relying solely on pickups or squad energy restores can drastically increase your mission sustainability and effectiveness. 4. **Pillage (Hildryn)**: Strips shields and armor from enemies while bolstering Frost's own shields, adding a layer of survivability and crowd control. This can be particularly useful against groups of Corpus enemies by rendering their shields ineffective. # Defensive Abilities 5. **Defy (Wukong)**: Grants Frost a brief period of increased damage resistance followed by a retaliation attack that also boosts his armor based on the damage received during the ability's active phase. This can further enhance Frost's durability, especially when holding down a mobile defense point against heavy enemy fire. 6. **Gloom (Sevagoth)**: Slows enemies within a large radius and siphons health from them based on damage dealt, providing crowd control and healing. Gloom can complement Frost's Snow Globe by slowing enemies that enter the globe's range, making them easier to manage. # Crowd Control 7. **Ensnare (Khora)**: Quickly immobilizes a target enemy and spreads to others nearby, pulling them together and making them easy targets for your weapons or abilities, potentially increasing the efficiency of clearing groups of enemies within or outside of Snow Globe. When selecting a Helminth ability to infuse onto Frost Prime, consider what aspect of your gameplay you would like to enhance or what potential gaps you might need to fill in your mission strategy. Each option presents a unique benefit that can be tailored to different playstyles and mission needs. Don't forget to adjust your build to take full advantage of the chosen ability, factoring in ability strength, range, duration, or efficiency as needed."},{"prompt":"What's the health calculation for figuring out the total health of one on Frost's globes?","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, the health of Frost's Snow Globe ability in Warframe is determined by a combination of base health and added health that scales with armor and ability strength. The calculation for the total health of Frost's Snow Globe upon casting includes both the ability's base health and additional health gained from Frost's armor multiplied by ability strength modifiers. Here's how it breaks down: # Base Calculation for Snow Globe's Health: 1. **Base Health**: Snow Globe starts with a base health that is fixed. This is 5,000 at max ability level. 2. **Armor Scaling**: The amount of additional health provided by Frost's armor, which also benefits from ability strength mods. # The Formula: Snow Globe's Total Health = Base Health + (Base Health * (Armor * (1 + Armor Mods)) * (1 + Ability Strength Mods)) Or more simplified: [ Total Health = Base Health times (1 + (Armor times (1 + Armor Mods) / 300) times (1 + Ability Strength Mods)) ] - **Base Health** is 5,000 at Snow Globe's maximum level before mods. - **Armor** refers to Frost's current armor value, which can be increased with mods like Steel Fiber. - **Armor Mods** is the total percentage increase to Frost's armor from mods. - **Ability Strength Mods** is the total percentage increase to ability strength from mods. # An Example Calculation: Assuming you have a Frost with: - 300 base armor, - +110% armor from using a Steel Fiber mod (+100%) and Armored Agility mod (+10%), - And +30% Ability Strength from using a mod like Intensify. The calculation would be: [ Total Health = 5,000 times (1 + (300 times (1 + 1.1) / 300) times (1 + 0.3)) ] [ Total Health = 5,000 times (1 + 2.1 times 1.3) ] [ Total Health = 5,000 times 3.73 ] [ Total Health = 18,650 ] This example shows Frost's Snow Globe having a total health of 18,650 after considering both the additional health provided by his scaled armor and the benefit of ability strength mods. Keep in mind this calculation can vary based on your Frost's build, the specific mods you have equipped, and any temporary boosts your Warframe may receive during gameplay. It's also important to note that Snow Globe's health can stack by casting it multiple times within its duration, and the globe absorbs all incoming damage as additional health for a few seconds after being cast, further increasing its durability."},{"prompt":"I'm using a ranked 30 frost prime. With no armor mods and 139% power strength. What would be the health of my globe?","completion":"To calculate the health of Frost Prime's Snow Globe with a Power Strength of 139% and no additional armor mods, first, we need to understand the base values and formula involved. As of the last update, Frost Prime has a base armor value of 300. The formula for Snow Globe's total health, considering both the base health, the effect of Frost's armor, and any modifications from Ability Strength mods, is as follows: [ text{Total Health} = text{Base Health} times left(1 + left(frac{text{Armor} times (1 + text{Armor Mods})}{300}right) times (1 + text{Ability Strength Mods})right) ] Given that: - Base Health of Snow Globe at max ability level = 5,000 - Frost Prime’s base armor = 300 (since no armor mods are applied, we don't modify this value) - Armor Mods = 0% (since no armor mods are being used) - Ability Strength Mods = 39% (as the base is 100%, and you've increased this by 39% to reach your 139% total power strength) Placing these values into our formula: [ text{Total Health} = 5,000 times left(1 + left(frac{300}{300}right) times (1 + 0.39)right) ] Simplifying this: [ text{Total Health} = 5,000 times left(1 + 1 times 1.39right) ] [ text{Total Health} = 5,000 times 2.39 ] [ text{Total Health} = 11,950 ] Therefore, with a Power Strength of 139% and no additional armor mods on a rank 30 Frost Prime, the total health of your Snow Globe would be 11,950."},{"prompt":"Ok, I have defy on my frost prime, it adds 750 armor at max.

This calculation considers the base armor of Frost Prime (300), plus the added 750 armor from Defy, and the effect of the power strength on Snow Globe's health formula."},{"prompt":"Ok, so I'm fighting level 35-40 corpus, what the average DPS I'll receive if I stand still for 2 seconds straight?","completion":"Calculating the exact DPS (damage per second) you would receive from enemies in Warframe is quite complex and depends on numerous factors, including the types and numbers of enemies engaging you, their accuracy, the damage types they are using, any damage mitigating factors from your Warframe's abilities and mods, and environmental factors that could influence the engagement. Warframe does not explicitly expose enemy damage values in a way that makes straightforward DPS calculations against a player character easy or accurate outside of controlled environments. However, I can provide a general understanding of what impacts DPS and how you can mitigate incoming damage, especially when facing Corpus at level 35-40: 1. **Enemy Types**: Corpus units primarily deal Shield and Impact damage, with some units like Techs and Fusion MOAs capable of dealing significant amounts of damage with their respective weapons. Special units like Nullifiers can dispel your abilities, indirectly causing you to take more damage if you rely on them for defense. 2. **Shield Damage**: Most Corpus weapons are designed to strip away shields effectively. Since Frost Prime has a decent shield capacity, expect initial hits to quickly deplete your shields. 3. **Armor and Health**: Once your shields are down, Corpus Impact damage is less effective against armor. However, Corpus Techs, Oxium Ospreys, and certain other units can deal considerable health damage if not managed quickly. 4. **Damage Mitigation**: Frost Prime's Snow Globe can absorb and nullify incoming damage from outside the globe, providing a significant defensive measure. Abilities like Defy further enhance your damage mitigation by adding a large amount of armor, reducing the percentage of health damage taken after shields are depleted. Given these factors, if you were to stand still for 2 seconds straight within the line of fire of multiple Corpus enemies at level 35-40 without any defensive measures, you could potentially see your shields stripped away almost instantaneously and start to lose health, especially if targeted by multiple or higher-damage units. However, the exact DPS would be difficult to quantify without specific details on enemy composition and their chosen targets. **General Tips to Mitigate Damage:** - **Stay Mobile**: Movement makes you harder to hit and is key to survival in Warframe. - **Use Snow Globe**: It's your main defensive tool as Frost Prime, offering excellent protection against incoming fire. - **Manage Abilities Smartly**: Abilities like Defy can significantly increase your resilience when your shields are down. - **Prioritize Threats**: Take down high-damage or special units quickly, such as Corpus Techs or Nullifiers. Remember, Warframe's dynamic combat encourages movement and using abilities over standing still, and effective use of Frost Prime's toolkit can greatly reduce the damage you receive."},{"prompt":"What is 0.16% × 250","completion":"To calculate 0.16% of 250, you can use the following calculation: [ 0.16% times 250 = frac{0.16}{100} times 250 = 0.0016 times 250 = 0.4 ] Therefore, 0.16% of 250 is 0.4."},{"prompt":"What is .16×250","completion":"[ 0.16 times 250 = 40 ] So, 0.16 multiplied by 250 equals 40."},{"prompt":"A=.16 B=6.

The explosion radius of Combustion Beam is **5 meters**. Please note that the effectiveness and utility of this mod can be context-dependent, often used in builds focused on clearing groups of lower-level enemies due to its fixed damage cap. It's always a good idea to refer to the latest game updates or community guides for the most current insights into mod performance and synergies."},{"prompt":"What are the ways to increase combustion beam's explosion damage and radius?","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, **Combustion Beam** is a mod in Warframe that causes enemies killed by beam weapons to explode, dealing additional damage within a 5-meter radius. The core aspects of **Combustion Beam**, like its explosion damage and radius, are fixed based on the mod's specifications and cannot be directly increased through modding. The explosion damage is set and does not scale with the weapon's damage or any other mods. However, there are general strategies and weapon characteristics that can indirectly enhance the overall effectiveness of Combustion Beam's explosion effect, even if they don't directly increase the damage or radius: # 1. **Increase Weapon Damage:** Increasing the overall damage of the beam weapon ensures that you kill enemies more swiftly, activating Combustion Beam's explosion effect more frequently. This can be achieved through: - **Damage Mods:** Mod your weapon with basic damage increase mods (e.g., Serration), elemental damage mods that the target is weak against, and critical chance/damage mods if the weapon has a decent critical chance. - **Elemental Combos:** Use elemental damage types that are particularly effective against the factions you're fighting. For example, modding for Magnetic damage (Electricity + Cold) can be effective against the Corpus as it is specifically potent against their shields. # 2. **Choose Weapons with High Status Chance:** While this doesn't directly increase Combustion Beam's radius or damage, weapons that can apply status effects efficiently can control groups of enemies more effectively, allowing for strategic placement of combustion explosions. # 3. Syndicate Weapons or Weapon Augments: Some weapons or weapon augments provide AoE (Area of Effect) effects upon reaching a certain threshold of affinity gain. While not directly increasing Combustion Beam's effectiveness, they complement its area damage effect, leading to more efficient clearance of groups of enemies. # 4. **Amprex and Beam Weapons with Chain Abilities:** Weapons like the Amprex, which can chain damage between multiple enemies, ensure that the effect of Combustion Beam is triggered more consistently across groups, not just isolated targets. While this doesn't increase the mod's explosion radius or damage per se, it does maximize the potential for AoE damage by ensuring more frequent activations spread among enemy groups. # General Playstyle Adjustments: Positioning and targeting tactics that prioritize groups of enemies can enhance the utility of Combustion Beam by taking advantage of its fixed explosion radius to affect as many enemies as possible. While these methods don't directly increase the explosion radius or damage of the Combustion Beam mod, they guide how to maximize its effectiveness in combat scenarios. Always confirm with the latest updates or community-shared tips, as game mechanics can evolve."},{"prompt":"I'm taking dethcube prime with me on this mission, I equipped Vegas to dethcube prime.","completion":"It sounds like you're configuring your Dethcube Prime for a mission in Warframe and plan to equip \\"Vegas\\" on it.

To maximize the efficiency of the **Verglas** on your Dethcube Prime, consider modding strategies that enhance its strengths: # 1. **Status Chance:** Since the **Verglas** can benefit from applying status effects with its cold damage, mods that increase status chance are very beneficial. This helps in more consistently applying the cold status effect, which slows enemies. # 2. **Damage:** Mods that increase base damage, such as **Serration** (adjusted for Sentinel weapons), can boost the overall damage output of the **Verglas**. # 3. **Elemental Mods:** Combining Cold damage with other elements to create combinations like **Blast** (Cold + Heat) or **Magnetic** (Cold + Electricity) can tailor the Verglas to be more effective against certain enemy factions. For example, Magnetic is particularly effective against Corpus enemies. # 4. **Multishot:** Mods that add multishot, such as **Barrel Diffusion** (again, adjusted for Sentinel weapons), will increase the number of projectiles fired per shot, effectively increasing damage output and the chance to apply status effects. # 5. **Fire Rate:** Increasing the fire rate with mods can allow the **Verglas** to hit enemies more frequently, aiding in crowd control by applying the slowing effect more often. # 6. **Utility and QoL Mods:** Don't forget about utility mods that can, for instance, increase ammo capacity or improve reload speed, maintaining your weapon's uptime and efficiency in longer missions. Remember to balance your mod selections based on your mission type, the enemies you anticipate facing, and how you've configured your Dethcube Prime's other abilities and mods. The Verglas, with the right setup, can be a powerful tool for controlling the battlefield while dealing significant damage."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Also, how could this keep the story from feeling like propaganda?","completion":"The device you're describing, where a protagonist directs undue anger towards a clearly allied character, can be a potent narrative tool, but it needs to be handled with care to avoid derailing the story or alienating the audience. This dynamic can: 1. **Deepen Character Complexity**: It makes the protagonist more three-dimensional by exposing their flaws, vulnerabilities, or perhaps unhealed traumas. This can create a more relatable and human character but requires careful characterization to ensure the protagonist remains sympathetic. 2. **Fuel Character Development**: Such conflicts can prompt significant growth in both characters. The protagonist's journey might involve learning humility, empathy, or the value of trust and camaraderie. Conversely, the ally might grow more resilient, assertive, or forgiving. 3. **Highlight Themes**: This tension can be used to explore themes like forgiveness, the destructive nature of unchecked anger, the power of empathy, and the necessity of communication in relationships. To ensure the story doesn’t feel like propaganda or a heavy-handed moral lesson, consider these strategies: **1. Balance and Nuance**: Show the protagonist's perspective comprehensively, including their internal conflicts and motivations. However, also depict the ally's side and the consequences of the protagonist's actions, ensuring the narrative doesn't unjustly favor one character over another. **2. Consequences and Accountability**: Ensure the protagonist faces realistic repercussions for their actions, and that these actions are not simply brushed aside or quickly forgiven without genuine remorse and effort to make amends. This prevents the message from feeling preachy or oversimplified. **3. Gray Morality and Complexity**: Avoid depicting issues in black-and-white terms. Instead, embrace the complexity of human emotions and relationships. Recognize that both characters might have valid points and flaws, which can help prevent the story from seeming one-sided. **4. Relatable Motivations**: Ensure the protagonist’s anger is rooted in understandable or relatable motivations, even if misguided. This helps the audience empathize with the protagonist instead of viewing them as purely antagonistic or unreasonable. **5. Gradual Resolution**: Rather than quick fixes, let the characters gradually work through their issues. Show them engaging in meaningful dialogue, reflecting on their actions, and genuinely striving to understand each other. This process can mirror real-life conflicts and resolutions, making the story feel more authentic and less like a vehicle for a particular message. Using conflict to drive character development and thematic exploration is powerful, but the key lies in treating your characters as complex, fallible human beings rather than mere mouthpieces for a point of view. This approach allows for a richer, more engaging story that resonates with the audience on a deeper level."},{"prompt":"maybe it could be over a disagreement or a misunderstanding on the protagonist's part. Also, could the undue anger towards an ally feel sympathetic if the protagonist is shown being kind and self aware, and heroic in a lot of other times?","completion":"Certainly, a disagreement or misunderstanding can be a very relatable and effective catalyst for the undue anger directed from the protagonist towards an ally. These scenarios can add depth and realism to the characters and their relationships by highlighting their imperfections and the complexities of human interactions. In terms of making the protagonist's undue anger feel sympathetic despite the negative outburst towards an ally, there are several narrative strategies you can employ: # Demonstrate Complexity and Relatability 1. **Backstory and Stressors**: Provide context for the protagonist's anger by showing the stress, pressures, or past traumas they are dealing with. This doesn’t excuse their behavior but helps the audience understand it. 2. **Internal Conflict**: Portray the protagonist as internally conflicted about their outburst. Showing regret, self-awareness, or attempts to rationalize their anger makes them more relatable and sympathetic. # Balance in Characterization 1. **Show Positive Traits**: Ensure the protagonist is depicted as capable of kindness, empathy, and heroism at other times. This contrast in their behavior underscores that the outburst is not their defining characteristic, but a moment of weakness. 2. **Realistic Reactions**: The ally’s response should also be nuanced. They might be hurt or confused but can also show understanding or concern for the underlying reasons behind the protagonist's anger. This can help prevent the scenario from seeming overly dramatic or contrived. # Narrative Integration 1. **Plot and Theme Integration**: Use the conflict to explore and advance themes relevant to the story, such as the importance of communication, the dangers of jumping to conclusions, or the power of forgiveness and reconciliation. 2. **Consequences and Growth**: Make sure there are tangible consequences to the protagonist’s actions, and use these consequences as a catalyst for personal growth. An arc where the protagonist works to earn forgiveness and rebuild trust can be compelling and rewarding. # Empathy Through Relatability Creating a protagonist who is deeply human—capable of both great kindness and regrettable mistakes—can make their moment of improper anger towards an ally not just sympathetic but profoundly relatable. Audience empathy is often strongest in the presence of nuanced characters who reflect the real complexities of human emotion and morality. By maintaining a careful balance in how the character's actions are portrayed and ensuring there's meaningful development arising from the conflict, you can avoid alienating your audience. Instead, you provide them with a richer, more engaging narrative experience that encourages reflection on the nature of conflict, understanding, and forgiveness in human relationships."},{"prompt":"could a good way to show the protagonist isn't toxic, be them actually letting the person they are angry at explain themselves?","completion":"Yes, allowing the protagonist to let the person they are angry at explain themselves is an excellent way to demonstrate that the protagonist is not inherently toxic. This approach can serve several important functions in the narrative: 1. **Facilitates Communication**: It underscores the importance of communication and listening in resolving conflicts. By showing the protagonist open to hearing the other side, you highlight their willingness to understand and empathize, which is antithetical to toxic behavior. 2. **Shows Maturity and Growth**: It can be a moment of significant character development. Acknowledging anger and then consciously deciding to listen and engage constructively shows maturity and a capacity for growth, distancing the protagonist from toxicity. 3. **Humanizes Both Characters**: This interaction can deepen the audience's understanding of both characters. The protagonist's willingness to listen humanizes them and fosters empathy, while the ally's explanation can provide insights into their motivations, further adding layers to their character. 4. **Reduces Misunderstandings**: It's a narrative device that can be used to reduce or resolve misunderstandings, highlighting how assumptions and quick judgments can lead to conflict. This can reinforce the theme that patience and open-mindedness are virtues. 5. **Promotes Empathy**: It encourages the audience to empathize with both characters. Seeing a protagonist actively trying to understand rather than react impulsively can remind the audience of the value of empathy and patience in their own lives. 6. **Strengthens Relationships**: It can strengthen the relationship between the characters involved, showing that their bond can withstand disagreements and anger. This resilience can endear both the protagonist and the ally to the audience further. Incorporating a scene or moments where the protagonist shows this level of consideration and openness not only helps in steering clear of painting them as toxic but also enriches the narrative by promoting themes of communication, understanding, and personal growth. It's a powerful way to show that conflicts, even those involving anger and frustration, can lead to positive outcomes when handled with care and empathy."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This trend has been further reinforced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations General Assembly, 2015) that considers inclusive education a global goal to achieve human rights principles. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Special Needs affirms not only the right to education but also a \\"comprehensive education system at all levels\\" by the end of 2015, which has been ratified by most countries around the world. Inclusive education is defined as \\"the ability of the educational system to provide the necessary academic and behavioral support to all students, regardless of disability or difference (i.e. gender, race, location or language), to participate and succeed in scholastic academic, Social, methodological and extracurricular activities alongside their peers \\" (Parnell,2017,p.3). Inclusion exceed geographical change in the classroom andincludes a distinct mindset that focuses on the abilities and needs of all students in the classroom (UNESCO, 1994). Inclusion has benefits that include both regular students and with special needs students . It was found that students with special needswho receive inclusive education have obtained better educational and social outcomes (Rujis & Peetsma, 2009). For regular students, there have been improvements in social skills and tolerance towards their special needs peers (Kalambouka, Farrell, Dyson,& Kaplan, 2007). This is confirmed by recent literature reviews that indicate the effectiveness of inclusion in the social and academic outcomes of all students, not just students with special needs (Black-Hawkins, 2010; Hehir et al. 2017; Rose, Gravel & Gordon, 2014).The past three decades have witnessed an important educational reforms in relation to students with special needs. These students were previously taught in separate schools, but large numbers of students with special needs are now taught regularly in public education schools. The composition of the general education school classes in a certain countries of the world, like Canada and the United States of America, has changed dramatically. 96% of regular school teachers in the United States of America indicated that there are one student with special needs in the class (Rock, Gregg, Ellis, & Gable, 2008 ). This is similar to Australia, where two-thirds of all students with special needs receive education in general education schools (Forlin, Chambers, Loreman, Deppeler, & Sharma, 2013). However, the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in general schools in developing countries is relatively lower than that in advanced countries. Successful inclusion requires a learning environment that includes a diverse group of individuals and key elements. These elements includes school reform, changing attitudes, cooperation, teaching strategies and enhanced classrooms (Swart & Pettipher, 2011). Individuals who play a vital role in the effective implementation of inclusive education include parents, teachers, school administrators, specialists in various fields and support teams. The results of the studies confirm the view that among all these individuals, teachers are key to successful inclusion and that inclusive education can only be successful if teachers are part of the team that leads this process (Malone et al., 2001). Therefore, teacher participation is an essential and integral component of an effective implementation of inclusive education (Haskell, 2000; Forlin, Cedillo, Romero-Contreras et al., 2010; Donald et al., 2010).Educational literature indicates that teachers are facing increasing stress to meet the unique needs of learners in inclusive classes (Berry, 2010).This requires them to hone their knowledge and skills, develop new knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as open minded teachers in order to accommodate the curricula, corporate with other partners like special education teachers ((Swart& Pettipher,2005). Thus, in order to enable inclusive education, teachers need to adapt to their changing roles. This requires a great sense of self-efficacy (Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2012). Self-efficacy of teachers is one of the factors that has received a great attention among researchers (Al-Qumeiz,2019; Savolainen, et al., 2012; Meijer & Foster, 1988; Soodak & Podell, 1993). Several studies have indicated that self-efficacy is an indicator of a willingness to teach in inclusive classes (Forlin et al. 2010; Malinen, Savolainen, & Xu, 2012; Savolainen et al. 2012). Research shows that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy have more positive attitudes toward inclusion (Malinen, et al.,2012), are less likely to refer a disadvantaged student to special education services (Soodak & Podell, 1993), and more willing to provide Special assistance to students with lower achievement levels (Ross, 1992). Self-efficacy influences teaching behaviors and the use of creative teaching in the classroom (Holzberger, Philipp, & Kunter, 2013; Schiefele & Schaffner, 2015; Zee & Koomen, 2016). Educating students with special needs in the inclusive classes impose teachers in front of educational challenges (Jennett, Harris, & Mesibov, 2003; Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, & Goodwin, 2003). The main disabilities associated with students with special needs affect the increased exposure of teachers to stress and burnout, which are factors associated with the attrition of teachers' energies (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Boyer & Gillespie, 2000). Teachers with high self-efficacy have low stress, they continue to teach longer, and are more motivated than teachers with low self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Ware & Kitsantas, 2007). Therefore, the self-efficacyof teachers is a protective factor for psychological burnout common in the teaching profession. Researchers emphasized that it is necessary to pay attention to the sources of self-efficacy in order to explore how individuals build the beliefs of their own efficacy (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991) . Because teachers ’self-efficacy in the inclusive classes is associated with many positive outcomes within the class, the researchers have tended to explore the sources of teachers’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is based on four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states (Bandura, 1997). Performance achievements are defined as feeling satisfied with successful teaching experiences in the past. Verbal persuasion refers to self-efficacy judgments based on verbal stimulation of others such as colleagues, supervisors, managers, students, and parents. Emotional states represent control of the level of activation (i.e. fatigue, stress, anxiety, tension and mood), which in turn can directly affect the provisions related to teaching ability (Fernandez-Rio et al., 2016). Uncovering the sources of self-efficacy for teachers in the inclusion classes provides an important basis for obtaining important insightson how to enhance self-efficacy during teacher training (Gaskill & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002; Lebone, 2004; Henson, 2002). Understanding the potential sources of teacher self-efficacy in the inclusive classes helps to identify factors that should be targeted in professional development activities for teachers (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2017).Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2007) notes that teacher self-efficacy is context specific. It is important to test the theoretical assumptions underlying self-efficacy in avariety of cultural contexts. The cultural context is one of the most important contexts that may lead to the variation of teachers ’self-efficacy. Many literature emphasizes the need for multicultural studies of self-efficacy, which often depend on culture and historical background (Klassen & Chiu, 2010; Klassen, 2004b; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).It is possible that the sources of self-efficacy of inclusive practices will depend on cultural background. 2- Problem Statement Research over the past three decades on implementing inclusive education indicates that the success or failure of inclusion depends on many factors such as state policies, the availability of resources, the leadership of the principal, employees cooperation, and the characteristics of teachers such as the acquisition of knowledge, skills, , attitudes toward inclusion and self-efficacy (Kuyini, Desaib & Sharma, 2018; Loreman, Sharma & Forlin 2013; Leyser, Zeiger & Romi, 2011; Kuyini & Desai, 2008; Friend & Bursuck, 2009). The self-efficacyof teachers in the inclusive classes is one of the most important factors that may lead to the success or failure of the inclusion. It is associated with many variables such as attitude towards inclusion, copying strategies and motivation (Savolainen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2011). It affects teachers making essential adjustments in the classroom, such as adjusting curriculum content or instruction (De Boer, Pijl, & Minnaert 2011; Wilson et al. 2016).Bandura (1997) notes that teachers build their beliefs about self-efficacy by processing information from four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. Research recently tended to reveal the sources of this self-efficacy , Which may contribute to enhancing the self-efficacy of in-service teachers and identifying factors that should be targeted in professional development programs and activities. Many literature emphasizes the need to conduct multicultural studies of self-efficacy. These international comparisons are useful because it provides insight into the factors that constitute self-efficacy beliefs in different cultural contexts. Besides that, there are not enough empirical results so far to demonstrate whether countries with a long history of implementing inclusion in general education schools differ from the countries in which inclusion has begun to be implemented. Comparing the self-efficacy of teaching practices in inclusive classes and their potential sources between Saudi Arabia and Egypt may benefit in providing new insights into the factors that constitute this efficacy. The results of comparative studies may have implications for how to prepare and support pre-service and in-service teachers to implement inclusion in general education schools (Sharma, Aiello, Pace, Round & Subban, 2018). The current research problem arises in the following questions: 1.Are there statistically significant differences between mean scores of self-efficacy for Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? 2.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? 3.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional state in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? 3- Methodology Participants Participants in the study are in-service teachers working in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in inclusive schools for students with special needs and regular. They were chosen intentionally. The Saudi sample were (250) male and female teachers representing (8) schools in Arar city, affiliated to the Education Department in the Northern Borders Region, north of Saudi Arabia.The study instruments were distributed among them, during the month of April 2019, (96) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 38.4%.The Egyptian sample were (200) male and female teachers representing (6) schools in Beba, affiliated to the Beba Educational Administration in Beni Suef Governorate, south of Egypt. The study instruments were distributed among them, during the march of 2019, (88) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 44%. Instruments - Teacher self-efficacy scale: This scale was developed by Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk -Hoy (2001) with the goal of determining the strength and nature of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It consists of three dimensions including instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management. The researcher used the abbreviated form (12 items). The items were distributed among the three dimensions shown as follows: instructional strategies (5, 9, 10, 12), student engagement (2,3, 4, 11), and classroom management (1, 6, 7, 8). For each item asked teachers to assess their ability to influence the outcome (\\"How much can you do?\\") in a 9-point Likert scale from 1 to 9: Nothing (1-2), very little (3-4), Some infulence (5-6), quite abit (7-8), a great deal (9). Consequently, the maximum score for the scale was 108, and the lowest score, 12. The scale author used factor analysis to test the validity of the construction by 225 in-service and 111 pre-service teachers . Factor analysis showed three factors, which accounted for 65% and 61% of the variance respectively . The factor analysis of the current study showed three factors that accounted for 78% of the variance. The reliability of instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management dimensions were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The general reliability of scale was 0.96. - The sources of self-efficacy scale: The SSE scale was prepared by Hoi, Zhou,Teo & Nie (2017). The scale consists of 26 items divided into four dimensions, including performance achievements (1-6), alternative experiences (7-12), verbal persuasion (13-20), and emotional states (21-26). The responses are according to a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Disagree(1 ) to Strongly Agree (7 ). The scale authors used factor analysis to investigate the validity of the construction. Factor analysis showed four factors, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The authors of the scale used also confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the scale had acceptable indicators (χ2 (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 (.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Confirmatory factor analysis was used in the current study to test the indictors of the SSE scale. The results showed acceptable indicators (χ2 / df = 133.154; GFI: .900; CFI:.911; RMSEA: .058; SRMR: .051). The authors of the scale indicated that the alpha coefficient of the four dimensions of the scale; performance achievements, alternativeexperiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states were 0.89, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.87. The general reliability of scale was 0.81. Regarding the current study , the researcher used the Alpha-Cronbach coefficient. The results showed a significant values for the four dimensions: performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states as following; 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.9. Procedures After obtaining official approvals from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Northern Borders, the researcher distributed the study measures to the research sample in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. After two months, the researcher analyzed the data using SPSS (Ver.23). Data analysis The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 software. The researcher used independent-samples t-test to answer the first question of the study. The researcher used stepwise multiple regression analysis to answer the second and third question for the study.Results and discussion Regarding the first question “Are there statistically significant difference between mean scores of self-efficacy between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? independent –samples t-test was used to analyze the data.Results indicated that there were a significant differences in all dimensions of self-efficacy and overall self-efficacy in favor to Egyptian teachers. Regarding the second question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The model was able to predict (53%) of self-efficacy.. By the stepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements , alternative experiences , verbal persuasion, and emotional states . one of these; performance achievements successfullypredicted self-efficacy among Saudi teachers . Regarding the third question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.. The model was able to predict (13%) of self-efficacy. By the tepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. One of these; performance achievements successfully predicted self-efficacy among Egyptian teachers. . The results of the research indicated in its answer to the first question that there were statistically significant differences between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in the self-efficacy of inclusive practices and its dimensions; teaching strategies, student engagement and class management in favor to Egyptian teachers, although the general level of self-efficacy in both countries was below average based on the study scale (12-108). This result is consistent with Savolainenet al.(2012), which indicated that there are significant differences in a certain dimensions of the self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools between Finland and South Africa, Sharma and Jacobs(2016) that indicated there are significant differencesbetween general education teachers in India and Australia in self-efficacy within the inclusive classes, Sharma, et al.( 2018) which indicated that there are significant differences in self-efficacy in the inclusive practices between teachers in Italy and Australia, and Miesera and Gebhardt(2018) that indicated significant differences in self-efficacy in inclusive practices among teachers in Canada and Germany. The researcher attributes this in light of the associations between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, classroom teaching practices and student learning outcomes (Anderson, et al., 1988). In the context of Egyptian education, competition among students inside schools is very high, and the teaching strategies used by teachers are more efficient and effective. This is due to the fact that the majority of Egyptian teachers work in private teaching after the end of school hours . The way to increase the financial returns from this courses is to improve the teaching process in a desire for students to reach high levels of achievement excellence. This is consistent with Heine and Hamamura (2007) and Kurman (2003) indicated that the self-efficacy of teachers increases in countries where independence is greatly emphasized. Independence means reducing educational supervision, which applies to teachers in the field of private teaching. Besides, the concept of inclusion is a relatively recent concept among Egyptian education schools. Stakeholders for educational policies in Egypt have approved a rewarding financial incentives for teachers in inclusive schools and providing them with a qualified and recent training courses. Besides that, assigning special education teachers as experts and supportive for general education teachers in each educational administration in which the inclusion is applied are provided. These external factors can lead to a shift in the teachers ’locus of control from being external to an internal where teachers believe that the outcomes are more based on aperson’s own behavior than on external sources and circumstances (Rotter, 1966). This is consistent with what Teschanen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2001) emphasized, the close association between locus of control and self-efficacy. These cultural differences in self-efficacy can be attributed to the self-enhancement needs(SEN). SEN is defined as a motivation to search for activities and social trends leading to maintaining a positive image. The motivation of Egyptian teachers to teach students with special needs in inclusive classes stems from their desire to preserve a positive image compared to the Saudi teachers. The researcher believes that the efforts of in-service teacher training in Egypt in recent years, which focused on developing the skills of teachers in the classroom, with special reference to skills in behavior management in the classroom with various groups of students, have led to an increase in teachers' belief in their ability to performing various teaching tasks with acceptance quality in different teaching situations and thus improving their level of self-efficacy. Therefore, the results seem to indicate that Egyptian teachers now generally have a stronger belief in their ability to manage diverse needs and behaviors in the classroom, design and implement educational activities to assist different learners in learning, and competence in ensuring student participation and motivation towards learning. The results of the research indicated in its answer to the second and third questions Performance. achievements or mastery experiences were the most predictable sources of self-efficacy for teachers in self-efficacy in inclusion practices, whether in Saudi Arabia or Egypt. These results are consistent with what Bandura (1997) indicated that performance achievements are the most powerful source of self-efficacy. It is consistent with (Milner, 2002; Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2007; Bruce & Ross, 2008; Usher & Pajares, 2008; Malinen et al., 2012; Yada, et al., 2019; Wilson, Woolfson & Durkin, 2020). These results are inconsistent with Sharma, Shaukat, and Furlonger (2014) that indicated developmental knowledge of legislation and policies, and less concerns about teaching in inclusion classes, were key predictors of improving the teaching efficiency of inclusive practices. it is inconsistent with Emam and Al-Mahdy (2019) which indicated the variation of the self-efficacy of general education teachers in inclusion schools in Oman, with gender differences and the number of years of teaching experience. The researcher attributes the current results in the light of social cognitive theory. SCT indicates that the reciprocal relationship between behavioral and personal factors, where teachers make decisions related to their perceived capabilities based on their previous performance. When teachers look at their past performance, they can determine the extent of their ability to teach in the inclusive classes. When they believe that a certain strategies were successful, they can use this experience to enrich their practice in the coming years. Likewise, through experience, teachers may become confident about their effective working strategies which leading to enhancing the effectiveness of classroom management. Previous experience also helps teachers motivate and engage students, which enhances the effectiveness of student engagement in the classroom. The results of the study indicate that the performance achievements explained 53% of the variance in the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers, while 13% of the variation in the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers. The researcher attributes this to that there may be other sources related to the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers such as mastery of knowledge (Morris et al., 2017), collective efficacy (Goddard & Goddard, 2001), school environment (Wilson, Woolfson & Durkin, 2020), training, and direction towards inclusion. 4- Recommendations According to the results, the researcher presents the following recommendations: First, Given the small sample size , the results cannot be generalized. Therefore this study must be repeated again by a large sample. Second, In light of the lower of the percentage of explained variance by the performance achievements for the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers, future research must address others sources of self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools in Egypt. Third, Questionnaire -based studies cannot provide complete answers to explain the difference in cultural differences in self-efficacy among teachers. This is requires in-depth qualitative analysis, therefore future research should rely on a mixed method that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis in order to achieve this goal. Fourth, It is important for researchers in Saudi Arabia and Egypt to conduct comparative studies with samples from different societies. This will help stakeholders to assess the Saudi and Egyptian situation related to teacher efficacy in an international context. This can help in measuring improvements compared to these other societies. 5- Conclusions The results of the current study showed a significant difference of self-efficacy in inclusive schools between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in favor to Egyptian teachers. Results indicated that only performance achievements or mastery experiences are the successful predictor of self-efficacy among Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers. The results of the study indicate that the performance achievements explained 53% of the variance in the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers, while 13% of the variation in the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers.","completion":"It seems like your text contains a long discussion about the importance of inclusive education, the role of teachers in implementing inclusive practices, the factors influencing self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive classrooms, a comparison between Saudi and Egyptian teachers in terms of self-efficacy, and the methodology used in your study.

This trend has been further reinforced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations General Assembly, 2015) that considers inclusive education a global goal to achieve human rights principles. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Special Needs affirms not only the right to education but also a \\"comprehensive education system at all levels\\" by the end of 2015, which has been ratified by most countries around the world. Inclusive education is defined as \\"the ability of the educational system to provide the necessary academic and behavioral support to all students, regardless of disability or difference (i.e. gender, race, location or language), to participate and succeed in scholastic academic, Social, methodological and extracurricular activities alongside their peers \\" (Parnell,2017,p.3). Inclusion exceed geographical change in the classroom andincludes a distinct mindset that focuses on the abilities and needs of all students in the classroom (UNESCO, 1994). Inclusion has benefits that include both regular students and with special needs students . It was found that students with special needswho receive inclusive education have obtained better educational and social outcomes (Rujis & Peetsma, 2009). For regular students, there have been improvements in social skills and tolerance towards their special needs peers (Kalambouka, Farrell, Dyson,& Kaplan, 2007). This is confirmed by recent literature reviews that indicate the effectiveness of inclusion in the social and academic outcomes of all students, not just students with special needs (Black-Hawkins, 2010; Hehir et al. 2017; Rose, Gravel & Gordon, 2014).The past three decades have witnessed an important educational reforms in relation to students with special needs. These students were previously taught in separate schools, but large numbers of students with special needs are now taught regularly in public education schools. The composition of the general education school classes in a certain countries of the world, like Canada and the United States of America, has changed dramatically. 96% of regular school teachers in the United States of America indicated that there are one student with special needs in the class (Rock, Gregg, Ellis, & Gable, 2008 ). This is similar to Australia, where two-thirds of all students with special needs receive education in general education schools (Forlin, Chambers, Loreman, Deppeler, & Sharma, 2013). However, the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in general schools in developing countries is relatively lower than that in advanced countries. Successful inclusion requires a learning environment that includes a diverse group of individuals and key elements. These elements includes school reform, changing attitudes, cooperation, teaching strategies and enhanced classrooms (Swart & Pettipher, 2011). Individuals who play a vital role in the effective implementation of inclusive education include parents, teachers, school administrators, specialists in various fields and support teams. The results of the studies confirm the view that among all these individuals, teachers are key to successful inclusion and that inclusive education can only be successful if teachers are part of the team that leads this process (Malone et al., 2001). Therefore, teacher participation is an essential and integral component of an effective implementation of inclusive education (Haskell, 2000; Forlin, Cedillo, Romero-Contreras et al., 2010; Donald et al., 2010).Educational literature indicates that teachers are facing increasing stress to meet the unique needs of learners in inclusive classes (Berry, 2010).This requires them to hone their knowledge and skills, develop new knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as open minded teachers in order to accommodate the curricula, corporate with other partners like special education teachers ((Swart& Pettipher,2005). Thus, in order to enable inclusive education, teachers need to adapt to their changing roles. This requires a great sense of self-efficacy (Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2012). Self-efficacy of teachers is one of the factors that has received a great attention among researchers (Al-Qumeiz,2019; Savolainen, et al., 2012; Meijer & Foster, 1988; Soodak & Podell, 1993). Several studies have indicated that self-efficacy is an indicator of a willingness to teach in inclusive classes (Forlin et al. 2010; Malinen, Savolainen, & Xu, 2012; Savolainen et al. 2012). Research shows that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy have more positive attitudes toward inclusion (Malinen, et al.,2012), are less likely to refer a disadvantaged student to special education services (Soodak & Podell, 1993), and more willing to provide Special assistance to students with lower achievement levels (Ross, 1992). Self-efficacy influences teaching behaviors and the use of creative teaching in the classroom (Holzberger, Philipp, & Kunter, 2013; Schiefele & Schaffner, 2015; Zee & Koomen, 2016). Educating students with special needs in the inclusive classes impose teachers in front of educational challenges (Jennett, Harris, & Mesibov, 2003; Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, & Goodwin, 2003). The main disabilities associated with students with special needs affect the increased exposure of teachers to stress and burnout, which are factors associated with the attrition of teachers' energies (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Boyer & Gillespie, 2000). Teachers with high self-efficacy have low stress, they continue to teach longer, and are more motivated than teachers with low self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Ware & Kitsantas, 2007). Therefore, the self-efficacyof teachers is a protective factor for psychological burnout common in the teaching profession. Researchers emphasized that it is necessary to pay attention to the sources of self-efficacy in order to explore how individuals build the beliefs of their own efficacy (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991) . Because teachers ’self-efficacy in the inclusive classes is associated with many positive outcomes within the class, the researchers have tended to explore the sources of teachers’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is based on four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states (Bandura, 1997). Performance achievements are defined as feeling satisfied with successful teaching experiences in the past. Verbal persuasion refers to self-efficacy judgments based on verbal stimulation of others such as colleagues, supervisors, managers, students, and parents. Emotional states represent control of the level of activation (i.e. fatigue, stress, anxiety, tension and mood), which in turn can directly affect the provisions related to teaching ability (Fernandez-Rio et al., 2016). Uncovering the sources of self-efficacy for teachers in the inclusion classes provides an important basis for obtaining important insightson how to enhance self-efficacy during teacher training (Gaskill & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002; Lebone, 2004; Henson, 2002). Understanding the potential sources of teacher self-efficacy in the inclusive classes helps to identify factors that should be targeted in professional development activities for teachers (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2017).Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2007) notes that teacher self-efficacy is context specific. It is important to test the theoretical assumptions underlying self-efficacy in avariety of cultural contexts. The cultural context is one of the most important contexts that may lead to the variation of teachers ’self-efficacy. Many literature emphasizes the need for multicultural studies of self-efficacy, which often depend on culture and historical background (Klassen & Chiu, 2010; Klassen, 2004b; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).It is possible that the sources of self-efficacy of inclusive practices will depend on cultural background. 2- Problem Statement Research over the past three decades on implementing inclusive education indicates that the success or failure of inclusion depends on many factors such as state policies, the availability of resources, the leadership of the principal, employees cooperation, and the characteristics of teachers such as the acquisition of knowledge, skills, , attitudes toward inclusion and self-efficacy (Kuyini, Desaib & Sharma, 2018; Loreman, Sharma & Forlin 2013; Leyser, Zeiger & Romi, 2011; Kuyini & Desai, 2008; Friend & Bursuck, 2009). The self-efficacyof teachers in the inclusive classes is one of the most important factors that may lead to the success or failure of the inclusion. It is associated with many variables such as attitude towards inclusion, copying strategies and motivation (Savolainen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2011). It affects teachers making essential adjustments in the classroom, such as adjusting curriculum content or instruction (De Boer, Pijl, & Minnaert 2011; Wilson et al. 2016).Bandura (1997) notes that teachers build their beliefs about self-efficacy by processing information from four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. Research recently tended to reveal the sources of this self-efficacy , Which may contribute to enhancing the self-efficacy of in-service teachers and identifying factors that should be targeted in professional development programs and activities. Many literature emphasizes the need to conduct multicultural studies of self-efficacy. These international comparisons are useful because it provides insight into the factors that constitute self-efficacy beliefs in different cultural contexts. Besides that, there are not enough empirical results so far to demonstrate whether countries with a long history of implementing inclusion in general education schools differ from the countries in which inclusion has begun to be implemented. Comparing the self-efficacy of teaching practices in inclusive classes and their potential sources between Saudi Arabia and Egypt may benefit in providing new insights into the factors that constitute this efficacy. The results of comparative studies may have implications for how to prepare and support pre-service and in-service teachers to implement inclusion in general education schools (Sharma, Aiello, Pace, Round & Subban, 2018). The current research problem arises in the following questions: 1.Are there statistically significant differences between mean scores of self-efficacy for Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? 2.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? 3.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional state in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? 3- Methodology Participants Participants in the study are in-service teachers working in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in inclusive schools for students with special needs and regular. They were chosen intentionally. The Saudi sample were (250) male and female teachers representing (8) schools in Arar city, affiliated to the Education Department in the Northern Borders Region, north of Saudi Arabia.The study instruments were distributed among them, during the month of April 2019, (96) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 38.4%.The Egyptian sample were (200) male and female teachers representing (6) schools in Beba, affiliated to the Beba Educational Administration in Beni Suef Governorate, south of Egypt. The study instruments were distributed among them, during the march of 2019, (88) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 44%. Instruments - Teacher self-efficacy scale: This scale was developed by Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk -Hoy (2001) with the goal of determining the strength and nature of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It consists of three dimensions including instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management. The researcher used the abbreviated form (12 items). The items were distributed among the three dimensions shown as follows: instructional strategies (5, 9, 10, 12), student engagement (2,3, 4, 11), and classroom management (1, 6, 7, 8). For each item asked teachers to assess their ability to influence the outcome (\\"How much can you do?\\") in a 9-point Likert scale from 1 to 9: Nothing (1-2), very little (3-4), Some infulence (5-6), quite abit (7-8), a great deal (9). Consequently, the maximum score for the scale was 108, and the lowest score, 12. The scale author used factor analysis to test the validity of the construction by 225 in-service and 111 pre-service teachers . Factor analysis showed three factors, which accounted for 65% and 61% of the variance respectively . The factor analysis of the current study showed three factors that accounted for 78% of the variance. The reliability of instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management dimensions were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The general reliability of scale was 0.96. - The sources of self-efficacy scale: The SSE scale was prepared by Hoi, Zhou,Teo & Nie (2017). The scale consists of 26 items divided into four dimensions, including performance achievements (1-6), alternative experiences (7-12), verbal persuasion (13-20), and emotional states (21-26). The responses are according to a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Disagree(1 ) to Strongly Agree (7 ). The scale authors used factor analysis to investigate the validity of the construction. Factor analysis showed four factors, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The authors of the scale used also confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the scale had acceptable indicators (χ2 (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 (.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Confirmatory factor analysis was used in the current study to test the indictors of the SSE scale. The results showed acceptable indicators (χ2 / df = 133.154; GFI: .900; CFI:.911; RMSEA: .058; SRMR: .051). The authors of the scale indicated that the alpha coefficient of the four dimensions of the scale; performance achievements, alternativeexperiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states were 0.89, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.87. The general reliability of scale was 0.81. Regarding the current study , the researcher used the Alpha-Cronbach coefficient. The results showed a significant values for the four dimensions: performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states as following; 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.9. Procedures After obtaining official approvals from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Northern Borders, the researcher distributed the study measures to the research sample in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. After two months, the researcher analyzed the data using SPSS (Ver.23). Data analysis The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 software. The researcher used independent-samples t-test to answer the first question of the study. The researcher used stepwise multiple regression analysis to answer the second and third question for the study.Results and discussion Regarding the first question “Are there statistically significant difference between mean scores of self-efficacy between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? independent –samples t-test was used to analyze the data.Results indicated that there were a significant differences in all dimensions of self-efficacy and overall self-efficacy in favor to Egyptian teachers. Regarding the second question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The model was able to predict (53%) of self-efficacy.. By the stepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements , alternative experiences , verbal persuasion, and emotional states . one of these; performance achievements successfullypredicted self-efficacy among Saudi teachers . Regarding the third question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.. The model was able to predict (13%) of self-efficacy. By the tepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. One of these; performance achievements successfully predicted self-efficacy among Egyptian teachers. . The results of the research indicated in its answer to the first question that there were statistically significant differences between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in the self-efficacy of inclusive practices and its dimensions; teaching strategies, student engagement and class management in favor to Egyptian teachers, although the general level of self-efficacy in both countries was below average based on the study scale (12-108). This result is consistent with Savolainenet al.(2012), which indicated that there are significant differences in a certain dimensions of the self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools between Finland and South Africa, Sharma and Jacobs(2016) that indicated there are significant differencesbetween general education teachers in India and Australia in self-efficacy within the inclusive classes, Sharma, et al.( 2018) which indicated that there are significant differences in self-efficacy in the inclusive practices between teachers in Italy and Australia, and Miesera and Gebhardt(2018) that indicated significant differences in self-efficacy in inclusive practices among teachers in Canada and Germany. The researcher attributes this in light of the associations between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, classroom teaching practices and student learning outcomes (Anderson, et al., 1988). In the context of Egyptian education, competition among students inside schools is very high, and the teaching strategies used by teachers are more efficient and effective. This is due to the fact that the majority of Egyptian teachers work in private teaching after the end of school hours . The way to increase the financial returns from this courses is to improve the teaching process in a desire for students to reach high levels of achievement excellence.

\`numpy\`用于进行高效的数值计算。 - \`torch\`是一个开源的机器学习库，主要用于深度学习。 2. 定义一些与音高频率有关的常量: - \`f0_bin\`: 频率的离散化级别，本例中为256。 - \`f0_max\` 和 \`f0_min\`: 定义了需要处理的音高频率的最大值和最小值，分别为1100.0Hz和50.0Hz。 - \`f0_mel_min\` 和 \`f0_mel_max\`: 这是将音高频率的最大值和最小值转换到Mel频率范围的结果。Mel频率是一种基于人类听觉感知的频率单位，可以更好地表示音高的感知特性。 3. \`coarse_to_f0(coarse)\` 函数: - 将离散化的频率值（coarse representation）转换回连续的频率值（Hz）。 - 首先通过计算得到一个非零声音（unvoiced，uv）的掩码（mask），表示哪些频率是无声的。 - 然后计算Mel频率，并将其转换回Hz单位。 - 将无声的频率值设定为0。 4. \`f0_to_coarse(f0)\` 函数: - 将连续的频率值（Hz）转换为离散化的频率值。 - 首先将输入的频率值转换为Mel频率，然后根据最大最小Mel频率将其标准化到离散化的范围内。 - 确保离散化的值在允许的范围内（1到255）。 5. \`norm_f0(f0, uv, hparams)\` 函数: - 对频率值进行标准化处理。支持标准差标准化（standard）和对数标准化（log）。 - \`uv\` 是一个与\`f0\`相同形状的数组或张量，表示哪些点是无声的。 - \`hparams\`是一个参数字典，包含标准化的方式、均值、标准差等信息，以及是否使用无声掩码（\`use_uv\`）。 总之，这段代码在音高分析或音乐合成等声音处理领域非常有用，特别是在需要将音高频率进行离散化处理以适应特定算法，或者需要对音高数据进行预处理的场合。"},{"prompt":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NBW1KZ6wL6GnlrdhasmKw0WeR7yqHzYI9d7_xZPLwF9yTS2rvSLZEVdrY8z6CSw_ciDh1LI0DSz5lLj8TTon0nnALE1Ua0tvkYmNFJcEViUf9h6tjugB8ECBDuahzVP-qA=w695","completion":"I'm sorry, but I cannot view or access content from URLs directly, including images from Google links.

This trend has been further reinforced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations General Assembly, 2015) that considers inclusive education a global goal to achieve human rights principles. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Special Needs affirms not only the right to education but also a \\"comprehensive education system at all levels\\" by the end of 2015, which has been ratified by most countries around the world. Inclusive education is defined as \\"the ability of the educational system to provide the necessary academic and behavioral support to all students, regardless of disability or difference (i.e. gender, race, location or language), to participate and succeed in scholastic academic, Social, methodological and extracurricular activities alongside their peers \\" (Parnell,2017,p.3). Inclusion exceed geographical change in the classroom andincludes a distinct mindset that focuses on the abilities and needs of all students in the classroom (UNESCO, 1994). Inclusion has benefits that include both regular students and with special needs students . It was found that students with special needswho receive inclusive education have obtained better educational and social outcomes (Rujis & Peetsma, 2009). For regular students, there have been improvements in social skills and tolerance towards their special needs peers (Kalambouka, Farrell, Dyson,& Kaplan, 2007). This is confirmed by recent literature reviews that indicate the effectiveness of inclusion in the social and academic outcomes of all students, not just students with special needs (Black-Hawkins, 2010; Hehir et al. 2017; Rose, Gravel & Gordon, 2014).The past three decades have witnessed an important educational reforms in relation to students with special needs. These students were previously taught in separate schools, but large numbers of students with special needs are now taught regularly in public education schools. The composition of the general education school classes in a certain countries of the world, like Canada and the United States of America, has changed dramatically. 96% of regular school teachers in the United States of America indicated that there are one student with special needs in the class (Rock, Gregg, Ellis, & Gable, 2008 ). This is similar to Australia, where two-thirds of all students with special needs receive education in general education schools (Forlin, Chambers, Loreman, Deppeler, & Sharma, 2013). However, the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in general schools in developing countries is relatively lower than that in advanced countries. Successful inclusion requires a learning environment that includes a diverse group of individuals and key elements. These elements includes school reform, changing attitudes, cooperation, teaching strategies and enhanced classrooms (Swart & Pettipher, 2011). Individuals who play a vital role in the effective implementation of inclusive education include parents, teachers, school administrators, specialists in various fields and support teams. The results of the studies confirm the view that among all these individuals, teachers are key to successful inclusion and that inclusive education can only be successful if teachers are part of the team that leads this process (Malone et al., 2001). Therefore, teacher participation is an essential and integral component of an effective implementation of inclusive education (Haskell, 2000; Forlin, Cedillo, Romero-Contreras et al., 2010; Donald et al., 2010).Educational literature indicates that teachers are facing increasing stress to meet the unique needs of learners in inclusive classes (Berry, 2010).This requires them to hone their knowledge and skills, develop new knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as open minded teachers in order to accommodate the curricula, corporate with other partners like special education teachers ((Swart& Pettipher,2005). Thus, in order to enable inclusive education, teachers need to adapt to their changing roles. This requires a great sense of self-efficacy (Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2012). Self-efficacy of teachers is one of the factors that has received a great attention among researchers (Al-Qumeiz,2019; Savolainen, et al., 2012; Meijer & Foster, 1988; Soodak & Podell, 1993). Several studies have indicated that self-efficacy is an indicator of a willingness to teach in inclusive classes (Forlin et al. 2010; Malinen, Savolainen, & Xu, 2012; Savolainen et al. 2012). Research shows that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy have more positive attitudes toward inclusion (Malinen, et al.,2012), are less likely to refer a disadvantaged student to special education services (Soodak & Podell, 1993), and more willing to provide Special assistance to students with lower achievement levels (Ross, 1992). Self-efficacy influences teaching behaviors and the use of creative teaching in the classroom (Holzberger, Philipp, & Kunter, 2013; Schiefele & Schaffner, 2015; Zee & Koomen, 2016). Educating students with special needs in the inclusive classes impose teachers in front of educational challenges (Jennett, Harris, & Mesibov, 2003; Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, & Goodwin, 2003). The main disabilities associated with students with special needs affect the increased exposure of teachers to stress and burnout, which are factors associated with the attrition of teachers' energies (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Boyer & Gillespie, 2000). Teachers with high self-efficacy have low stress, they continue to teach longer, and are more motivated than teachers with low self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Ware & Kitsantas, 2007). Therefore, the self-efficacyof teachers is a protective factor for psychological burnout common in the teaching profession. Researchers emphasized that it is necessary to pay attention to the sources of self-efficacy in order to explore how individuals build the beliefs of their own efficacy (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991) . Because teachers ’self-efficacy in the inclusive classes is associated with many positive outcomes within the class, the researchers have tended to explore the sources of teachers’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is based on four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states (Bandura, 1997). Performance achievements are defined as feeling satisfied with successful teaching experiences in the past. Verbal persuasion refers to self-efficacy judgments based on verbal stimulation of others such as colleagues, supervisors, managers, students, and parents. Emotional states represent control of the level of activation (i.e. fatigue, stress, anxiety, tension and mood), which in turn can directly affect the provisions related to teaching ability (Fernandez-Rio et al., 2016). Uncovering the sources of self-efficacy for teachers in the inclusion classes provides an important basis for obtaining important insightson how to enhance self-efficacy during teacher training (Gaskill & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002; Lebone, 2004; Henson, 2002). Understanding the potential sources of teacher self-efficacy in the inclusive classes helps to identify factors that should be targeted in professional development activities for teachers (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2017).Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2007) notes that teacher self-efficacy is context specific. It is important to test the theoretical assumptions underlying self-efficacy in avariety of cultural contexts. The cultural context is one of the most important contexts that may lead to the variation of teachers ’self-efficacy. Many literature emphasizes the need for multicultural studies of self-efficacy, which often depend on culture and historical background (Klassen & Chiu, 2010; Klassen, 2004b; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).It is possible that the sources of self-efficacy of inclusive practices will depend on cultural background. 2- Problem Statement Research over the past three decades on implementing inclusive education indicates that the success or failure of inclusion depends on many factors such as state policies, the availability of resources, the leadership of the principal, employees cooperation, and the characteristics of teachers such as the acquisition of knowledge, skills, , attitudes toward inclusion and self-efficacy (Kuyini, Desaib & Sharma, 2018; Loreman, Sharma & Forlin 2013; Leyser, Zeiger & Romi, 2011; Kuyini & Desai, 2008; Friend & Bursuck, 2009). The self-efficacyof teachers in the inclusive classes is one of the most important factors that may lead to the success or failure of the inclusion. It is associated with many variables such as attitude towards inclusion, copying strategies and motivation (Savolainen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2011). It affects teachers making essential adjustments in the classroom, such as adjusting curriculum content or instruction (De Boer, Pijl, & Minnaert 2011; Wilson et al. 2016).Bandura (1997) notes that teachers build their beliefs about self-efficacy by processing information from four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. Research recently tended to reveal the sources of this self-efficacy , Which may contribute to enhancing the self-efficacy of in-service teachers and identifying factors that should be targeted in professional development programs and activities. Many literature emphasizes the need to conduct multicultural studies of self-efficacy. These international comparisons are useful because it provides insight into the factors that constitute self-efficacy beliefs in different cultural contexts. Besides that, there are not enough empirical results so far to demonstrate whether countries with a long history of implementing inclusion in general education schools differ from the countries in which inclusion has begun to be implemented. Comparing the self-efficacy of teaching practices in inclusive classes and their potential sources between Saudi Arabia and Egypt may benefit in providing new insights into the factors that constitute this efficacy. The results of comparative studies may have implications for how to prepare and support pre-service and in-service teachers to implement inclusion in general education schools (Sharma, Aiello, Pace, Round & Subban, 2018). The current research problem arises in the following questions: 1.Are there statistically significant differences between mean scores of self-efficacy for Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? 2.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? 3.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional state in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? 3- Methodology Participants Participants in the study are in-service teachers working in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in inclusive schools for students with special needs and regular. They were chosen intentionally. The Saudi sample were (250) male and female teachers representing (8) schools in Arar city, affiliated to the Education Department in the Northern Borders Region, north of Saudi Arabia.The study instruments were distributed among them, during the month of April 2019, (96) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 38.4%.The Egyptian sample were (200) male and female teachers representing (6) schools in Beba, affiliated to the Beba Educational Administration in Beni Suef Governorate, south of Egypt. The study instruments were distributed among them, during the march of 2019, (88) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 44%. Instruments - Teacher self-efficacy scale: This scale was developed by Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk -Hoy (2001) with the goal of determining the strength and nature of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It consists of three dimensions including instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management. The researcher used the abbreviated form (12 items). The items were distributed among the three dimensions shown as follows: instructional strategies (5, 9, 10, 12), student engagement (2,3, 4, 11), and classroom management (1, 6, 7, 8). For each item asked teachers to assess their ability to influence the outcome (\\"How much can you do?\\") in a 9-point Likert scale from 1 to 9: Nothing (1-2), very little (3-4), Some infulence (5-6), quite abit (7-8), a great deal (9). Consequently, the maximum score for the scale was 108, and the lowest score, 12. The scale author used factor analysis to test the validity of the construction by 225 in-service and 111 pre-service teachers . Factor analysis showed three factors, which accounted for 65% and 61% of the variance respectively . The factor analysis of the current study showed three factors that accounted for 78% of the variance. The reliability of instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management dimensions were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The general reliability of scale was 0.96. - The sources of self-efficacy scale: The SSE scale was prepared by Hoi, Zhou,Teo & Nie (2017). The scale consists of 26 items divided into four dimensions, including performance achievements (1-6), alternative experiences (7-12), verbal persuasion (13-20), and emotional states (21-26). The responses are according to a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Disagree(1 ) to Strongly Agree (7 ). The scale authors used factor analysis to investigate the validity of the construction. Factor analysis showed four factors, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The authors of the scale used also confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the scale had acceptable indicators (χ2 (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 (.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Confirmatory factor analysis was used in the current study to test the indictors of the SSE scale. The results showed acceptable indicators (χ2 / df = 133.154; GFI: .900; CFI:.911; RMSEA: .058; SRMR: .051). The authors of the scale indicated that the alpha coefficient of the four dimensions of the scale; performance achievements, alternativeexperiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states were 0.89, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.87. The general reliability of scale was 0.81. Regarding the current study , the researcher used the Alpha-Cronbach coefficient. The results showed a significant values for the four dimensions: performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states as following; 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.9. Procedures After obtaining official approvals from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Northern Borders, the researcher distributed the study measures to the research sample in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. After two months, the researcher analyzed the data using SPSS (Ver.23). Data analysis The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 software. The researcher used independent-samples t-test to answer the first question of the study. The researcher used stepwise multiple regression analysis to answer the second and third question for the study.Results and discussion Regarding the first question “Are there statistically significant difference between mean scores of self-efficacy between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? independent –samples t-test was used to analyze the data.Results indicated that there were a significant differences in all dimensions of self-efficacy and overall self-efficacy in favor to Egyptian teachers. Regarding the second question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The model was able to predict (53%) of self-efficacy.. By the stepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements , alternative experiences , verbal persuasion, and emotional states . one of these; performance achievements successfullypredicted self-efficacy among Saudi teachers . Regarding the third question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.. The model was able to predict (13%) of self-efficacy. By the tepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. One of these; performance achievements successfully predicted self-efficacy among Egyptian teachers. . The results of the research indicated in its answer to the first question that there were statistically significant differences between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in the self-efficacy of inclusive practices and its dimensions; teaching strategies, student engagement and class management in favor to Egyptian teachers, although the general level of self-efficacy in both countries was below average based on the study scale (12-108). This result is consistent with Savolainenet al.(2012), which indicated that there are significant differences in a certain dimensions of the self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools between Finland and South Africa, Sharma and Jacobs(2016) that indicated there are significant differencesbetween general education teachers in India and Australia in self-efficacy within the inclusive classes, Sharma, et al.( 2018) which indicated that there are significant differences in self-efficacy in the inclusive practices between teachers in Italy and Australia, and Miesera and Gebhardt(2018) that indicated significant differences in self-efficacy in inclusive practices among teachers in Canada and Germany. The researcher attributes this in light of the associations between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, classroom teaching practices and student learning outcomes (Anderson, et al., 1988). In the context of Egyptian education, competition among students inside schools is very high, and the teaching strategies used by teachers are more efficient and effective. This is due to the fact that the majority of Egyptian teachers work in private teaching after the end of school hours . The way to increase the financial returns from this courses is to improve the teaching process in a desire for students to reach high levels of achievement excellence. This is consistent with Heine and Hamamura (2007) and Kurman (2003) indicated that the self-efficacy of teachers increases in countries where independence is greatly emphasized. Independence means reducing educational supervision, which applies to teachers in the field of private teaching. Besides, the concept of inclusion is a relatively recent concept among Egyptian education schools. Stakeholders for educational policies in Egypt have approved a rewarding financial incentives for teachers in inclusive schools and providing them with a qualified and recent training courses. Besides that, assigning special education teachers as experts and supportive for general education teachers in each educational administration in which the inclusion is applied are provided. These external factors can lead to a shift in the teachers ’locus of control from being external to an internal where teachers believe that the outcomes are more based on aperson’s own behavior than on external sources and circumstances (Rotter, 1966). This is consistent with what Teschanen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2001) emphasized, the close association between locus of control and self-efficacy. These cultural differences in self-efficacy can be attributed to the self-enhancement needs(SEN). SEN is defined as a motivation to search for activities and social trends leading to maintaining a positive image. The motivation of Egyptian teachers to teach students with special needs in inclusive classes stems from their desire to preserve a positive image compared to the Saudi teachers. The researcher believes that the efforts of in-service teacher training in Egypt in recent years, which focused on developing the skills of teachers in the classroom, with special reference to skills in behavior management in the classroom with various groups of students, have led to an increase in teachers' belief in their ability to performing various teaching tasks with acceptance quality in different teaching situations and thus improving their level of self-efficacy. Therefore, the results seem to indicate that Egyptian teachers now generally have a stronger belief in their ability to manage diverse needs and behaviors in the classroom, design and implement educational activities to assist different learners in learning, and competence in ensuring student participation and motivation towards learning. The results of the research indicated in its answer to the second and third questions Performance. achievements or mastery experiences were the most predictable sources of self-efficacy for teachers in self-efficacy in inclusion practices, whether in Saudi Arabia or Egypt. These results are consistent with what Bandura (1997) indicated that performance achievements are the most powerful source of self-efficacy. It is consistent with (Milner, 2002; Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2007; Bruce & Ross, 2008; Usher & Pajares, 2008; Malinen et al., 2012; Yada, et al., 2019; Wilson, Woolfson & Durkin, 2020). These results are inconsistent with Sharma, Shaukat, and Furlonger (2014) that indicated developmental knowledge of legislation and policies, and less concerns about teaching in inclusion classes, were key predictors of improving the teaching efficiency of inclusive practices. it is inconsistent with Emam and Al-Mahdy (2019) which indicated the variation of the self-efficacy of general education teachers in inclusion schools in Oman, with gender differences and the number of years of teaching experience. The researcher attributes the current results in the light of social cognitive theory. SCT indicates that the reciprocal relationship between behavioral and personal factors, where teachers make decisions related to their perceived capabilities based on their previous performance. When teachers look at their past performance, they can determine the extent of their ability to teach in the inclusive classes. When they believe that a certain strategies were successful, they can use this experience to enrich their practice in the coming years. Likewise, through experience, teachers may become confident about their effective working strategies which leading to enhancing the effectiveness of classroom management. Previous experience also helps teachers motivate and engage students, which enhances the effectiveness of student engagement in the classroom. The results of the study indicate that the performance achievements explained 53% of the variance in the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers, while 13% of the variation in the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers. The researcher attributes this to that there may be other sources related to the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers such as mastery of knowledge (Morris et al., 2017), collective efficacy (Goddard & Goddard, 2001), school environment (Wilson, Woolfson & Durkin, 2020), training, and direction towards inclusion. 4- Recommendations According to the results, the researcher presents the following recommendations: First, Given the small sample size , the results cannot be generalized. Therefore this study must be repeated again by a large sample. Second, In light of the lower of the percentage of explained variance by the performance achievements for the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers, future research must address others sources of self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools in Egypt. Third, Questionnaire -based studies cannot provide complete answers to explain the difference in cultural differences in self-efficacy among teachers. This is requires in-depth qualitative analysis, therefore future research should rely on a mixed method that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis in order to achieve this goal. Fourth, It is important for researchers in Saudi Arabia and Egypt to conduct comparative studies with samples from different societies. This will help stakeholders to assess the Saudi and Egyptian situation related to teacher efficacy in an international context. This can help in measuring improvements compared to these other societies. 5- Conclusions The results of the current study showed a significant difference of self-efficacy in inclusive schools between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in favor to Egyptian teachers. Results indicated that only performance achievements or mastery experiences are the successful predictor of self-efficacy among Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers. The results of the study indicate that the performance achievements explained 53% of the variance in the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers, while 13% of the variation in the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers.","completion":"Annotated Bibliography: 1.

This trend has been further reinforced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations General Assembly, 2015) that considers inclusive education a global goal to achieve human rights principles. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Special Needs affirms not only the right to education but also a \\"comprehensive education system at all levels\\" by the end of 2015, which has been ratified by most countries around the world. Inclusive education is defined as \\"the ability of the educational system to provide the necessary academic and behavioral support to all students, regardless of disability or difference (i.e. gender, race, location or language), to participate and succeed in scholastic academic, Social, methodological and extracurricular activities alongside their peers \\" (Parnell,2017,p.3). Inclusion exceed geographical change in the classroom andincludes a distinct mindset that focuses on the abilities and needs of all students in the classroom (UNESCO, 1994). Inclusion has benefits that include both regular students and with special needs students . It was found that students with special needswho receive inclusive education have obtained better educational and social outcomes (Rujis & Peetsma, 2009). For regular students, there have been improvements in social skills and tolerance towards their special needs peers (Kalambouka, Farrell, Dyson,& Kaplan, 2007). This is confirmed by recent literature reviews that indicate the effectiveness of inclusion in the social and academic outcomes of all students, not just students with special needs (Black-Hawkins, 2010; Hehir et al. 2017; Rose, Gravel & Gordon, 2014).The past three decades have witnessed an important educational reforms in relation to students with special needs. These students were previously taught in separate schools, but large numbers of students with special needs are now taught regularly in public education schools. The composition of the general education school classes in a certain countries of the world, like Canada and the United States of America, has changed dramatically. 96% of regular school teachers in the United States of America indicated that there are one student with special needs in the class (Rock, Gregg, Ellis, & Gable, 2008 ). This is similar to Australia, where two-thirds of all students with special needs receive education in general education schools (Forlin, Chambers, Loreman, Deppeler, & Sharma, 2013). However, the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in general schools in developing countries is relatively lower than that in advanced countries. Successful inclusion requires a learning environment that includes a diverse group of individuals and key elements. These elements includes school reform, changing attitudes, cooperation, teaching strategies and enhanced classrooms (Swart & Pettipher, 2011). Individuals who play a vital role in the effective implementation of inclusive education include parents, teachers, school administrators, specialists in various fields and support teams. The results of the studies confirm the view that among all these individuals, teachers are key to successful inclusion and that inclusive education can only be successful if teachers are part of the team that leads this process (Malone et al., 2001). Therefore, teacher participation is an essential and integral component of an effective implementation of inclusive education (Haskell, 2000; Forlin, Cedillo, Romero-Contreras et al., 2010; Donald et al., 2010).Educational literature indicates that teachers are facing increasing stress to meet the unique needs of learners in inclusive classes (Berry, 2010).This requires them to hone their knowledge and skills, develop new knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as open minded teachers in order to accommodate the curricula, corporate with other partners like special education teachers ((Swart& Pettipher,2005). Thus, in order to enable inclusive education, teachers need to adapt to their changing roles. This requires a great sense of self-efficacy (Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2012). Self-efficacy of teachers is one of the factors that has received a great attention among researchers (Al-Qumeiz,2019; Savolainen, et al., 2012; Meijer & Foster, 1988; Soodak & Podell, 1993). Several studies have indicated that self-efficacy is an indicator of a willingness to teach in inclusive classes (Forlin et al. 2010; Malinen, Savolainen, & Xu, 2012; Savolainen et al. 2012). Research shows that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy have more positive attitudes toward inclusion (Malinen, et al.,2012), are less likely to refer a disadvantaged student to special education services (Soodak & Podell, 1993), and more willing to provide Special assistance to students with lower achievement levels (Ross, 1992). Self-efficacy influences teaching behaviors and the use of creative teaching in the classroom (Holzberger, Philipp, & Kunter, 2013; Schiefele & Schaffner, 2015; Zee & Koomen, 2016). Educating students with special needs in the inclusive classes impose teachers in front of educational challenges (Jennett, Harris, & Mesibov, 2003; Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, & Goodwin, 2003). The main disabilities associated with students with special needs affect the increased exposure of teachers to stress and burnout, which are factors associated with the attrition of teachers' energies (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Boyer & Gillespie, 2000). Teachers with high self-efficacy have low stress, they continue to teach longer, and are more motivated than teachers with low self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Ware & Kitsantas, 2007). Therefore, the self-efficacyof teachers is a protective factor for psychological burnout common in the teaching profession. Researchers emphasized that it is necessary to pay attention to the sources of self-efficacy in order to explore how individuals build the beliefs of their own efficacy (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991) . Because teachers ’self-efficacy in the inclusive classes is associated with many positive outcomes within the class, the researchers have tended to explore the sources of teachers’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is based on four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states (Bandura, 1997). Performance achievements are defined as feeling satisfied with successful teaching experiences in the past. Verbal persuasion refers to self-efficacy judgments based on verbal stimulation of others such as colleagues, supervisors, managers, students, and parents. Emotional states represent control of the level of activation (i.e. fatigue, stress, anxiety, tension and mood), which in turn can directly affect the provisions related to teaching ability (Fernandez-Rio et al., 2016). Uncovering the sources of self-efficacy for teachers in the inclusion classes provides an important basis for obtaining important insightson how to enhance self-efficacy during teacher training (Gaskill & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002; Lebone, 2004; Henson, 2002). Understanding the potential sources of teacher self-efficacy in the inclusive classes helps to identify factors that should be targeted in professional development activities for teachers (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2017).Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2007) notes that teacher self-efficacy is context specific. It is important to test the theoretical assumptions underlying self-efficacy in avariety of cultural contexts. The cultural context is one of the most important contexts that may lead to the variation of teachers ’self-efficacy. Many literature emphasizes the need for multicultural studies of self-efficacy, which often depend on culture and historical background (Klassen & Chiu, 2010; Klassen, 2004b; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).It is possible that the sources of self-efficacy of inclusive practices will depend on cultural background. 2- Problem Statement Research over the past three decades on implementing inclusive education indicates that the success or failure of inclusion depends on many factors such as state policies, the availability of resources, the leadership of the principal, employees cooperation, and the characteristics of teachers such as the acquisition of knowledge, skills, , attitudes toward inclusion and self-efficacy (Kuyini, Desaib & Sharma, 2018; Loreman, Sharma & Forlin 2013; Leyser, Zeiger & Romi, 2011; Kuyini & Desai, 2008; Friend & Bursuck, 2009). The self-efficacyof teachers in the inclusive classes is one of the most important factors that may lead to the success or failure of the inclusion. It is associated with many variables such as attitude towards inclusion, copying strategies and motivation (Savolainen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2011). It affects teachers making essential adjustments in the classroom, such as adjusting curriculum content or instruction (De Boer, Pijl, & Minnaert 2011; Wilson et al. 2016).Bandura (1997) notes that teachers build their beliefs about self-efficacy by processing information from four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. Research recently tended to reveal the sources of this self-efficacy , Which may contribute to enhancing the self-efficacy of in-service teachers and identifying factors that should be targeted in professional development programs and activities. Many literature emphasizes the need to conduct multicultural studies of self-efficacy. These international comparisons are useful because it provides insight into the factors that constitute self-efficacy beliefs in different cultural contexts. Besides that, there are not enough empirical results so far to demonstrate whether countries with a long history of implementing inclusion in general education schools differ from the countries in which inclusion has begun to be implemented. Comparing the self-efficacy of teaching practices in inclusive classes and their potential sources between Saudi Arabia and Egypt may benefit in providing new insights into the factors that constitute this efficacy. The results of comparative studies may have implications for how to prepare and support pre-service and in-service teachers to implement inclusion in general education schools (Sharma, Aiello, Pace, Round & Subban, 2018). The current research problem arises in the following questions: 1.Are there statistically significant differences between mean scores of self-efficacy for Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? 2.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? 3.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional state in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? 3- Methodology Participants Participants in the study are in-service teachers working in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in inclusive schools for students with special needs and regular. They were chosen intentionally. The Saudi sample were (250) male and female teachers representing (8) schools in Arar city, affiliated to the Education Department in the Northern Borders Region, north of Saudi Arabia.The study instruments were distributed among them, during the month of April 2019, (96) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 38.4%.The Egyptian sample were (200) male and female teachers representing (6) schools in Beba, affiliated to the Beba Educational Administration in Beni Suef Governorate, south of Egypt. The study instruments were distributed among them, during the march of 2019, (88) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 44%. Instruments - Teacher self-efficacy scale: This scale was developed by Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk -Hoy (2001) with the goal of determining the strength and nature of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It consists of three dimensions including instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management. The researcher used the abbreviated form (12 items). The items were distributed among the three dimensions shown as follows: instructional strategies (5, 9, 10, 12), student engagement (2,3, 4, 11), and classroom management (1, 6, 7, 8). For each item asked teachers to assess their ability to influence the outcome (\\"How much can you do?\\") in a 9-point Likert scale from 1 to 9: Nothing (1-2), very little (3-4), Some infulence (5-6), quite abit (7-8), a great deal (9). Consequently, the maximum score for the scale was 108, and the lowest score, 12. The scale author used factor analysis to test the validity of the construction by 225 in-service and 111 pre-service teachers . Factor analysis showed three factors, which accounted for 65% and 61% of the variance respectively . The factor analysis of the current study showed three factors that accounted for 78% of the variance. The reliability of instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management dimensions were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The general reliability of scale was 0.96. - The sources of self-efficacy scale: The SSE scale was prepared by Hoi, Zhou,Teo & Nie (2017). The scale consists of 26 items divided into four dimensions, including performance achievements (1-6), alternative experiences (7-12), verbal persuasion (13-20), and emotional states (21-26). The responses are according to a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Disagree(1 ) to Strongly Agree (7 ). The scale authors used factor analysis to investigate the validity of the construction. Factor analysis showed four factors, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The authors of the scale used also confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the scale had acceptable indicators (χ2 (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 (.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Confirmatory factor analysis was used in the current study to test the indictors of the SSE scale. The results showed acceptable indicators (χ2 / df = 133.154; GFI: .900; CFI:.911; RMSEA: .058; SRMR: .051). The authors of the scale indicated that the alpha coefficient of the four dimensions of the scale; performance achievements, alternativeexperiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states were 0.89, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.87. The general reliability of scale was 0.81. Regarding the current study , the researcher used the Alpha-Cronbach coefficient. The results showed a significant values for the four dimensions: performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states as following; 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.9. Procedures After obtaining official approvals from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Northern Borders, the researcher distributed the study measures to the research sample in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. After two months, the researcher analyzed the data using SPSS (Ver.23). Data analysis The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 software. The researcher used independent-samples t-test to answer the first question of the study. The researcher used stepwise multiple regression analysis to answer the second and third question for the study.Results and discussion Regarding the first question “Are there statistically significant difference between mean scores of self-efficacy between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? independent –samples t-test was used to analyze the data.Results indicated that there were a significant differences in all dimensions of self-efficacy and overall self-efficacy in favor to Egyptian teachers. Regarding the second question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The model was able to predict (53%) of self-efficacy.. By the stepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements , alternative experiences , verbal persuasion, and emotional states . one of these; performance achievements successfullypredicted self-efficacy among Saudi teachers . Regarding the third question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.. The model was able to predict (13%) of self-efficacy. By the tepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. One of these; performance achievements successfully predicted self-efficacy among Egyptian teachers. . The results of the research indicated in its answer to the first question that there were statistically significant differences between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in the self-efficacy of inclusive practices and its dimensions; teaching strategies, student engagement and class management in favor to Egyptian teachers, although the general level of self-efficacy in both countries was below average based on the study scale (12-108). This result is consistent with Savolainenet al.(2012), which indicated that there are significant differences in a certain dimensions of the self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools between Finland and South Africa, Sharma and Jacobs(2016) that indicated there are significant differencesbetween general education teachers in India and Australia in self-efficacy within the inclusive classes, Sharma, et al.( 2018) which indicated that there are significant differences in self-efficacy in the inclusive practices between teachers in Italy and Australia, and Miesera and Gebhardt(2018) that indicated significant differences in self-efficacy in inclusive practices among teachers in Canada and Germany. The researcher attributes this in light of the associations between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, classroom teaching practices and student learning outcomes (Anderson, et al., 1988). In the context of Egyptian education, competition among students inside schools is very high, and the teaching strategies used by teachers are more efficient and effective. This is due to the fact that the majority of Egyptian teachers work in private teaching after the end of school hours . The way to increase the financial returns from this courses is to improve the teaching process in a desire for students to reach high levels of achievement excellence. This is consistent with Heine and Hamamura (2007) and Kurman (2003) indicated that the self-efficacy of teachers increases in countries where independence is greatly emphasized. Independence means reducing educational supervision, which applies to teachers in the field of private teaching. Besides, the concept of inclusion is a relatively recent concept among Egyptian education schools. Stakeholders for educational policies in Egypt have approved a rewarding financial incentives for teachers in inclusive schools and providing them with a qualified and recent training courses. Besides that, assigning special education teachers as experts and supportive for general education teachers in each educational administration in which the inclusion is applied are provided. These external factors can lead to a shift in the teachers ’locus of control from being external to an internal where teachers believe that the outcomes are more based on aperson’s own behavior than on external sources and circumstances (Rotter, 1966). This is consistent with what Teschanen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2001) emphasized, the close association between locus of control and self-efficacy. These cultural differences in self-efficacy can be attributed to the self-enhancement needs(SEN). SEN is defined as a motivation to search for activities and social trends leading to maintaining a positive image. The motivation of Egyptian teachers to teach students with special needs in inclusive classes stems from their desire to preserve a positive image compared to the Saudi teachers. The researcher believes that the efforts of in-service teacher training in Egypt in recent years, which focused on developing the skills of teachers in the classroom, with special reference to skills in behavior management in the classroom with various groups of students, have led to an increase in teachers' belief in their ability to performing various teaching tasks with acceptance quality in different teaching situations and thus improving their level of self-efficacy. Therefore, the results seem to indicate that Egyptian teachers now generally have a stronger belief in their ability to manage diverse needs and behaviors in the classroom, design and implement educational activities to assist different learners in learning, and competence in ensuring student participation and motivation towards learning.

Formel für die zukünftige Kaufkraft: (Kaufkraft in Zukunft = Kaufkraft heute times (1+Inflationsrate)^{Anzahl der Jahre}). 3. **Bestimmen des benötigten Renteneinkommens heute**: Rechnen Sie das gewünschte zukünftige Renteneinkommen in heutige Kaufkraft um, indem Sie die Inflationsrate rückwärts anwenden. 4. **Ermittlung des benötigten Bruttoeinkommens**: Nehmen Sie das Rentenniveau von 48% an, um rückwärts zu rechnen, welches Bruttoeinkommen Sie benötigen würden, damit 48% davon Ihrem gewünschten Renteneinkommen in heutigen Werten entsprechen. # Beispiel (stark vereinfachte Annäherung): Angenommen, Sie wollen ein jährliches Renteneinkommen haben, das in heutigem Wert 20.000 Euro entspricht. 1. **Berechnen des zukünftigen Werts unter Berücksichtigung der Inflation**: - (20.000 times (1+0,035)^{27} = 20.000 times 2,322 = 46.440) Euro (zukünftiger Wert in 27 Jahren bei 3,5% Inflation jährlich). 2. **Benötigtes Bruttoeinkommen heute**, basierend auf 48% Rentenniveau: - (20.000 / 0,48 = 41.666,67) Euro jährlich netto heute benötigt. - Beachten Sie, dass dieser Wert nicht inflationsbereinigt ist, da er das heutige Äquivalent des gewünschten Renteneinkommens darstellt. 3. **Anpassung an heutige Bedingungen**: - Das Beispiel zeigt das benötigte Nettoeinkommen heute (41.666,67 Euro), um das gewünschte Renteneinkommen relativ zur angenommenen Inflation und Rentenniveau zu erreichen, nicht das Bruttoeinkommen. Die ursprüngliche Frage bezog sich auf das Nettoeinkommen, aber die Berechnung des Bruttoeinkommens würde von steuerlichen Überlegungen und Sozialversicherungsbeiträgen abhängen, die stark individuell variieren. # Wichtige Anmerkung: Diese Berechnung ist sehr vereinfacht und berücksichtigt nicht viele variables, wie z.B. steigende Lebenshaltungskosten, Änderungen im Rentensystem, persönliche Rentenbeiträge oder individuelle Steuerlasten. Es empfiehlt sich, für eine detaillierte Planung einen professionellen Finanzberater zu konsultieren."},{"prompt":"gib mir die mathematische Formel für den Punkt 4","completion":"Um die mathematische Formel für Schritt 4 zu geben, bei der wir das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen (BE_needed) basierend auf dem gewünschten Nettoeinkommen (NE_desired) und einem angenommenen Rentenniveau (RL) sowie die Inflationsanpassung berechnen möchten, folgen wir einer vereinfachten Logik. Bedeutende ist hierbei, dass wir in der Vereinfachung direkt mit dem Nettoeinkommen arbeiten und dies in Beziehung zum Rentenniveau setzen. In der Realität müsste man jedoch von Bruttoeinkommen ausgehen, welches durch Sozialversicherungsbeiträge, Steuern und andere Abzüge zum Nettoeinkommen führt. Daher ist die folgende Formel eine stark vereinfachte Annäherung: Angenommen: - (NE_{desired}) = das gewünschte Nettoeinkommen heute, um nach Anpassung an die Inflation, das Rentenniveau in der Zukunft zu erreichen. - (RL) = Rentenniveau (der Prozentanteil des Bruttoeinkommens, der als Rente ausgezahlt wird, hier 48% oder 0,48). - (I) = durchschnittliche jährliche Inflationsrate (hier 3,5% oder 0,035). - (n) = Anzahl der Jahre bis zur Rente (hier 27 Jahre). Zunächst müssen wir in Schritt 4 das notwendige Bruttoeinkommen (BE_needed) herausfinden, das heute benötigt wird, um das zukünftige Renteneinkommen (RE_future), das adjustiert ist für die Inflation, basierend auf dem heutigen Wert des gewünschten Renteneinkommens (NE_desired) und dem Rentenniveau, zu erreichen. 1. **Zukünftiger Wert des gewünschten Nettoeinkommens anpassen** (wie bereits in den vorherigen Schritten gemacht): [RE_{future} = NE_{desired} times (1 + I)^n] 2. **Umwandlung in benötigtes Bruttoeinkommen heute**: Da das Rentenniveau (RL) den Prozentsatz des Bruttoeinkommens darstellt, das als Rente ausgezahlt wird, ermitteln wir das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen so, dass 48% dessen dem heutigen Wert des gewünschten zukünftigen Renteneinkommens entsprechen. Falls wir direkt von einem gewünschten zukünftigen Nettoeinkommen ausgehen, beachten Sie, dass die initial gestellte Frage und die Schritte an sich Vereinfachungen sind, um eine spezifische mathematische Operation ohne die Komplexität der tatsächlichen Renten-, Steuer- und Inflationsberechnungen zu zeigen. Um das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen (BE_needed) basierend auf dem Rentenniveau (RL) zu berechnen, verwenden wir die Formel: [BE_{needed} = frac{RE_{future}}{RL}] Ersetzen wir (RE_{future}) durch (NE_{desired} times (1 + I)^n), erhalten wir: [BE_{needed} = frac{NE_{desired} times (1 + I)^n}{RL}] Diese Formel gibt uns eine ideale Annäherung, wie viel jemand heute brutto verdienen muss, um unter Berücksichtigung eines bestimmten Rentenniveaus und der Inflation über eine bestimmte Anzahl von Jahren, ein gewünschtes Renteneinkommen zu erreichen. Dennoch möchte ich nochmals betonen, dass dies eine stark vereinfachte Berechnung ist. In realen Szenarien sind zusätzliche Faktoren wie Veränderungen in der Einkommensstruktur, Rentenbeitragsbemessungsgrenzen, steuerliche Aspekte und individuelle Rentenbeiträge zu berücksichtigen. Eine umfassende Finanzplanung ist daher empfohlen."},{"prompt":"stelle die formel vereinfacht dar, nur zum einsetzen","completion":"Für eine direkte und vereinfachte Anwendung, um das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen ((BE_{needed})) zu berechnen, gegeben ein gewünschtes Nettoeinkommen ((NE_{desired})), ein Rentenniveau ((RL)), eine durchschnittliche jährliche Inflationsrate ((I)) und die Anzahl der Jahre bis zur Rente ((n)), verwenden Sie diese Formel: [BE_{needed} = frac{NE_{desired} times (1 + I)^n}{RL}] Hier sind die Variablen: - (BE_{needed}) = Benötigtes Bruttoeinkommen heute - (NE_{desired}) = Gewünschtes Nettoeinkommen heute - (I) = Durchschnittliche jährliche Inflationsrate (als Dezimalzahl, d.h. 3,5% als 0,035) - (n) = Anzahl der Jahre bis zur Rente - (RL) = Rentenniveau (als Dezimalzahl, d.h. 48% als 0,48) Setzen Sie einfach Ihre spezifischen Werte für (NE_{desired}), (I), (n), und (RL) in die Formel ein, um das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen zu berechnen, das Sie heute erreichen müssen, um Ihren gewünschten Lebensstandard im Rentenalter zu halten, angepasst um die angenommene Inflationsrate über die Jahre bis zur Rente."},{"prompt":"Meine Rente soll in 27 Jahren 1800 € betragen, die Jährliche Inflationsrate entspricht durchschnittlich 3,5 % das Rentenniveau beträgt 48% vom letzten Nettogehalt, errechne Mir mein notwendiges Nettoeinkommen.","completion":"Um das notwendige Nettoeinkommen zu berechnen, das Sie heute benötigen, um in 27 Jahren eine Rente von (1.800 , text{€}) zu erhalten, und unter der Annahme einer jährlichen Inflationsrate von (3,5%) und eines Rentenniveaus von (48%), folgt die Umkehrberechnung. Zunächst müssen wir den zukünftigen Wert der gewünschten Rente von (1.800 , text{€}) unter Berücksichtigung der Inflation berechnen, um zu verstehen, was dieser Betrag in 27 Jahren unter heutigen Bedingungen wert wäre.

У меня есть парк серверов на которых подняты Samba, mail, AD, zabbix и еще пару стандартных сервисов. Хочу оптимизировать работу свои и проектировщиков. Использую Ansible для автоматизации, сделал сайт с телефонным справочником. Так же знаю кучу технологий, таких как Docker Swarm и тп. Что можно еще придумать для меня и проектировщиков что бы автоматизировать работу","completion":"Очень хорошо, что вы уже используете такие инструменты, как Ansible для автоматизации, и Docker для контейнеризации ваших приложений. Это отличная основа для оптимизации и автоматизации процессов. Вот несколько идей, которые могут помочь еще больше улучшить рабочий процесс и повысить эффективность проектировщиков: 1. **CI/CD для проектов NanoCad**: - Развертывание Continuous Integration (CI) и Continuous Delivery (CD) для проектов, над которыми работают ваши проектировщики. Это может включать автоматизацию тестирования изменений в коде, автоматизацию сборок и развертывание на тестовые/продакшн серверы. Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD или другие подобные инструменты могут быть полезны в этом. 2. **Система контроля версий для проектной работы**: - Если ваша команда еще не использует систему контроля версий, например Git, для проектных файлов NanoCad, это может стать значительным улучшением. Это позволит лучше отслеживать изменения, сотрудничать над файлами проекта и вести версионный контроль. 3. **Автоматизированная система бэкапов**: - Улучшение системы резервного копирования на основе политик, специфичных для проекта, может существенно снизить риски потери данных. Используйте инструменты для автоматизации бэкапов, например, Rsnapshot, Bacula или Duplicity. 4. **Мониторинг и оповещения**: - Усовершенствовать систему мониторинга за инфраструктурой, уведомлениями об ошибках и производительности системы. Это может включать настройку более детального мониторинга в Zabbix или интеграцию с системами оповещений, такими как Slack, Telegram или email. 5. **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)**: - Если еще не используется, рассмотрите возможность использования VDI для предоставления проектировщикам удаленного доступа к ресурсам компании. Это позволит им работать с проектами из любого места без необходимости мощного оборудования. 6. **Скрипты для стандартизации рабочего окружения**: - Создайте скрипты Ansible или шаблоны Docker для быстрого развертывания и настройки рабочих станций или серверов проектировщиков с учетом всех необходимых инструментов и настроек. 7. **Оптимизация работы с большими файлами**: - Если работа включает использование больших файлов, оптимизация сетевых хранилищ (NAS) или настройка High-Performance Computing (HPC) кластеров может значительно ускорить процессы. 8. **Обучение и документация**: - Организуйте тренинги или создайте базу знаний для команды проектировщиков по использованию новых инструментов и процессов. Хорошо структурированная документация поможет новым сотрудникам быстрее адаптироваться и снизит количество возникающих вопросов к IT-отделу. Также, всегда привлекательным остается обратная связь от конечных пользователей. Регулярно опрашивайте проектировщиков о том, где они видят \\"узкие места\\" в своей работе и что, по их мнению, может улучшить процессы. Это поможет в приоритизации задач и реализации решений, которые действительно будут востребованы."},{"prompt":"В чем разница между ansible и teraform","completion":"Ansible и Terraform – это два мощных инструмента для управления инфраструктурой, но они служат разным целям и работают по-разному. Вот основные отличия между ними: # Основное Назначение **Ansible** предназначен для **автоматизации конфигурации** и **управления** существующими серверами. Он использует подход \\"agentless\\", что значит, что для своей работы не требует установки дополнительных агентов на управляемые машины. Вместо этого он полагается на существующее программное обеспечение (например, SSH для Linux/Unix систем и WinRM для Windows) для выполнения команд и скриптов на удаленных серверах. **Terraform**, разработанный HashiCorp, — это инструмент для **создания, изменения и версионирования инфраструктуры** как кода. Terraform используется для управления жизненным циклом инфраструктуры в целом, от развертывания новых серверов и сервисов до их обновлений и удаления, включая облака, виртуальные машины, сетевые устройства и многое другое, используя апи провайдеров ресурсов. # Подход и Методология **Ansible** применяет императивный подход: вы описываете последовательность задач, которые необходимо выполнить для достижения желаемого состояния системы. **Terraform** использует декларативный подход. Вы описываете желаемое состояние инфраструктуры, а Terraform вычисляет, какие действия нужно предпринять для достижения этого состояния, и обеспечивает идемпотентность, то есть повторное выполнение кода не приведет к изменениям, если система уже находится в желаемом состоянии. # Менеджмент Состояний **Terraform** управляет и отслеживает состояние инфраструктуры, что позволяет выполнять последовательные изменения и отслеживать историю изменений. Для каждого проекта Terraform хранит файл состояния, который используется для отслеживания всех управляемых ресурсов. **Ansible** не управляет состоянием инфраструктуры в явной форме и не требует хранения состояний между запусками. # Целевая Аудитория и Применение **Terraform** чаще используется инженерами и архитекторами инфраструктуры для создания и управления инфраструктурой на большом масштабе. **Ansible**, с другой стороны, широко применяется системными администраторами и DevOps-инженерами для автоматизации задач по установке и настройке программного обеспечения на уже существующей инфраструктуре. # Итог Выбор между Ansible и Terraform зависит от поставленных задач. Иногда их используют вместе, где Terraform служит для развертывания и масштабирования инфраструктуры \\"с нуля\\", а Ansible — для последующей настройки и управления конфигурациями узлов. Важно понимать, что оба инструмента могут дополнять друг друга, а не конкурировать."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This depth of contemplation adds a layer of realism and complexity to the narrative, making it more relatable and engaging for the audience. Love, being a central theme in many forms of literature and entertainment, resonates with most people, and exploring the complexities of relationships can provide valuable insights into human nature and emotional intelligence. When a protagonist thoughtfully weighs their options, it demonstrates a mindful approach to decision-making, reflecting the multifaceted nature of real-life relationships. This aspect invites the audience to empathize with the protagonist's dilemma, understanding that choosing a partner involves more than just romantic feelings. It encompasses considering emotional compatibility, shared values, life goals, and the potential impact of their choice on their own well-being and happiness, as well as on the lives of the people involved. Moreover, a carefully considered decision-making process in a love triangle scenario can address themes like personal growth, responsibility, and the importance of communication and honesty in relationships. It can also explore the consequences of choices, not just for the protagonist but for all individuals involved, making the narrative more layered and thought-provoking. In summary, a love triangle that is approached with depth, considering the real implications and consequences of the protagonist's choice, can indeed be taken seriously. It offers an opportunity for storytelling that resonates on a deeper emotional level, engaging the audience in a meaningful exploration of relationships and the human condition."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Dominating the scene is an old, weathered desk, cluttered with maps that seem to span the globe, and trinkets that hint at past exploits. Right at the center, catching the eye with its peculiar contrast to the surrounding chaos, lies a remarkably preserved letter. It's sealed with a deep red wax, embossed with a symbol that seems both ancient and ominously inviting. Surrounding this central artifact are hints of the room's owner: a magnifying glass, a faded photograph of a younger Lenny beside what looks like Egyptian ruins, and a half-empty cup of tea, long cold. *Summary:* It's a languid afternoon, and Logic Lenny, a young but renowned puzzle enthusiast and amateur archaeologist, finds himself sorting through his recent mail. Among the utility bills and magazines, a peculiar letter catches his eye. The seal, the weight of the paper, the faint smell of aged parchment—it all speaks of a mystery awaiting. As he carefully breaks the seal and unfolds the letter, he discovers an invitation that could only be described as destiny's call. The letter is from an unknown benefactor, inviting him to undertake an expedition to uncover a labyrinth rumored to contain the wisdom of ancient civilizations. The letter is vague on details but clear on the promise of adventure and discovery. It hints at puzzles and trials that only a mind like Lenny's could overcome. With every word, Lenny's pulse quickens. There's no question about it; he will accept the challenge. **Scene 2: Preparation and Departure** *Image Prompt:* The scene transitions to Lenny's bedroom, where the soft glow of dawn creeps through partially drawn curtains. In contrast to the organized chaos of his study, here, everything speaks of methodical preparation. An open suitcase lies on the bed, its contents meticulously arranged: a compass, a rugged flashlight, notebooks filled with scribbles and diagrams, old maps with routes traced in faded ink, and a peculiar, antique-looking key—its relevance unknown but its importance palpable. The room around the suitcase is a snapshot of Lenny's life: shelves filled with books on cryptography, archaeology, and adventure novels; framed certificates of his achievements; and a family portrait depicting Lenny with a woman and two younger siblings, their faces a mixture of pride and concern. *Summary:* The decision made, Lenny now faces the monumental task of preparing for an adventure into the unknown. With only the cryptic clues from the letter to guide him, he selects his tools and resources with care. Each item packed carries a purpose, a memory of past challenges overcome, or a hope for what knowledge the future might hold. As morning breaks, Lenny shares his plans with his family. While his mother frets over the dangers and his younger siblings buzz with excitement and a touch of envy, Lenny explains the importance of this journey, not just for the thrill but for the chance to discover truths long buried. Resolute despite the emotional turmoil, Lenny bids farewell to his family, stepping out into the dawn's early light with his suitcase in hand. A taxi awaits to take him to the airport, the first leg of his journey into the heart of an adventure that will test every ounce of his cunning, logic, and courage. This departure is not just a physical one; it marks Lenny's crossing from the known into the realm of possibilities, challenges, and the tantalizing promise of uncovering secrets that could rewrite history."},{"prompt":"describe chapter 2","completion":"# Chapter 2: The Entrance Found **Scene 1: The Hidden Door** *Image Prompt:* A dense, vibrant jungle teeming with life envelopes the scene. Sunlight filters through the thick canopy above, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. The air is thick with the sounds of distant animal calls and the close buzz of insects. At first glance, it's a seamless tapestry of green. But as the eye adjusts to the multitude of shades, a peculiar anomaly stands out—a stone structure, cleverly concealed by the surrounding vegetation, barely distinguishable from the natural landscape. An intricate door made of stone, covered in moss and vines, bears cryptic symbols that whisper of ancient secrets. It feels both inviting and foreboding, a gateway to wonders or perils untold. *Summary:* After days of navigating through dense jungles, following the cryptic clues laid out in the mysterious letter, Lenny and his hired local guide, Diego, come upon what they've been searching for—the hidden entrance to the labyrinth. Their journey to this point hasn’t been easy, facing both the challenges of the terrain and the skepticism of Diego, who's heard unnerving legends about the labyrinth. They stand before the door, silent in awe and contemplation. Lenny's heart races as he deciphers the symbols etched into the door, realizing they form a puzzle that could reveal the mechanism to unlock this ancient barrier. **Scene 2: The First Puzzle** *Image Prompt:* The scene narrows to concentrate on the door itself. Closer now, the complexity of its design becomes apparent. The stone surface is an intricate mesh of symbols, levers, and slidable panels, each element begging to be understood and manipulated. The surrounding flora seems to lean in, as if watching the intruders' attempts to unfold the door's secrets. The focus is on Lenny’s hands as they trace the symbols, his brow furrowed in concentration, a notebook in one hand filled with hastily scribbled notes and drawings. Diego looks on, skeptical but curious, as Lenny steps back, takes a deep breath, and, with a flash of insight, begins to engage with the puzzle with a newfound determination. *Summary:* The puzzle before Lenny is unlike anything he's encountered in books or his past adventures. It demands not just an understanding of the symbols, which turn out to be an ancient language lost to time, but a keen sense of logic and spatial awareness. As Lenny interacts with the puzzle, he narrates his thought process to Diego, who, despite his initial doubt, finds himself drawn into the challenge. They experiment with various combinations, facing setbacks but learning with each attempt. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, Lenny aligns the symbols in a sequence that triggers a slow, grinding sound. With bated breath, they watch as the stone door slides open, revealing the dark passage beyond. The triumph of solving the puzzle bonds Lenny and Diego closer, the shared success cementing their partnership as they stand at the threshold of the unknown. With flashlights in hand and a mix of excitement and apprehension, they step into the labyrinth, the door silently closing behind them, leaving the jungle whispers as a distant echo."},{"prompt":"3","completion":"# Chapter 3: Into the Labyrinth **Scene 1: The Hall of Mirrors** *Image Prompt:* Within the labyrinth, the passage opens into an expansive hall, an immediate assault on the senses. The walls, floor, and ceiling are made of mirrors, reflecting not only Lenny and Diego but also each other into infinity. The effect is disorienting, creating a space where up seems like down, left mirrors right, and the end looks infinitely far yet eerily close. The light from their flashlights dances across surfaces, fracturing into beams that carve the air into a kaleidoscope of light and shadow. In the center, a pedestal stands with a riddle inscribed, the key to navigating through this mirrored maze without losing oneself to madness. *Summary:* Lenny and Diego step cautiously into the Hall of Mirrors, immediately overwhelmed by the endless reflections. The riddle on the pedestal hints at a path that \\"reflects not where you’ve been, but where you need to go,\\" a puzzle that challenges Lenny's logical abilities to their limits. It's not just a matter of finding the way through; the hall's design messes with their sense of direction and reality. They experiment with different approaches, following the riddle's cryptic guidance, sometimes walking straight, sometimes doubling back. Progress is a process of trial and error, each step forward mirrored by a dozen misleading paths. Eventually, Lenny discerns a pattern in the chaos—a subtle difference in the reflections that guides them through the labyrinth of mirrors. Emerging on the other side, they find themselves stronger for the ordeal, their partnership deepened by the shared struggle. **Scene 2: The Room of Echoes** *Image Prompt:* After the visual chaos of the Hall of Mirrors, the next challenge is auditory. Lenny and Diego enter a circular room, its walls curved in such a way that sound is not absorbed but amplified and echoed back, creating a cacophony of sounds from their every move and word. The room is surprisingly bare, save for a series of instruments mounted on the walls—a horn, a drum, a set of chimes, and more, each likely a piece of the puzzle they need to solve. In the midst of this auditory maze stands a solitary pillar, with instructions that hint at \\"harmony in discord and melody in silence.\\" *Summary:* Initially, the overwhelming echoes in the Room of Echoes make communication between Lenny and Diego nearly impossible. The amplified sounds of their footsteps and the echoes of their voices create a bewildering din. The key to this challenge lies in understanding the sequence of using the instruments—a task that requires both to listen beyond the noise and find the pattern that silences the cacophony. Lenny, with his knack for patterns, and Diego, who reveals a surprising musical talent, begin to experiment with the instruments. Through a process of elimination and careful listening, they discover that each instrument contributes a specific tone to a harmonious sequence that, when played correctly, quiets the room's echoes. This harmony unlocks a hidden door in the floor, opening silently to reveal a staircase leading deeper into the labyrinth. The Room of Echoes teaches them the value of listening and working in unison, a lesson they'll carry forward as the labyrinth continues to test their resolve and teamwork."},{"prompt":"4","completion":"# Chapter 4: Loop-de-Loop Safari **Scene 1: The Serpentine Path** *Image Prompt:* Lenny and Diego find themselves on a bewildering path that appears to defy the laws of physics. The path is narrow and winding, surrounded by walls that subtly shift in color and pattern, suggesting movement and change. The path itself loops and twists in impossible ways, creating loops, steep drops, and sudden rises as if the very ground decided to mimic a roller coaster. The air around them seems to shimmer, hinting at hidden forces at work. The path ahead appears endless, and behind, it seems to reconfigure itself, preventing any retreat. Small, luminescent plants dot the edges of the path, their light a guide and perhaps a subtle cue to the path's secrets. *Summary:* In the Loop-de-Loop Safari, Lenny and Diego face a puzzle that tests their endurance and their willingness to embrace the illogical. As they traverse the serpentine path, they notice that their progression seems paradoxically both forward and backward. Lenny deduces that the key to navigating this path lies in understanding its nature—it's not meant to be fought against but understood and flowed with. They start noticing patterns in the luminescent plants, which seem to pulse in a sequence indicating when and where the path will loop or twist next. By predicting these changes and moving in harmony with the path’s rhythm, they manage to navigate through the Safari, each loop bringing them closer to the exit, a lesson in trust and adaptation under the most bewildering conditions. **Scene 2: The Menagerie of Paradoxes** *Image Prompt:* Beyond the Safari, Lenny and Diego enter a vast, open garden under a sky that shifts colors unnervingly. This garden, or menagerie, is filled with creatures of impossibility and paradox. There's a rabbit that disappears and reappears a few steps away every time they try to approach it, a bird that sings in silence, its song only visible as ripples in the air, and a cat that seems simultaneously asleep and awake, its eyes closed yet meeting their gazes. Each creature embodies a different logical paradox, challenging the visitors' perceptions and understandings of reality. *Summary:* The Menagerie of Paradoxes represents the labyrinth's heart, where logic meets magic, and the rules of the outside world no longer apply. The challenge here is not to solve but to understand and accept the impossibility. Lenny, with his deeply logical mind, initially struggles with the inherent contradictions presented by the menagerie. Diego, more open to the mystical and unexplainable, helps guide them through this space by encouraging Lenny to see beyond binary truths and absolutes. They interact with each paradoxical creature, learning from them lessons in accepting the unexplained and finding balance in contradiction. This revelation allows them to navigate through the menagerie, reaching its core where they find a glowing orb. This orb, the embodiment of harmony within paradox, opens the final gate leading them towards the labyrinth’s heart. The Menagerie of Paradoxes teaches them the value of questioning their perceptions and embracing the mysteries that defy explanation, preparing them for the ultimate truths awaiting in the labyrinth's depths."},{"prompt":"5","completion":"# Chapter 5: The Heart of the Labyrinth **Scene 1: The Library of Lost Wisdom** *Image Prompt:* As Lenny and Diego proceed beyond the final gate, they are engulfed by a serene silence, a stark contrast to the chaotic challenges they've faced. Before them stands an awe-inspiring sight: an enormous, ancient library, its architecture a harmonious blend of various civilizations, from towering Greek columns to intricate Egyptian hieroglyphs adorning the walls. The library is filled with scrolls, books, and tablets, some seemingly hovering in mid-air, held by unseen forces. Rays of sunlight filter through stained glass windows, painting the room in vibrant hues, illuminating dust motes that dance like tiny stars in the expansive space. The silence is profound, suggesting that this place is sacred, a repository of knowledge untouched by time. *Summary:* Overwhelmed by the vastness and the beauty of the Library of Lost Wisdom, Lenny and Diego step inside with reverence. They quickly understand that this library contains not just books and scrolls but the accumulated knowledge of civilizations both known and unknown. The air is thick with an inexplicable energy, as if the library itself is alive, aware of its visitors. As they explore, they find that the library offers knowledge freely but demands respect and understanding. Each book or scroll they attempt to read presents itself in a language or symbolism initially incomprehensible, which becomes clear only when approached with genuine desire and humility. Lenny realizes that this place is the labyrinth's heart, its very reason for existing—not a treasure of gold or jewels, but of wisdom and learning. By sharing its knowledge, the library bestows upon them insights into not just history and science but the deeper truths of existence and consciousness. **Scene 2: The Keeper of the Labyrinth** *Image Prompt:* Deep within the library, amidst the quiet rustle of turning pages and the soft glow of knowledge held within endless texts, an enigmatic figure emerges from the shadows. This is the Keeper of the Labyrinth, an ageless being whose eyes hold the depth of centuries. Their appearance is an amalgamation of various cultures, with robes flowing in ethereal patterns and a gentle smile that speaks of profound wisdom and a touch of melancholy. The Keeper seems neither surprised nor concerned by Lenny and Diego's presence, welcoming them as if they were long-expected guests. The air around them shimmers slightly, suggesting that the Keeper is not entirely bound by the physical laws that govern the rest of the labyrinth. *Summary:* The Keeper welcomes Lenny and Diego, congratulating them on reaching the heart of the labyrinth. They explain that the labyrinth is not just a physical structure but a living testament to the universe's complexity and beauty. It is a guardian of knowledge, designed to challenge and enlighten those who dare to explore its depths. The Keeper reveals that many have attempted to navigate the labyrinth, but few have reached its heart with the humility and understanding that Lenny and Diego have shown. They offer insights into the questions that Lenny and Diego have gathered on their journey—answers that are profound yet open-ended, encouraging further reflection and exploration. The Keeper imparts to them a final piece of wisdom: the journey through the labyrinth is a metaphor for life's journey, filled with challenges, mysteries, and opportunities for growth and understanding. As they prepare to leave, the Keeper fades into the library's shadows, leaving behind a sense of peace and a deeper connection to the universe's wonders. Lenny and Diego emerge from the library transformed, carrying with them not just the knowledge they've gained but a newfound appreciation for the journey's importance itself."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],W={key:0},F={key:1};function R(n,e,l,p,o,r){const u=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(v,null,b(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
