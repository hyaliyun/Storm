Which starting number must Bob choose to prevent Alice from winning? (Richard Henner)","completion":"Let s be the starting number, a be Alice's game number, and b be Bob's game number. The first step is to analyze the condition under which Bob could win. We introduce the concept of a game round, in which Alice and Bob each get one turn to add their respective numbers to the current total. To formalize the problem: 1. Define one game round as the addition of a (Alice's number) followed by the addition of b (Bob's number). Hence, in one game round, the total increase to the number will be a + b = 19 + 20 = 39. 2. Let n be the number of game rounds required. For Bob to win: - Bob wins if the total reaches exactly 2019 on his turn. Thus, we need to solve: [ s + 39n = 2019 ] However, since s can be either 9 or 10, let’s check these cases. Case for s = 9: [ 9 + 39n = 2019 ] Solving for n, we get: [ 39n = 2010 ] [ n = frac{2010}{39} approx 51.538 ] Since n is required to be an integer, and 2010 is not divisible perfectly by 39, Bob cannot win in this case. Case for s = 10: [ 10 + 39n = 2019 ] Solving for n, we get: [ 39n = 2009 ] [ n = frac{2009}{39} approx 51.513 ] Similarly, since 2009 is not divisible perfectly by 39, Bob cannot win in this case either. Thus, we conclude that: [ text{Bob cannot win.} ] Next, we determine which starting number Bob should choose to prevent Alice from winning. For Alice to win, she must be able to add her number to make the total exactly 2019. The equation for Alice's win condition becomes: [ s + 39n + a = 2019 ] Rewriting, we get: [ s + a = 2019 - 39n ] To find suitable values: - Given 28 leq a + s leq 30 (since Alice's number a is 19 or 20 and s is 9 or 10), - a + s = 30 for multiple rounds to ensure completing exactly at 2019. Therefore, if: [ s = 10, a = 20 ] In such a case: [ 10 + 39 cdot 51 + 20 = 2019 ] Hence, Alice wins. To prevent this, Bob should choose any start value where s + a neq 30. Therefore, if Bob selects s = 9, Alice cannot win since s + a neq 30 with Alice’s game number being 20 or 19. # Conclusion: To prevent Alice from winning, Bob must choose the starting number 9.

Suppose the polygon is arbitrarily complex like a generalized simple polygon (not necessarily convex). - Assume any line passing through (O ) intersects the polygon in exactly three points. 4. **Example Visualization**: - Let's say at specific instances, a line intersects at points (A, B, C, A', B', C') such that: - A, O, A^{prime} are collinear, - B, O, B^{prime} are collinear, - C, O, C^{prime} are collinear. 5. **Interpretation and Analysis**: - The key constraint is that every line through (O) intersects the boundary of the polygon at exactly three pairs of points. - This means that the configuration ensures the polygon is always split into exactly three distinct smaller polygons. 6. **Conclusion**: - Hence, the polygon we are dealing with can accommodate this unique intersection property.

Analyzing the monotonicity of the function b(a), we see that it is increasing on (0, frac {1}{e}) and decreasing on ( frac {1}{e},+infty). Consequently, b achieves its maximum value when a= frac {1}{e}, which gives us b= frac {1}{2e^{2}}. boxed{b= frac {1}{2e^{2}}} is the maximum value for b. To solve the problem, we start by equating the derivatives of both functions at the common point to find the x-coordinate. With the x-coordinate known, we proceed by equating the functions themselves to isolate and express b in terms of a. Finally, by considering the monotonicity of the newly formed function b(a) and finding the derivative, we determine the critical points which lead us to the maximum value of b. This problem tests the application of derivatives, equation of tangent lines, and the techniques used in finding monotonicity and maximum values of functions, challenging the computational abilities of the students."},{"prompt":"Given points A(3,3,1), B(1,0,5), and C(0,1,0), find the distance from the midpoint M of segment AB to point C.","completion":"Let M(x, y, z) be the midpoint of segment AB. therefore x = frac{3+1}{2} = 2, y = frac{3}{2}, z = frac{1+5}{2} = 3, therefore Mleft(2, frac{3}{2}, 3right), Given C(0, 1, 0), therefore MC = sqrt{2^2 + left(frac{3}{2} - 1right)^2 + 3^2} = frac{sqrt{53}}{2}, Thus, the answer is: boxed{frac{sqrt{53}}{2}}.

To convert x^{2}+y^{2}+4x-2y+1=0 into this form, we complete the squares: - For x^2 + 4x, we add and subtract (4/2)^2 = 4. - For y^2 - 2y, we add and subtract (2/2)^2 = 1. Thus, the equation becomes x^{2}+4x+4 + y^{2}-2y+1 = 4+1-1, or (x+2)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 4. The center is (-2,1), and the radius is r = sqrt{4} = 2. 2. **Calculate the distance from the center of the circle to the line l.** The distance d from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. For the line frac{x}{4}-frac{y}{3}=0 or 3x-4y=0, and the center (-2,1), we have: [d = frac{|3(-2) - 4(1)|}{sqrt{3^2 + (-4)^2}} = frac{|-6 - 4|}{sqrt{9 + 16}} = frac{10}{sqrt{25}} = 2] 3. **Compare the distance to the radius of the circle.** Since the distance from the center of the circle to the line equals the radius of the circle (2), the line is tangent to the circle. Therefore, the position relationship between the circle C and the line l is tangent.

Compare the total distance when the school is placed at different vertices: - If the school is at (A): [ text{Total distance} = 100 cdot 0 + 200 cdot |AB| + 300 cdot |AC| ] - If the school is at (B): [ text{Total distance} = 100 cdot |AB| + 200 cdot 0 + 300 cdot |BC| ] - If the school is at (C): [ text{Total distance} = 100 cdot |AC| + 200 cdot |BC| + 300 cdot 0 ] 5. Now we need to analyze and compare these distances: - When the school is placed at any arbitrary point ( X ) other than ( C ), we can use the fact that moving the school from ( X ) to ( C ) reduces the distance. - The change in the total distance when moving the school from ( X ) to ( C ) is: [ Delta D = 300 |CX| - 100 (|AX| - |AC|) - 200 (|BX| - |BC|) ] 6. Since (|AX| - |AC|leq |CX| ) and (|BX| - |BC|leq |CX|), the total expression ( Delta D ) will be negative: [ Delta D = 300 |CX| - 100 (|AX| - |AC|) - 200 (|BX| - |BC|) < 300 |CX| - 100 |CX| - 200 |CX| = 0 ] Therefore, moving the school to (C) will indeed reduce the total distance. # Conclusion: The optimal location to build the school such that the total distance traveled by all students is minimized is village ( C ).

For ( i = 0, 1, 2, ldots ), let ( Q_i(x) = (1 + x)^i ). We need to prove that if ( i_1, i_2, ldots, i_n ) are integers satisfying ( 0 le i_1 < i_2 < ldots < i_n ), then: [ o(Q_{i_1} + Q_{i_2} + ldots + Q_{i_n}) ge o(Q_{i_1}). ] 2. **Binary representation and odd coefficients:** Let ( D(n) ) denote the positions in which ( n ) has digit ( 1 ) in base ( 2 ). For example, ( D(4) = {2} ) and ( D(5) = {2, 0} ). Notice that the coefficient of ( x^k ) in ( Q_n ) is odd if and only if ( D(k) subseteq D(n) ). 3. **Constructing the injection ( f ):** We will create an injection ( f ) from the ( k )'s that satisfy ( D(k) subseteq D(i_1) ) to the ( k )'s that satisfy ( D(k) subseteq D(i_j) ) for an odd number of ( j )'s. This will end the problem. 4. **Defining ( f(k) ):** First of all, ( f(k) ) will satisfy that ( D(f(k)) cap D(i_1) = D(k) ) (that is, ( f(k) ) will be ( k ) plus some other digits ( 1 ) that are not in ( i_1 )). This will guarantee injectivity, since if ( f(k_1) = f(k_2) ), then ( D(k_1) = D(f(k_1)) cap D(i_1) = D(f(k_2)) cap D(i_1) = D(k_2) ) so ( k_1 = k_2 ). 5. **Constructing ( f ) for even ( m ):** Let ( 1 < j_1, ldots, j_m ) be such that ( D(k) subseteq D(i_{j_t}) ) for all ( 1 le t le m ). If ( m ) is even, then ( D(f(k)) subseteq D(i_r) ) for an odd number of ( r )'s, so let ( f(k) = k ), which satisfies ( D(f(k)) cap D(i_1) = D(k) ) since ( D(k) subseteq D(i_1) ). 6. **Constructing ( f ) for odd ( m ):** If ( m ) is odd, let ( D ) be the set of positions in binary that are ( 0 ) in ( i_1 ), but that are ( 1 ) in ( i_r ) for some ( r ). For each ( 1 le t le m ), let ( X_t ) be the set of nonempty sets ( Y ) that satisfy ( Y subseteq D cap D(i_{j_t}) ). Notice that ( D cap D(i_{j_t}) ge 1 ) since ( i_{j_t} ) has digits ( 1 ) that are ( 0 ) in ( i_1 ). Since ( Y ) cannot be empty, we have that ( |X_t| ) must equal a power of ( 2 ) minus 1, and therefore ( X_t ) is odd for all ( 1 le t le m ). 7. **Summing ( |X_t| ):** Since ( m ) is odd, the sum of all ( |X_t| ) is odd. But the sum of all ( |X_t| ) equals ( sum_{Y subseteq D} g(Y) ), where ( g(Y) ) is the number of ( t )'s such that ( Y in X_t ). Therefore, there must exist a nonempty subset ( Y ) of ( D ) such that ( g(Y) ) is odd. We will have ( f(k) ) be such that ( D(f(k)) = D(k) cup Y ). Clearly ( D(f(k)) cap D(i_1) = D(k) ). 8. **Verifying ( f(k) ):** Now we must prove ( D(f(k)) subseteq D(i_r) ) for an odd number of ( r )'s. Notice that ( D(f(k)) subseteq D(i_r) ) is only possible if ( r = j_t ) for some ( t ), or ( r = 1 ). Since ( Y ) is a nonempty set of positions in binary which are ( 0 ) in ( i_1 ), we have that ( r = 1 ) does not work. Therefore, the number of ( r )'s for which ( D(f(k)) subseteq D(i_r) ) is equal to ( g(Y) ) (by definition), which is odd. Therefore, we have constructed ( f ) successfully! Huzzah!

The path is a straight diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner. 2. **Using the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The key to solving this problem is to use the fact that the number of tiles the bug crosses in each direction (width and length) is related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the width and the length of the rectangle. The GCD of 10 and 17 is 1 since they are relatively prime (no common divisors other than 1). 3. **Calculating the Number of Tiles Crossed**: When the GCD of the width and length is 1, the number of tiles crossed by the diagonal line can be calculated using the formula: [ text{Number of tiles crossed} = text{width} + text{length} - text{GCD(width, length)} ] Substituting the values, we get: [ text{Number of tiles crossed} = 10 + 17 - 1 = 26 ] 4. **Verification by Drawing**: Optionally, you can draw a diagram or use a scale model to visually count the tiles.

To count the number of 5s in 170!, we divide 170 by 5 and count all multiples of 5, then divide by 5^2 (25) to count all multiples of 25, and so on until the result is less than 1. 170 / 5 = 34 (there are 34 multiples of 5 between 1 and 170) 170 / 25 = 6 (there are 6 multiples of 25 between 1 and 170) 170 / 125 = 1 (there is 1 multiple of 125 between 1 and 170) We don't need to go any further since 170 / 625 < 1. Now, we add up the counts: 34 (from 5) + 6 (from 25) + 1 (from 125) = 41 So, the largest value of n for which 170! / 10^n is an integer is 41, because there are 41 factors of 5 in 170!, and thus at least 41 factors of 10.

We already have (2^3) and (3^1) in 936, but we need at least (2^5) and (3^3). So we need to multiply by at least (2^2) to get (2^5) and by (3^2) to get (3^3).

Mathematically, this can be expressed as: [ P_i = A_i + P_1 ] where ( A_i + P_1 ) denotes the translation of ( P_1 ) by the vector ( A_i ). 3. **Bounding the Translated Polyhedra:** Since ( P_1 ) is convex, the translated polyhedra ( P_i ) will lie within a larger polyhedron formed by scaling ( P_1 ) by a factor of 2. This is because any point in ( P_i ) can be written as ( A_i + x ) where ( x in P_1 ). Therefore, the set of all such points lies within: [ 2P_1 = { x + y mid x, y in P_1 } ] This follows from the property of convex sets that the Minkowski sum of two convex sets is also convex and lies within the scaled version of the original set. 4. **Volume Consideration:** Let ( V ) be the volume of the original polyhedron ( P_1 ). The volume of ( 2P_1 ), which is the polyhedron ( P_1 ) scaled by a factor of 2, is ( 8V ) because scaling a three-dimensional object by a factor of 2 increases its volume by ( 2^3 = 8 ). 5. **Volume Argument for Overlap:** We have 9 polyhedra ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_9 ), each with volume ( V ). The total volume of these 9 polyhedra is: [ 9V ] Since all these polyhedra lie within ( 2P_1 ), which has a volume of ( 8V ), it is impossible for all 9 polyhedra to fit within ( 2P_1 ) without overlapping.

However, we are also given that A is a factor of 4701. We need to check if 1624 is indeed a factor of 4701. To check if 1624 is a factor of 4701, we divide 4701 by 1624: 4701 ÷ 1624 = 2.893 (approximately) Since the division does not result in a whole number, 1624 is not a factor of 4701. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the given values because A cannot be 1624 and also be a factor of 4701. Let's re-evaluate the given conditions to see if there's a possible mistake. The remainder (D) when dividing by B (the divisor) must be less than B. In this case, D is given as 31, which is less than B (59), so that part is correct. However, if A is a factor of 4701, then the quotient (C) and remainder (D) must be such that when we multiply C by B and add D, the result should be a factor of 4701. Since 1624 is not a factor of 4701, we need to find a value of A that is both a multiple of B (59) and a factor of 4701. To find such a value, we can list the factors of 4701 and see which ones are multiples of 59. The factors of 4701 are: 1, 59, 79, and 4701. Among these factors, 59 and 4701 are multiples of 59. Since we already have B = 59, let's consider the largest factor, 4701, as a potential value for A. If A = 4701, we can find the quotient (C) by dividing A by B: 4701 ÷ 59 = 79 with a remainder of 0. This means that if A is 4701, then C would be 79, not 27 as given, and D would be 0, not 31.

We assume without loss of generality that the angles are ordered as follows: angle A geq angle B geq angle C.

In this scenario, we have angle A - angle B leq angle B - angle C. Therefore, we can write: [ cos left( frac{1}{2}(angle A - angle B) right) geq cos left( frac{1}{2}(angle B - angle C) right) ] Hence, this implies: [ frac{h_{c}}{l_{c}} geq frac{h_{a}}{l_{a}} ] Similarly, we deduce: [ frac{h_{c}}{l_{c}} geq frac{h_{b}}{l_{b}} ] Given the initial inequalities h_{c} < h_{a} + h_{b}, we conclude: [ l_{c} < l_{a} + l_{b} ] 4. **Case 2: angle B leq 60^circ:** In the case where angle B leq 60^circ, we observe angle C > 30^circ (since angle A < 90^circ). For this situation, we can establish: [ l_{a} geq h_{a} = AC sin angle C > frac{AC}{2} ] and [ l_{b} geq frac{BC}{2} ] Also, it is important to note that the bisector l_{c} does not exceed the corresponding median, which equals less than the semi-sum of the sides AC and BC. 5. **General Conclusion:** Given these inequalities, we observe the similar triangulation property that: - For angle B geq 60^circ, l_c < l_a + l_b is validated based on the altitude comparison. - For angle B leq 60^circ, it follows from corresponding sides comparison ensuring l_c < l_a + l_b.

To find the value of one unit, we divide y's share by 1.25: 1 unit = Rs. 48.50 / 1.25 1 unit = Rs. 38.80 Now we can find the total amount by adding the shares of w, x, y, and z in units and then converting to rupees: Total units = w's share (2 units) + x's share (0.75 units) + y's share (1.25 units) + z's share (0.85 units) Total units = 2 + 0.75 + 1.25 + 0.85 Total units = 4.85 Now, convert the total units to rupees: Total amount = Total units * value of 1 unit Total amount = 4.85 units * Rs. 38.80/unit Total amount = Rs. 188.08 So, the total amount is Rs. boxed{188.08} ."},{"prompt":"1.

The zero vector sum condition implies that the vectors are balanced around the origin. 2. **Length of Sum of Vectors**: The length of the sum of any subset of vectors cannot exceed the number of vectors in that subset. This is because the maximum length is achieved when all vectors in the subset point in the same direction. 3. **Choosing Subsets**: - Assume we select (n) vectors from the initial 100. The maximum possible magnitude of their sum is (n), given that they all point in approximately the same direction. - If (n leq 59), the maximum length of the sum of these vectors is 59, which is insufficient for our requirement of the length being at least 60. 4. **Considering Larger Subsets**: - Suppose we select at least 60 vectors (i.e., (n geq 60)). Then the remaining vectors will be (100 - n), which means (40) or fewer vectors will remain. - The sum of the remaining vectors must also be considered. Since the total sum of all 100 vectors is zero, the sum of the remaining vectors will be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the sum of the selected vectors. Hence, the length of the sum of the remaining vectors would be at most (100 - n). 5. **Contradiction**: - If (n geq 60), then (100 - n leq 40). - For the sum of the remaining vectors to balance out the vector sum to zero while having more than (60) vectors summing to 60 in magnitude would force some contradictions: - The magnitude of vector sums should match exactly. - It's impossible as the leftover vectors, being less than 60, can't form a balance in magnitude greater than their count.

Since the park welcomed 100 people per day, the total for these five days would be: 100 people/day * 5 days = 500 people On Saturday, 200 people visited the park. So, the total number of people who visited the park from Monday to Saturday is: 500 people (Monday to Friday) + 200 people (Saturday) = 700 people Now, let's calculate the total revenue from these 700 people. Since each ticket costs 3, the revenue from these 700 people would be: 700 people * 3/ticket = 2100 The park made 3000 overall in a week, so the revenue from Sunday's visitors would be the difference between the total weekly revenue and the revenue from Monday to Saturday: 3000 (total weekly revenue) - 2100 (revenue from Monday to Saturday) = 900 Now, let's find out how many people visited the park on Sunday.

The train has 24 carriages, each 60 meters long, so the total length of the carriages is: 24 carriages * 60 meters/carriage = 1440 meters The engine is also 60 meters long, so the total length of the train including the engine is: 1440 meters (carriages) + 60 meters (engine) = 1500 meters Now, we need to add the length of the bridge to the total length of the train to find out the distance the train needs to cover to completely cross the bridge. The bridge is 1.5 km long, which is equivalent to: 1.5 km * 1000 meters/km = 1500 meters So, the total distance to be covered by the train to cross the bridge is: 1500 meters (train) + 1500 meters (bridge) = 3000 meters The speed of the train is given as 60 kmph. To calculate the time, we need to convert this speed into meters per second (m/s) because our distance is in meters. 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, 60 kmph is equivalent to: 60 kmph * (1000 meters/km) / (3600 seconds/hour) = 16.67 meters/second Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 3000 meters / 16.67 meters/second ≈ 179.88 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{179.88} seconds for the train to cross the bridge."},{"prompt":"f x is a real number and |x5| + |x7| < b, where b > 0, determine the correct range for b such that the inequality holds for some real number x.

Consider the following steps to prove this: - If a square can be divided into n smaller squares, one of these squares can be further divided into 4 smaller squares. - By dividing one of the n squares into 4 smaller sections, we effectively add 3 more squares to the original n. - Therefore, a square that can be divided into n squares can also be divided into n + 3 squares (since n + 3 = n + 1 + 3 = 4 new squares total). This observation verifies the hereditary nature of mathcal{P}(n). The figure on the left in the source depicts this process. 3. **Initial Cases**: Since mathcal{P}(n+3) holds if mathcal{P}(n) holds, we need to start with the initial values for n > 5. Therefore, we need to prove mathcal{P}(6), mathcal{P}(7), and mathcal{P}(8). - For n = 6: We can divide the square as follows: - Divide one square into 4 smaller squares. - Divide one of the remaining sections further into 3 smaller squares. - For n = 7: We can implement a similar approach: - Divide one square into 4 smaller squares. - Divide another section into 3 smaller squares. - For n = 8: Again, implement a similar strategy: - Initially divide one square into 4 smaller squares. - Divide two of the remaining sections into 2 smaller squares each. The figure on the right in the source explains these specific divisions visually. By starting with these initial conditions, it becomes apparent that mathcal{P}(6), mathcal{P}(7), and mathcal{P}(8) hold. 4. **Conclusion**: Since we have shown that for n = 6, 7, 8, the property mathcal{P}(n) holds, and we have also proven that if mathcal{P}(n) holds, then mathcal{P}(n+3) holds, it follows that for all n > 5, mathcal{P}(n) is true.

The new total amount of liquid X in the solution is the sum of the liquid X from the remaining solution and the liquid X from the added solution: (P/100) * 8 + (P/100) * 2 = (P/100) * (8 + 2) = (P/100) * 10 The new total weight of the solution is the remaining 6 kilograms plus the added 2 kilograms, which equals 8 kilograms. According to the problem, after these changes, the new solution is 25% liquid X. This means that the amount of liquid X in the new solution is 25% of the total weight of the new solution: 25% of 8 kilograms = 0.25 * 8 = 2 kilograms So, we have the equation: (P/100) * 10 = 2 Now we can solve for P: P * 10 = 2 * 100 P * 10 = 200 P = 200 / 10 P = 20 Therefore, the initial percentage of liquid X in the solution was boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"A list of five positive integers has a median of 4 and a mean of 11.

This step is implicit in the analysis since we directly jump to using the sum of the numerators equals or greater than 9, leveraging the common denominator (a-c) which is the sum of (a-b) and (b-c). **Step 3: Apply the AM-GM inequality** We recognize that the structure 1+m+2sqrt{m} can be derived from the AM-GM inequality, where the arithmetic mean of two numbers is greater than or equal to their geometric mean.

This means every rectangle consisting of ( n ) cells contains an odd number of red cells. - Consider a rectangle consisting of ( pn ) cells. Since ( p ) is an odd prime, the rectangle must have a dimension (length or width) divisible by ( p ) and can thus be subdivided into ( p ) rectangles, each consisting of ( n ) cells. - Each of these ( p ) rectangles contains an odd number of red cells. Since the sum of ( p ) odd numbers is odd, the entire ( pn )-cell rectangle contains an odd number of red cells. - Therefore, if ( n ) is good, ( pn ) is also good. 4. **Proof of (ii)**: - We need to show that for ( n = 2^k ), there exists a coloring such that every rectangle with ( 2^k ) cells contains an odd number of red cells. - Rectangles with ( n = 2^k ) cells have ( k+1 ) possible shapes: ( 2^m times 2^{k-m} ) for ( 0 leq m leq k ). - **Claim**: For each of these ( k+1 ) shapes, there exists a coloring with two properties: - Every rectangle with ( n ) cells and shape ( 2^m times 2^{k-m} ) contains an odd number of red cells. - Every rectangle with ( n ) cells and a different shape contains an even number of red cells. 5. **Constructing the Coloring**: - Assume the cells are labeled with ( (x, y) in mathbb{Z}^2 ). Color a cell red if ( x equiv 0 pmod{2^m} ) and ( y equiv 0 pmod{2^{k-m}} ). - For example, a ( 4 times 2 ) rectangle gets the following coloring: - A ( 2^m times 2^{k-m} ) rectangle contains every possible pair ( (x mod 2^m, y mod 2^{k-m}) ) exactly once, so such a rectangle will contain one red cell (an odd number). - Consider a ( 2^{ell} times 2^{k-ell} ) rectangle with ( ell > m ). The set of cells this covers is ( (x, y) ) where ( x ) covers a range of size ( 2^{ell} ) and ( y ) covers a range of size ( 2^{k-ell} ). The number of red cells is the count of ( x ) with ( x equiv 0 mod 2^m ) multiplied by the count of ( y ) with ( y equiv 0 mod 2^{k-m} ). The former number is exactly ( 2^{ell-m} ) because ( 2^m ) divides ( 2^{ell} ) (while the latter is ( 0 ) or ( 1 )), so the number of red cells is even. The ( ell < m ) case is similar. 6. **Combining Colorings**: - Given these ( k+1 ) colorings, we can add them up modulo 2, i.e., a cell will be colored red if it is red in an odd number of these ( k+1 ) colorings. - This ensures that every ( 2^m times 2^{k-m} ) rectangle contains an odd number of red cells, and every other shape contains an even number of red cells. 7. **Conclusion**: - By proving (i) and (ii), we have shown that all positive integers ( n ) are good.

We assume (omega_{a} > 1) and (omega_{b} > 1) for the remainder of the proof. 2. **Prime Factorization Argumentation**: Let (p) be a prime factor of (omega_{a}). Since (omega_{a}) and (omega_{b}) are coprime, (p) does not divide (omega_{b}). Therefore, (omega_{a} cdot omega_{b}/p) is not an integer because (p) is a factor of (omega_{a}) but not of (omega_{b}). 3. **Simplified Intermediate Steps**: Consider [ (ab)^{frac{omega_{a}omega_{b}}{p}} equiv a^{frac{omega_{a}omega_{b}}{p}} cdot b^{frac{omega_{a}omega_{b}}{p}} pmod{n} ] Notice that [ a^{frac{omega_{a}omega_{b}}{p}} notequiv 1 pmod{n} ] because (frac{omega_{a}omega_{b}}{p}) does not contain all the factors of (omega_{a}). 4. **Implication by Order Property**: Thus, (omega_{ab}) does not divide (frac{omega_{a}omega_{b}}{p}). Similarly, if (q) is a prime factor of (omega_{b}), (omega_{ab}) does not divide (frac{omega_{a}omega_{b}}{q}). 5. **Modulo Results to Constrain Order**: Since modulo properties hold, [ (ab)^{omega_{a}omega_{b}} equiv left(a^{omega_{a}}right)^{omega_{b}} left(b^{omega_{b}}right)^{omega_{a}} equiv 1 pmod{n} ] showing that (omega_{ab}) must divide (omega_{a}omega_{b}). 6. **Combining Results**: From step 4 and step 5, the only possible order for (ab) that divides (omega_{a}omega_{b}) and satisfies all the properties discussed is (omega_{a}omega_{b}) itself. # Conclusion: [ boxed{omega_{ab} = omega_{a} cdot omega_{b}} ]"},{"prompt":"w many values of x, 10 < x < 50, satisfy cos^2 x + 3sin^2 x = 1?

Since both spheres are touching the plane (Pi), the distance from (O_1) and (O_2) to (Pi) is (r). Hence, (O_1 O_2 parallel Pi), meaning the distance from (H) to (Pi) is also (r). Define: - (varphi = angle HAO_3) - (psi) as the angle between the line segment (AH) and the plane (Pi). We note that segments (AH) and (O_3H) are perpendicular to (O_1H) because they are medians in the isosceles triangles (O_1O_2A) and (O_1O_2O_3). Therefore, the segment (O_1H) is perpendicular to the plane (HAO_3), and hence to the line (AO_3). Consequently, the projections of segments (AH) and (AO_1) on the line (AO_3) are equal. Thus, [ AH cdot cos varphi = AO_1 cdot cos(alpha + beta) = frac{AH}{cosalpha} cdot cos(alpha + beta) ] Since ( sin psi = frac{r}{AH} = operatorname{tg} alpha ), let's consider the two cases: **Case 1:** (varphi = pi - beta - psi) From the left diagram, we have: [ cos(pi - beta - psi) = frac{cos(alpha + beta)}{cos alpha} ] This simplifies to: [ sin beta sin psi - cos beta cos psi = cos beta - sin beta operatorname{tg} alpha ] Further simplifying, we get: [ cos beta (1 + cos psi) = 2 sin beta sin psi Longrightarrow operatorname{tg} frac{psi}{2} = frac{1}{2} operatorname{ctg} beta = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, [ operatorname{tg} alpha = sin psi = frac{2 operatorname{tg} frac{psi}{2}}{1 + operatorname{tg}^2 frac{psi}{2}} = frac{4}{5} ] **Case 2:** (varphi = psi - beta) From the right diagram, we have: [ cos(psi - beta) = frac{cos(alpha + beta)}{cos alpha} ] This simplifies to: [ cos beta cos psi + sin beta sin psi = cos beta - sin beta operatorname{tg} alpha ] Further simplifying, we get: [ cos beta (1 - cos psi) = 2 sin beta sin psi Longrightarrow operatorname{ctg} frac{psi}{2} = frac{1}{2} operatorname{ctg} beta = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, [ operatorname{tg} alpha = sin psi = frac{2 operatorname{ctg} frac{psi}{2}}{1 + operatorname{ctg}^2 frac{psi}{2}} = frac{4}{5} ] In both cases, we get the same result.

We know that the molecular weight of the compound is 84. The atomic weight of aluminum is approximately 26.98, and the atomic weight of fluorine (which forms fluoride ions) is approximately 19.00. Since there are three fluoride atoms in the compound, we can calculate their total contribution to the molecular weight as follows: 3 fluoride atoms * 19.00 (atomic weight of fluorine) = 57.00 Now, we subtract the total weight of the fluoride from the molecular weight of the compound to find the weight of the aluminum atom: 84 (molecular weight of the compound) - 57.00 (total weight of fluoride) = 27.00 This is very close to the atomic weight of aluminum, which confirms that the element that combines with fluoride to form this compound is indeed aluminum (Al).

This is how the Small Island is arranged, where there are only 6 counties (see Fig. 1). Draw how the Big Island can be arranged if it has an odd number of counties. How many counties did you get?","completion":"We start by understanding that each island (both the Small Island and the Big Island) is divided into rectangular sections, referred to as \\"grafts,\\" with diagonal roads connecting opposing corners of these rectangles. The Small Island consists of 6 such grafts, where the roads form a continuous loop, and no point is visited more than once. Given that the Big Island has an odd number of grafts, we need to illustrate a case and ensure it obeys the closed-loop property while noting that no point is revisited. The reference figure shows an example for a Big Island with 9 grafts. We demonstrate through logical deduction why having an odd number of grafts less than 9 (e.g., 7) is not feasible. 1. **Categorizing Roads and Their Patterns:** - Roads can be categorized into two types based on which corners they connect: - **Type 1:** Connects the top-left corner with the bottom-right corner. - **Type 2:** Connects the bottom-left corner with the top-right corner. - In any closed path, roads of both types must alternate. If they did not alternate, we would have consecutive roads of the same type, leading to an impossible configuration due to the odd number of total grafts, which should translate to an even total number of road segments (if perfectly alternating roads). 2. **Illustrating Impossibility for Fewer Grafts:** - Suppose there are 7 grafts. Let's consider roads are alternating and forming a continuous loop without violating the condition. - If roads exactly alternate, we have an odd number of transitions (7 transitions). - This configuration cannot close satisfactorily because even alternating rows, paired properly, would mean an even number of road segments. 3. **Example with 9 Grafts:** - Let’s create a visual representation to help understand the requirement: - Arrange the grafts in a 3x3 grid. - Adhere to the rule, ensuring no point is doubled. - Notice that each row and column must return to the initial setup, forming an alternating path. - Consider drawing roads and ensure after the first two or three roads which complete a loop, the pattern continues undisturbed and no roads intersect incorrectly or repeat. To conclude, after deducing from theoretical and visual representations, it is feasible for the Big Island to consist of an odd number of grafts, here exemplified by 9. **Final Answer:** [ boxed{9} ]"},{"prompt":"John wants to enclose a rectangular garden such that its area is at least 120 sq. ft.

According to the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one row that contains ( leftlceil frac{101}{d} rightrceil ) occurrences of ( i ). 3. **Generalizing to Columns Too:** Similarly, the same reasoning applies to columns.

If the 1st man displaces 2 m³ of water, the 2nd man displaces 3 m³, the 3rd man displaces 4 m³, and so on, with each subsequent man displacing 1 m³ more than the previous, determine the rise in the water level in the tank.","completion":"To find the rise in the water level in the tank, we need to calculate the total volume of water displaced by the 50 men and then divide that by the surface area of the water in the tank. First, let's find the total volume of water displaced by the 50 men. Since the displacement increases by 1 m³ for each man, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) where n is the number of terms. In this case, the first term is 2 m³ (for the 1st man), and the last term will be for the 50th man. Since the displacement increases by 1 m³ each time, the 50th man will displace 2 m³ + (50 - 1) * 1 m³ = 2 m³ + 49 m³ = 51 m³.

Next, we need to find the surface area of the water in the tank. The tank has a sloping base, so the surface area is a trapezoid. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: Area = (a + b)/2 * h where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides, and h is the height (or in this case, the length of the tank). In this case, a = 10 m (the narrower width), b = 30 m (the wider width), and h = 40 m (the length of the tank).

Given that the vertex is at the origin and the focus is on the x-axis, we can write the equation of C as y^{2}=2px where p>0. For the line l: x=1 to intersect C at points P and Q, we substitute x=1 into the parabola's equation, yielding y^{2}=2p cdot 1 = 2p. This gives us y=±sqrt{2p}. Given OP perp OQ, and using the property that the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is -1, we have 1 cdot (-sqrt{2p})sqrt{2p} = -2p = 0, which simplifies to p=frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the equation of parabola C is y^{2}=x. For circle M, since it is tangent to line l at x=1 and its center is at (2,0), the radius must be the distance from (2,0) to the line x=1, which is 1. Thus, the equation of circle M is (x-2)^{2}+y^{2}=1. Therefore, the equations are: - Parabola C: y^{2}=x - Circle M: (x-2)^{2}+y^{2}=1 **(2)** For the position relationship between line A_{2}A_{3} and circle M, we consider two cases: - **Case 1:** When one of A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} is the origin, without loss of generality, let A_{1} be the origin. The equation of line A_{1}A_{2} can be written as kx-y=0. The distance from M(2,0) to this line is 1, leading to frac{|2k|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}}=1. Solving for k gives k=±frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. Solving the equations of line A_{1}A_{2} and the parabola gives x=3. Thus, in this scenario, line A_{2}A_{3} is tangent to circle M. - **Case 2:** When none of A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} is the origin, we use the coordinates A_{i}(y_{i}^{2}, y_{i}) for i=1, 2, 3. The equation of line A_{1}A_{2} simplifies to x-(y_{1}+y_{2})y+y_{1}y_{2}=0. The condition for this line to be tangent to circle M leads to a quadratic equation in y_{2} and y_{3}, which simplifies to ({y}_{1}^{2}-1){y}_{2}^{2}+2{y}_{1}{y}_{2}+3-{y}_{1}^{2}=0. Solving this gives the roots y_{2} and y_{3}, which are used to find the equation of line A_{2}A_{3}. The distance from M to this line is found to be 1, indicating that line A_{2}A_{3} is also tangent to circle M. Therefore, regardless of the specific positions of A_{1}, A_{2}, and A_{3} on C, the line A_{2}A_{3} is always tangent to circle M.

Let's assume the side we know (15 m) is the width (W) of the rectangle, and let the length (L) be the side we want to find. The diagonal (D) forms a right-angled triangle with the length and width of the rectangle.

Prove that there exists at least one smaller equilateral triangle whose three vertices are each a different color.","completion":"To prove the statement, we break it down into a series of logical steps and use the principle of parity (odd/even considerations). 1. **Define Coloring and Parity of Sides:** - Let's classify a side as *odd-colored* if its two endpoints have different colors. We are given that no endpoint on line segment ( BC ) is red, no endpoint on ( CA ) is blue, and no endpoint on ( AB ) is yellow. 2. **Analyzing Small Triangles:** - Consider all small equilateral triangles. If such a triangle has a side not on the boundary of ( triangle ABC ), then this side must be shared with another small triangle. Therefore, within the sum ( S ) defined as the total number of odd-colored sides across all these small triangles, each internal shared side will be counted twice or zero times: [ text{Number of odd-colored internal sides} in {0, 2} ] 3. **Contribution from Boundary Sides:** - The boundary of ( triangle ABC ) comprises three segments ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ), each having endpoints colored as follows: - On ( BC ): endpoints are blue or yellow. - On ( CA ): endpoints are yellow or red. - On ( AB ): endpoints are red or blue. - Since no endpoints on ( BC ) are red, there must be an odd number of transitions between blue and yellow. Similarly, no endpoints on ( CA ) are blue, and no endpoints on ( AB ) are yellow, so each of these line segments must have an odd number of odd-colored sides. 4. **Combining Contributions to ( S ):** - Each boundary segment contributes an odd number of odd-colored sides.

We will start from the higher end and illustrate the feasibility: - **For k=10**, every edge in K_{10} will be uniquely colored with one of the 10 colors, satisfying the condition fully. - **For k=6 to k=9**, construct the complete graph K_{10}. Number vertices from 0 to 9, label edges between vertex i and j with i<j using color corresponding to (i+j) mod 9. For edges involving vertex 9, use i corresponding (2i) mod 9 color.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The speed of the first train is 60 km/hr, and the speed of the second train is 40 km/hr. Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second because the lengths of the trains are given in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (500/18) m/s Relative speed ≈ 27.78 m/s The total distance to be covered for the trains to cross each other is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 210 m + 260 m Total distance = 470 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to cross each other using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 470 m / 27.78 m/s Time ≈ 16.92 seconds So, the two trains will take approximately boxed{16.92} seconds to cross each other."},{"prompt":"Let ( AB ) be the diameter of circle ( odot O ).

If (n = ab) with (a, b > 1), then: [ 2^n - 1 = 2^{ab} - 1 ] Using the formula for the difference of powers, we can write: [ 2^{ab} - 1 = (2^a)^b - 1 ] We can further factorize this using the identity: [ x^b - 1 = (x - 1)(x^{b-1} + x^{b-2} + cdots + x + 1) ] Substituting (x = 2^a), we have: [ 2^{ab} - 1 = (2^a - 1) left(2^{a(b-1)} + 2^{a(b-2)} + cdots + 2^a + 1right) ] 5.

Bounding suggests the contribution of ( p ) is at most ( log(p) (100K p^{-1/3}) frac{2K}{p-1} ). 8. **Summarize the bounding:** Therefore, [ sum_{p < 2K} log(p) (100K p^{-1/3}) frac{2K}{p-1} > epsilon K^2 log K. ] This implies [ sum_{p < 2K} frac{log(p)}{p-1} (p^{-1/3}) > frac{epsilon}{200} log K. ] Taking ( K to infty ), the left-hand side is convergent and the right-hand side is divergent, which is a contradiction.

Let's denote these divisors by ( d_1, d_2, ) and ( d_3 ) with ( d_1 < d_2 < d_3 ). 2. We start by checking if ( 1344 ) is a Norwegian number. The divisors of ( 1344 ) include ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 21, 24, 28, 32, 42, 48, 56, 64, 84, 96, 112, 128, 168, 192, 224, 336, 384, 448, 672, 1344 ). 3.

Now, we need to prove that there is no smaller Norwegian number than ( 1344 ). Assume there exists a smaller ( a < 1344 ) which is Norwegian. Then, there exist distinct divisors ( x_1, y_1, z_1 ) of ( a ) such that: [ x_1 + y_1 + z_1 = 2022 ] 5. Let ( x = frac{a}{x_1}, y = frac{a}{y_1}, z = frac{a}{z_1} ). These are also distinct divisors of ( a ) and: [ frac{a(xy + yz + zx)}{xyz} = 2022 ] 6. Without loss of generality, assume ( x < y < z ). Since ( a < 1344 ), we have: [ a < frac{2}{3} cdot 2022 = 1348 ] Therefore: [ 2022 = a cdot frac{xy + yz + zx}{xyz} < frac{2}{3} cdot 2022 cdot frac{xy + yz + zx}{xyz} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 3xyz < 2xy + 2yz + 2zx ] 7. Since ( x < y < z ), we have: [ 3xyz < 2xy + 2yz + 2zx < 6yz ] This implies: [ x < 2 ] Therefore, ( x = 1 ). 8.

If ( z = 4 ), then: [ frac{19a}{12} = frac{a(1 cdot 3 + 3 cdot 4 + 4 cdot 1)}{3 cdot 4 cdot 1} = 2022 ] This implies: [ a = frac{12}{19} cdot 2022 ] Since ( 19 nmid 12 cdot 2022 ), ( a ) is not an integer. 11.

If ( y = 2 ), then: [ frac{a(3z + 2)}{2z} = frac{a(1 cdot 2 + 2 cdot z + z cdot 1)}{1 cdot 2 cdot z} = 2022 ] This implies: [ a = frac{4044z}{3z + 2} = 1348 - frac{2696}{3z + 2} ] We must have ( 3z + 2 mid 2696 ). Note that ( 2696 = 2^3 cdot 337 ), and ( 337 ) is prime. We cannot have ( 3z + 2 = 2, 4, 8 ) since ( z geq 3 ). We cannot have ( 3z + 2 = 337 ) by mod ( 3 ). The next smallest divisor of ( 2696 ) is ( 674 ), so we have: [ 3z + 2 geq 674 ] This implies: [ 3z geq 672 ] Therefore, ( z geq 224 ). 13.

This occurs when 2 cdot frac{pi}{6} + varphi = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, where k is an integer. Solving this equation with the constraint 0 < varphi < frac{pi}{2} gives us varphi = frac{pi}{6}. Now we can write the function as f(x) = cosleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right). Let's check the given options: A: We substitute x=frac{15pi}{12} into the function to find if it could be an axis of symmetry: fleft(frac{15pi}{12}right) = cosleft(2 cdot frac{5pi}{12}right) = cosleft(frac{5pi}{6}right). The function value at frac{5pi}{6} doesn't necessarily imply the axis of symmetry, and we know that 2x + varphi = 2x + frac{pi}{6} has a period of pi, so the line x=frac{15pi}{12} is not an axis of symmetry (it has a mistake and should be x=frac{5pi}{12} instead). However, the translation might indicate that A is deemed correct. B: On the interval x in left[0, frac{pi}{6}right], 2x + frac{pi}{6} in left[frac{pi}{6}, frac{pi}{2}right], where the cosine function is decreasing. Hence, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on this interval. C: When the graph of f(x) is shifted right by frac{pi}{6} units: y=cos[2(x-frac{pi}{6}) + frac{pi}{6}] = cos(2x - frac{pi}{6}). This does not match the graph of y=cos(2x), so option C is incorrect. D: When x in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right], 2x + frac{pi}{6} in left[frac{pi}{6}, frac{5pi}{6}right]. Within this interval, the minimum value of the cosine function is at x = frac{5pi}{6}, which gives us f(x) = cosleft(2 cdot frac{5pi}{6} + frac{pi}{6}right)=cos(pi) = -1. Thus, the minimum value of f(x) on left[0, frac{pi}{2}right] is indeed -1. Therefore, Option C is the incorrect statement.

Next, we find the magnitude of z using the formula for the magnitude of a complex number, which is sqrt{text{real part}^2 + text{imaginary part}^2}: |z| = sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = sqrt{4 + 9} = sqrt{13}.

To find ( A' ), solve for the intersection of the line ( AC ) with ( y = x ).

Solving this, ( x = -15 ), which is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the coordinate system constraints (both ( x ) and ( y ) should be positive when intersecting ( y = x )). Let's reevaluate the coordinates and ensure the slope calculation is correct. Recalculating, since ( y = x ) and the line is ( y = frac{4}{3}x + 5 ), setting ( x = y ) gives ( y = frac{4}{3}y + 5 ). This results in ( y - frac{4}{3}y = 5 ), simplifying to ( frac{-1}{3}y = -5 ), hence ( y = 15 ). Thus, ( A' = (15, 15) ). 3.

We need to find T given the speeds of the train excluding and including stoppages. First, we need to determine the distance covered by the train in one hour without any stoppages. Since the speed of the train excluding stoppages is 42 kmph, the distance covered in one hour (which is 60 minutes) would be 42 km. Now, let's find out the distance covered by the train in one hour including stoppages. The speed of the train including stoppages is 27 kmph, so the distance covered in one hour with stoppages would be 27 km. The difference in distance covered by the train in one hour with and without stoppages is the distance that would have been covered during the stoppages. This distance is 42 km - 27 km = 15 km. Since the train would have covered 15 km during the stoppages if it had not stopped, we can calculate the time it would take to cover this distance at the speed of the train without stoppages. The speed of the train without stoppages is 42 kmph, so the time to cover 15 km is given by: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 15 km / 42 kmph To convert the speed to km per minute, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 42 kmph = 42 km / 60 minutes = 0.7 km/minute Now, we can calculate the time to cover 15 km: Time = 15 km / 0.7 km/minute Time = 21.43 minutes This time, 21.43 minutes, is the overall duration of stoppages per hour (T).

We know from geometry that the area of the triangle formed by the medians of a triangle is frac{3}{4} of the area of the original triangle. 2. **General Formula for the Circumradius:** For any triangle with sides (a, b, c), the circumradius (R) can be expressed as: [ abc = 4R cdot S ] where (S) is the area of the triangle. 3. **Inequality to Prove:** We are required to prove that for an acute-angled triangle, the product of the medians exceeds frac{5}{8} of the product of the sides: [ m_{a} m_{b} m_{c} > frac{5}{8} abc ] where (m_a, m_b,) and (m_c) are the medians corresponding to the sides (a, b,) and (c) respectively. 4. **Selection for Convenience:** For calculation simplicity, let's assume one of the triangle's sides is (2d) and the corresponding median to this side is (m). Since our triangle is acute-angled, we have the relationship (m > d). 5. **Introducing Cosine Theorem:** Let (t) denote the cosine of the acute angle formed by this median with side (2d). Thus, (0 leq t < frac{d}{m}), keeping in mind the properties of the acute-angled triangle. 6. **Expressing Relationships:** We express the sides and medians in terms of (d), (m), and (t). Substituting these into the inequality, we derive: [ m_a m_b m_c > frac{5}{8} abc ] This transforms to: [ m^{2}left(9 d^{2} + m^{2}right)^{2} - 25 d^{2}left(d^{2} + m^{2}right)^{2} > t^{2} d^{2} m^{2}left(64 m^{2} - 100 d^{2}right) ] 7. **Simplifying the Expression:** The left-hand part of the inequality reduces to: [ left(m^{2} - 4 d m + 5 d^{2}right)left(m^{2} + 4 d m + 5 d^{2}right)left(m^{2} - d^{2}right) ] Since (m > d), the left-hand side is indeed positive. 8. **Considerations for Special Case:** If (m = d) (forming a right-angled triangle), the left-hand side of the inequality cannot be less than the right-hand side. 9. **Further Examination:** If (d < m leq frac{5}{4}d), the right-hand side of the inequality is non-positive, making the inequality valid. 10. **Final Case:** For (m > frac{5}{4}d), one can show that the right-hand side is lesser when evaluated under the additional condition (t = frac{d}{m}). Since proving inequality for a right-angled triangle is effective, the broader consideration concludes for all acute triangles. Therefore, we conclude that the given inequality holds for all non-obtuse triangles except for specific cases like isosceles right triangles, confirming our statement.

Therefore, we have: [a = 4, quad b = 3, quad c = -2] Adding these values together: [a + b + c = 4 + 3 + (-2) = 5] Taking the square root of the sum: [sqrt{a + b + c} = sqrt{5}] To find the integer part of sqrt{5}, we note that sqrt{5} is between 2 and 3 because 2^2 = 4 < 5 < 9 = 3^2.

So, the speed of the man in m/s is: 8 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 8000 m / 3600 s = 2.222 m/s The train takes 17.998560115190788 seconds to pass the man. Since the man is also moving in the same direction, we need to consider the relative speed between the train and the man. Let's denote the speed of the train as Vt (in m/s). The relative speed (Vr) between the train and the man is the difference between the speed of the train and the speed of the man because they are moving in the same direction. Vr = Vt - 2.222 m/s The train covers its own length (250 m) in 17.998560115190788 seconds at the relative speed. So, we have the equation: 250 m = Vr * 17.998560115190788 s Substituting Vr with (Vt - 2.222 m/s), we get: 250 m = (Vt - 2.222 m/s) * 17.998560115190788 s Now, we solve for Vt: 250 m = Vt * 17.998560115190788 s - 2.222 m/s * 17.998560115190788 s 250 m + (2.222 m/s * 17.998560115190788 s) = Vt * 17.998560115190788 s 250 m + 39.996 m = Vt * 17.998560115190788 s 289.996 m = Vt * 17.998560115190788 s Vt = 289.996 m / 17.998560115190788 s Vt ≈ 16.112 m/s Now, we convert the speed of the train back to kmph: Vt (in kmph) = 16.112 m/s * (3600 s / 1000 m) Vt (in kmph) ≈ 16.112 * 3.6 kmph Vt (in kmph) ≈ 57.99 kmph Therefore, the speed of the train is approximately boxed{57.99} kmph."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest number which, when increased by some number, is divisible by 8, 11, and 24?

The rise in water level indicates the volume of water displaced by the cube, which is equal to the volume of the cube itself. Since the base of the vessel is 20 cm by 15 cm, the volume of water displaced (and thus the volume of the cube) can be calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the rise in water level. Volume of the cube (V_cube) = Area of the base (A_base) * Rise in water level (h_rise) A_base = length * width A_base = 20 cm * 15 cm A_base = 300 cm² h_rise = 16.376666666666665 cm V_cube = A_base * h_rise V_cube = 300 cm² * 16.376666666666665 cm V_cube = 4913 cm³ (approximately) Now, to find the edge length of the cube (L), we take the cube root of the volume: L = V_cube^(1/3) L = 4913^(1/3) Using a calculator, we find: L ≈ 17.1 cm Therefore, the edge length of the cube is approximately boxed{17.1} cm."},{"prompt":"Given that P = (sqrt{2023}+sqrt{2024}), Q = (sqrt{2023}sqrt{2024}), R = (sqrt{2023}sqrt{2024}), and S = (sqrt{2024}sqrt{2023}), find PQRS.","completion":"1.

What score does she need to get on the sixth quiz to make the arithmetic mean of the six scores equal 93?","completion":"To solve for the score Emily needs on her sixth quiz to achieve an arithmetic mean of 93 for all six quizzes, we follow these steps: 1. **Simplification by Adjusting Scores**: We start by simplifying the arithmetic by subtracting 90 from each of Emily's scores. This adjustment is made because we aim to simplify the numbers we're working with, making the calculations easier. The adjusted scores are: - For 92, the adjusted score is 92 - 90 = 2. - For 95, the adjusted score is 95 - 90 = 5. - For 87, the adjusted score is 87 - 90 = -3. - For 89, the adjusted score is 89 - 90 = -1. - For 100, the adjusted score is 100 - 90 = 10. 2. **Calculating the Desired Adjusted Average**: Since we want the average of the six scores to be 93, and we've adjusted all scores by subtracting 90, the new target average becomes 93 - 90 = 3. 3. **Determining the Total Sum Needed for the Desired Average**: To achieve an average of 3 for six quizzes, the total sum of the adjusted scores must be 6 times 3 = 18. 4. **Summing Emily's Adjusted Scores**: The sum of Emily's first five adjusted scores is 2 + 5 - 3 - 1 + 10 = 13. 5. **Finding the Required Sixth Score**: To reach the total sum of 18 with the sixth score, we calculate the difference between the desired total sum and the sum of the first five adjusted scores: 18 - 13 = 5. This means the adjusted score needed for the sixth quiz is 5. 6. **Reverting to Original Score Scale**: To find the actual score needed on the sixth quiz, we add back the 90 we initially subtracted: 5 + 90 = 95. Therefore, the score Emily needs on her sixth quiz to achieve an average of 93 across all six quizzes is boxed{95}."},{"prompt":"What is the sum of the greatest common factor of 8 and 12 and the least common multiple of 8 and 12?","completion":"1.

In how many hours can D, working alone, complete one of these jobs?","completion":"Let's denote the rate at which A works as A_rate and the rate at which D works as D_rate. The rate in this context is the fraction of the job completed per hour. A completes the job in 3 hours, so A_rate = 1 job / 3 hours = 1/3 job/hour. When A and D work together, they complete the job in 2 hours. Their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates, so we have: A_rate + D_rate = 1 job / 2 hours = 1/2 job/hour. We already know A_rate = 1/3 job/hour, so we can substitute that into the equation: 1/3 + D_rate = 1/2. Now we need to solve for D_rate. To do this, we subtract A_rate from both sides of the equation: D_rate = 1/2 - 1/3. To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case: D_rate = (3/6) - (2/6) = 1/6 job/hour. This means D, working alone, completes 1/6 of the job per hour. To find out how many hours it takes for D to complete one job, we take the reciprocal of D_rate: Time for D to complete one job = 1 / D_rate = 1 / (1/6) = 6 hours.

Calculating the LCM: - For the prime factor 2, the maximum exponent in the factors is 1. - For the prime factor 3, the maximum exponent in the factors is 2. - For the prime factor 5, the maximum exponent in the factors is 1. Thus, the LCM of 18 and 30 is 2^1cdot3^2cdot5^1 = 90. Now, we need to find the smallest y that has 24 factors and is at least 90. Since y must be a multiple of 90, we can try extending the factorization of 90: - Prime factorization of 90=2^1cdot3^2cdot5^1. - To get exactly 24 factors, the total number of factors (e_1+1)(e_2+1)(e_3+1) = 24, where e_1, e_2, and e_3 are the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 respectively in the prime factorization of y. Testing for factors, if we set: - e_1 = 3 (for 2, i.e., 2^3), - e_2 = 2 (for 3, i.e., 3^2), - e_3 = 2 (for 5, i.e., 5^2), Then (3+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 4cdot3cdot3 = 36 (too many factors). We need to adjust to get exactly 24 factors. Let’s adjust e_1: - e_1 = 3, - e_2 = 2, - e_3 = 1, Now (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4cdot3cdot2 = 24. This gives us y = 2^3cdot3^2cdot5^1 = 8cdot9cdot5 = 360.

Half the birds were sold, so the number of birds left is: 12 birds / 2 = 6 birds 3 puppies were adopted, so the number of puppies left is: 9 puppies - 3 puppies = 6 puppies The pet store owner has 25 animals left, including the birds, puppies, cats, and the remaining spiders. We know the number of birds, puppies, and cats left, so we can calculate the number of spiders left.

If the second person lies, then the statement would be false, implying that there are two people among them who are not liars. The known statuses are: - The first person (a knight). - The third person (a liar). - This scenario cannot hold as we have established one liar and one knight.

Hence, the sum of the floor functions is simply the number of integer points inside the rectangle. 6. The number of integer points inside the rectangle is the product of the number of possible (x) values and the number of possible (y) values. Since (x) ranges from 1 to (frac{p-1}{2}), there are (frac{p-1}{2}) possible (x) values. Similarly, there are (frac{q-1}{2}) possible (y) values. 7.

Since B includes values from -5 to 1 and A includes values from -3 to 2, the intersection will include values from the higher of the two lower bounds and up to the lower of the two upper bounds. This gives us -3 to 1. However, since A does not include its endpoints, and B includes 1 but not -5, the intersection A cap B will include values from -3 (not included) to 1 (included).

Assume such a function ( f ) exists and let ( f(0) = a ). Thus, [ f(f(0)) = f(a) = 1 ] 2. Now consider ( f(a + 1) ). We have: [ f(f(a)) = f(1) = 2 ] 3. Similarly, we apply the same logic for other non-negative integers: [ begin{aligned} f(f(2)) &= 3, f(f(3)) &= 4, vdots f(f(a - 1)) &= a end{aligned} ] 4.

[ text{Ways to color the central part} = 3 ] 2. **Coloring the 12 Sectors**: - For the remaining 12 sectors, we must use the remaining two colors, as each of these sectors shares a border with the central part. This means that the color of each sector must differ from the central part's color. 3. **Initial Sector Coloring**: - We choose one sector (let's say sector 1) and color it in one of the 2 remaining colors. [ text{Ways to color sector 1} = 2 ] 4. **Automatic Coloring of Adjacent Sectors**: - Once sector 1 is painted, the color of the following sectors is automatically established by the requirement that no two adjacent sections share the same color. This color alternates between the remaining two colors ensuring adjacent sectors are different in color. - Sector 2 is painted in the remaining color (different from sector 1 and center). - Sector 3 is painted in the color of sector 1. - And so on for all 12 sectors, alternating between the two colors. 5. **Verification**: - This alternating pattern ensures that not only do no two adjacent sectors share the same color, but also the pair comprising sector 12 and sector 1 is adequately painted differently. [ text{Total ways to paint all sectors} = 3 (text{choices for central part}) times 2 (text{choices for sector 1}) = 6 ] # Conclusion: After ensuring all steps meet the conditions of the problem, the number of ways to color all 13 parts of the circle such that no two adjacent parts are the same color is: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"The approximate range where the root of the function f(x) = ln x + 3x 10 is located is ( ).

Since the sum of two increasing functions is also increasing, f(x) is an increasing function on its domain. Thus, f(x) can have at most one root.

If two adjacent sages have the same opinion, they do not change their opinion in the next minute. Hence, they remain unchanged in subsequent moments as well. Therefore, any two adjacent identical signs create a 'stable' pair. 3. **Definition of Stable Signs**: Let us define a sign as *stable* if it is next to at least one identical sign. Since the number of sages (101) is odd, there must be at least one stable sign at any given time. By definition, any stable sign will not change. If there is a stable sign adjacent to an unstable sign, the unstable sign changes to become the same as the stable sign, thus also becoming stable. 4. **Increase in Stable Signs**: Let's assume that at some moment at least one sign changes. This implies there are unstable signs. Because there is a stable sign (as it's an odd number of signs), the number of stable signs increases whenever there's a change in signs. Specifically, any unstable sign adjacent to a stable sign becomes stable after changing. 5. **Induction Argument**: Since the number of unstable signs strictly decreases whenever signs change (leading to more stable signs), eventually, all signs will stabilize. Once every sign is stable, no further changes will occur. Consequently, the opinions of the sages will stop changing. **Conclusion**: Through the process described, we establish that after some finite amount of time, all opinions will stabilize, and no further changes will occur.

To understand why one of the numbers is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the given numbers, consider the properties of prime factorization. Each number can be expressed as a product of prime factors raised to their respective powers.

Suppose we have numbers (a) and (b). If (a = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k}) and (b = p_1^{f_1} p_2^{f_2} cdots p_k^{f_k}), then the LCM of (a) and (b) is given by: [ text{LCM}(a,b) = p_1^{max(e_1, f_1)} p_2^{max(e_2, f_2)} cdots p_k^{max(e_k, f_k)} ] If (b) is one of the given numbers and (b) incorporates all the prime factors of (a) and their maximum exponents are already present in (b), then: [ text{LCM}(a,b) = b ] Hence, (b) is the LCM of (a) and (b). 2.

For the GCD to be one of the numbers, it must be a divisor of all numbers in question. Suppose we have numbers (a, b, c,) etc. If (b) is one of these numbers, and all other numbers are divisible by (b), then: [ text{GCD}(a,b,c, ldots) = b ] It implies that (b) is a common divisor and is the largest such divisor among the given numbers. # Conclusion: Thus, the LCM being one of the numbers means that this number contains all the prime factors found in the other numbers with at least the highest powers, ensuring it is a multiple of all numbers.

Thus, Vasya ran only 60 - 9 = 51 meters by the time Petya finished. Let ( v_P ) and ( v_V ) be the speeds of Petya and Vasya respectively.

Therefore: [ angle CMA = angle CAM = 90^circ - alpha ] 6. **Angle Calculation in triangle CMN:** Consider triangle CMN: [ angle CMN = 180^circ - angle BMN - angle CMA = 180^circ - 2alpha - (90^circ - alpha) = 90^circ - alpha ] 7. **Bisector Properties in triangle MNH:** Since angle CMN = 90^circ - alpha matches angle CAM, and CM is a bisector of angle AMD, we also examine the bisectors of inner and outer angles. 8. **Intersection and Concurrency Concepts:** Since BD is the bisector of angle BNM (an internal angle of triangle BNM) and CM is the bisector of angle AMC (an external angle adjacent to triangle BNM), their intersection point H is the excenter of triangle BNM corresponding to the angle at N. 9. **Conclusion on NH as Angle Bisector:** Consequently, in triangle BNM, point H being the excenter suggests that NH must be the angle bisector of angle MNC.

The limits of integration change accordingly: when ( x = 0 ), ( t = -theta ); and when ( x = 2pi ), ( t = 2pi - theta ). Thus, we have: [ I = int_{-theta}^{2pi - theta} sin 8(t + theta) |sin t| , dt ] 2. Since the integrand is a periodic function with period ( 2pi ), we can shift the limits of integration to a symmetric interval around zero: [ I = int_{-pi}^{pi} sin 8(t + theta) |sin t| , dt ] 3. We use the angle addition formula for sine: [ sin 8(t + theta) = sin 8t cos 8theta + cos 8t sin 8theta ] Substituting this into the integral, we get: [ I = int_{-pi}^{pi} (sin 8t cos 8theta + cos 8t sin 8theta) |sin t| , dt ] This can be split into two integrals: [ I = cos 8theta int_{-pi}^{pi} sin 8t |sin t| , dt + sin 8theta int_{-pi}^{pi} cos 8t |sin t| , dt ] 4. Notice that (sin 8t |sin t|) is an odd function because (sin 8t) is odd and (|sin t|) is even. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around zero is zero: [ int_{-pi}^{pi} sin 8t |sin t| , dt = 0 ] Therefore, the first term vanishes: [ I = sin 8theta int_{-pi}^{pi} cos 8t |sin t| , dt ] 5. Since (|sin t|) is even and (cos 8t) is even, their product is even. Thus, we can simplify the integral by considering only the interval from (0) to (pi) and doubling it: [ I = 2 sin 8theta int_0^{pi} cos 8t |sin t| , dt ] On the interval (0 leq t leq pi), (|sin t| = sin t), so: [ I = 2 sin 8theta int_0^{pi} cos 8t sin t , dt ] 6.

However, we must remember that Yolanda had already walked for 1 hour before Bob started, so she had already covered 3 miles (since 3 miles/hour * 1 hour = 3 miles). Therefore, by the time they meet, Yolanda would have walked a total of 3t + 3 miles. Since they are walking towards each other from opposite ends of a 24-mile distance, the sum of the distances they walked when they meet will be equal to 24 miles.

This hints at the compactness and simplicity of their relationship. We start by checking small odd numbers: **Step-by-step Calculation:** 1. Let's first assume (a = b = c = 1): - For (a = b = c = 1): - ( (1 cdot 1) + 1 = 2 ) is divisible by (2 cdot 1 = 2). - ( (1 cdot 1) + 1 = 2 ) is divisible by (2 cdot 1 = 2). - ( (1 cdot 1) + 1 = 2 ) is divisible by (2 cdot 1 = 2). All conditions are satisfied. 2. Can there be any other triplets? - If any of (a), (b), or (c) were greater than 1, say (a > 1), (b > 1) or (c > 1), then ((a cdot b) + 1) would not necessarily yield divisibility by (2c) without additional constraints. Conclusively, the only natural numbers that satisfy such compact mutually prime and additional divisibility constraints are (a = 1), (b = 1), and (c = 1). # Conclusion: Hence, the only valid triplet of natural numbers that satisfy the given conditions is ((1, 1, 1)).

If his brother takes 8 hours to read a book, it takes John 15 hours to read 3 books. What is the percentage by which John reads faster than his brother?","completion":"First, let's find out how long it takes John to read one book. Since John can read 3 books in 15 hours, he can read one book in 15 hours / 3 books = 5 hours. Now, we know that John's brother takes 8 hours to read one book, while John takes 5 hours to read one book. To find the percentage by which John reads faster than his brother, we can use the following formula: Percentage Increase = (Increase / Original number) * 100% In this case, the \\"Increase\\" is the difference in time it takes for John's brother to read a book and the time it takes John to read a book, which is 8 hours - 5 hours = 3 hours. The \\"Original number\\" is the time it takes John's brother to read a book, which is 8 hours. So, the percentage by which John reads faster than his brother is: Percentage Increase = (3 hours / 8 hours) * 100% = 0.375 * 100% = 37.5% John reads boxed{37.5%} faster than his brother."},{"prompt":"A factory producing tennis balls stores them in either big boxes, 25 balls per box, or small boxes, some balls per box. If 104 freshly manufactured balls are to be stored and the least number of balls that can be left unboxed is 5, how many balls are in each small box?","completion":"Let's denote the number of balls in each small box as ( x ). We know that the least number of balls that can be left unboxed is 5. This means that the number of balls that can be boxed is ( 104 - 5 = 99 ). We also know that big boxes can hold 25 balls each. So, we can use the big boxes to store as many of the 99 balls as possible. The number of big boxes used will be ( leftlfloor frac{99}{25} rightrfloor ), where ( leftlfloor cdot rightrfloor ) denotes the floor function, which rounds down to the nearest integer. ( leftlfloor frac{99}{25} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 3.96 rightrfloor = 3 ) So, we can use 3 big boxes to store ( 3 times 25 = 75 ) balls. Now, we have ( 99 - 75 = 24 ) balls left that need to be stored in small boxes. Since we want to minimize the number of balls left unboxed, we want to find the largest number of small boxes that can be used to store these 24 balls. This means that the number of balls in each small box must be a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. However, we want to minimize the number of unboxed balls, so we should choose the largest divisor that is less than 25 (since 25 is the size of the big box and we cannot have a small box of the same size or larger). The largest divisor of 24 that is less than 25 is 24 itself. However, if we choose 24, we would only use one small box, and we want to use the least number of boxes possible. The next largest divisor is 12. If we choose 12 balls per small box, we can use 2 small boxes to store the remaining 24 balls. Therefore, each small box contains boxed{12} balls."},{"prompt":"Find the equations of the following lines: (1) Given the line l: x+2y3=0, find the equation of the line parallel to l and at a distance of 1.

According to the given information, the cost price of 20 articles is equal to the selling price of 16 articles. Therefore, we can write the equation: 20C = 16S Now, we want to find the ratio of the selling price to the cost price to determine the profit or loss percentage. We can rearrange the equation to solve for S in terms of C: S = (20C / 16) Simplify the fraction: S = (5C / 4) Now we can see that the selling price is 5/4 times the cost price. This means that for every 4 units of cost, the merchant sells the article for 5 units. The profit per article is the selling price minus the cost price: Profit per article = S - C Profit per article = (5C / 4) - C To find the profit in terms of C, we need to have a common denominator: Profit per article = (5C - 4C) / 4 Profit per article = C / 4 The profit per article is 1/4 of the cost price. To find the profit percentage, we divide the profit per article by the cost price and multiply by 100: Profit percentage = (Profit per article / C) * 100 Profit percentage = (C / 4C) * 100 Profit percentage = (1 / 4) * 100 Profit percentage = 25% Therefore, the merchant makes a profit of boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"Let the function f(x)= sqrt {3}sin xcos x+cos ^{2}x+a (1) Write down the smallest positive period of the function f(x) and the interval where it is monotonically decreasing; (2) When xinleft[ dfrac {pi}{6}, dfrac {pi}{3}right], the sum of the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) is dfrac {3}{2}.

For instance, j = 10 leads to 10cdot11cdot12cdot13 where 10 and 12 are divisible by 2, and 12 is also divisible by 4, but this case does not cover all possible j. 2. **Divisibility by 11:** Since m is divisible by 11, at least one of j, j+1, j+2, j+3 is divisible by 11. 3. **Divisibility by 22, 33, and 66:** - Given that m is divisible by 11 and 2 (from the divisible of 8 check), m is divisible by 22. - Since m is divisible by 11 and 3 (since among any four consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3), m is divisible by 33. - Multiplying the conditions for 22 and 3, m is also divisible by 66. 4. **Divisibility by 44:** - For m to be divisible by 44, it needs to be divisible by both 11 and 4. While we have established divisibility by 11, divisibility by 4 for four consecutive numbers is not guaranteed (as shown in the divisibility by 8 analysis). Conclusion: Since m is not necessarily divisible by 44, the correct answer is 44.

We need to show that transforming alpha into beta by these operations implies that beta majorizes alpha. Let's consider these transformations in more detail: - **First Operation:** Changing (k, j, i) rightarrow (k-1, j+1, i) - This decreases alpha_1 by 1 and increases alpha_2 by 1. - It can be seen as moving a \\"brick\\" in the Young diagram one row down. - **Second Operation:** Changing (k, j, i) rightarrow (k-1, j, i + 1) - This decreases alpha_1 by 1 and increases alpha_3 by 1. - It can be seen as moving a \\"brick\\" from the top row to the bottom row directly. - **Third Operation:** Changing (k, j, i) rightarrow (k, j-1, i + 1) - This decreases alpha_2 by 1 and increases alpha_3 by 1. - It translates a “brick” down to the lowest level. 4. **Ensure Operations Lead to Majorization:** After performing these operations, we arrive at vectors that maintain the initial's summatory identity but shifted elements. Suppose alpha neq beta. To check if beta can be achieved from alpha through a sequence of these operations: - Each operation changes the diagram slightly, but each step we've shown via the Young diagram interpretation stays within the majorization constraints. - Since each operation involves redistributing weights among the parts of the partition (i.e., from k to j or i), any obtained partition through legal moves still maintains the weak upper bound condition required by majorization. Therefore, after a series of such legal steps, if beta can be obtained from alpha, beta must majorize alpha. Conversely, suppose alpha succ beta. Then historically from the definition, beta must be derivable by a suitable sequence of these legal operations.

Pour the 7 liters from the 7-liter vessel into the 5-liter vessel, leaving 2 liters in the 7-liter vessel. 3. Empty the 5-liter vessel back into the 12-liter bucket, which leaves still 2 liters in the 7-liter vessel. 4. Pour the 2 liters left in the 7-liter vessel into the 5-liter vessel.

This is equivalent to finding when: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{2l - 1}{2m - 1} ] Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. **Express any amount of milk in terms of a and b:** Consider the general equation for the amount of milk: [ c = m cdot a + l cdot b ] where m and l are integers. 2. **Condition for dividing by 2:** The problem requires that frac{a + b}{2} liters can be achieved. Hence, [ frac{a + b}{2} = m cdot a + l cdot b ] 3. **Simplify the equation:** Multiply both sides by 2 to remove the fraction: [ a + b = 2m cdot a + 2l cdot b ] 4. **Rearrange the equation:** [ a + b = 2ma + 2lb ] [ a - 2ma = 2lb - b ] [ a (1 - 2m) = b (2l - 1) ] 5. **Solve for frac{a}{b} :** [ frac{a}{b} = frac{2l - 1}{1 - 2m} ] For the fractions to be simplified, frac{a}{b} must be a rational fraction (that is, a fraction of two integers). This is achieved when the numerator and denominator are odd, meaning a and b must share a factor to achieve this simplification. # Conclusion: boxed{text{For } frac{a}{b} text{ to be rational, and to divide the milk equally the factors of } a text{ and } b} must be in an irreducible fraction where both numerator and denominator are odd."},{"prompt":"Choose 3 out of 5 different gifts to give to 3 classmates, the total number of different ways to give the gifts is: A: 240 ways B: 125 ways C: 120 ways D: 60 way","completion":"To solve the problem of choosing 3 out of 5 different gifts to give to 3 classmates and determining the total number of different ways to give the gifts, we follow these steps: 1. **Choosing 3 out of 5 Gifts**: The number of ways to choose 3 gifts out of 5 can be calculated using the combination formula, which is simplified as follows: [ frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10. ] This step calculates the number of unique sets of 3 gifts that can be chosen from 5. 2. **Distributing the 3 Gifts to 3 Classmates**: Once we have chosen 3 gifts, we need to consider the number of ways to distribute these gifts to 3 classmates.

Since (x mid 2y + 1), it implies (2y + 1 = kx) for some integer (k). Similarly, (y mid 2x + 1) implies (2x + 1 = my) for some integer (m). From (x leq y), it follows that (2x + 1 leq 2y + 1).

Hence, no pairs ((x, y)) exist under this condition. - **Case 3: (y = 1)**: [ y = 1 ] Substituting (y = 1) into the condition (y mid 2x + 1): [ 1 mid 2x + 1 ] Which is always true for any positive integer (x). To satisfy (x leq y = 1), we must have: [ x = 1 implies (1, 1) ] Therefore, for the scenario (x leq y), the viable points are: [ (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 7) ] 4. **Analyzing the Condition for (x > y)**: Applying similar logic for the case (x > y): - **Case 1: (2x + 1 = y):** This cannot happen as it conflicts with (x > y). - **Case 2: (2y = 2x + 1):** Already proven impossible. - **Case 3: (y = 2x + 1)** is analogous to before but now for different points.

We analyze the sign of f'(x) to determine the monotonicity: - If m leq 0, then f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - m > 0 for all x > 0, which means f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). - If m > 0, we need to solve for when f'(x) > 0: frac{1}{x} - m > 0 Rightarrow frac{1}{x} > m Rightarrow x < frac{1}{m}. And when f'(x) < 0: frac{1}{x} - m < 0 Rightarrow frac{1}{x} < m Rightarrow x > frac{1}{m}. In this case, f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{m}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{m}, +infty). In summary, for m leq 0, f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty); for m > 0, f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{m}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{m}, +infty).

When m > 0, we need to ensure that the maximum value of f(x) does not exceed zero. This maximum value occurs at the critical point x = frac{1}{m}, thus we compute fleft(frac{1}{m}right): fleft(frac{1}{m}right) = lnleft(frac{1}{m}right) - mleft(frac{1}{m}right) + m = lnleft(frac{1}{m}right) + 1.

The medians M M_1, K K_1, and N N_1 intersect at the centroid O of the triangle. 3. To understand the relative lengths of the medians, compare elements of triangles K M M_1 and N M M_1: - Since M_1 is the midpoint of K N, we have K M_1 = M_1 N. - Both triangles share the common side M M_1. - Given K M < M N by the construction of the triangle, the side lengths result in: [ angle M M_1 K < angle M M_1 N ] Thus, we have established the relationship between the medians in these triangles. 4.

I took courses in weather science at Eastern Kentucky University, but I majored in broadcasting news. _How did you finally become a weatherman?_ My first job in the early 1980s was at the local TV station in Paducah, Kentucky. I did everything from turning on the lights in the morning to writing and delivering morning news. I put together weather forecasts, and became interested in them. _Back then, how did you forecast weather?_ Independent companies collected computer information that showed, for example, how a single weather system might split into snow or snow mixed with rain. The information was often opposite and the job of a weatherman was to study the information and make the best educated guess about the storm. _Has weather forecasting changed much with new technology?_ Advanced computers, satellites, and Doppler radar (sound waves used to track storms) have made forecasting more exact. But we still know very little about how weather is shaped. So far, we just have theories. _Any advice for children who’d like to become weather scientists?_ To me, weather is the most exciting field in the world. There are still so many more questions about weather than answers. After all, if we can’t foresee floods or hurricanes, how safe a society are we?

This is a consequence of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. 4. **Key Insight:** - Not all of (x_1, x_2, x_3) can be non-negative. Without loss of generality, assume (x_2) is negative. 5. **Chicken McNugget Theorem:** - For sufficiently large (Z in mathbb{Z}^+), there exist positive integers (M, N) such that (Z = aM + cN). 6. **Constructing Specific Integers:** - Let (n_1, n_2, n_3) be positive integers such that (n_2 + x_2 = 0), (n_1 + x_1 > 0), and (n_3 + x_3 > 0). - Consider the expression: [ a(2n_1 + x_1) + b(2n_2 + x_2) + c(2n_3 + x_3) > ac + C ] where (C) is a sufficiently large constant. 7. **Divisibility Conditions:** - We need to show: [ a mid bn_2 + cn_3, quad b mid an_1 + cn_3 - ac, quad c mid an_1 + bn_2 ] This is possible when (a, b, c) are pairwise distinct primes. 8. **Good Rectangles:** - A rectangle is \\"good\\" if it can be covered by squares of size (a times a), (b times b), or (c times c). - Note that (a times ac) and (c times ac) are good. Hence, ((aM + cN) times ac) is also good. 9. **Combining Rectangles:** - Consider the rectangle ((ac + aM + cN) times (ac + aM + cN)). This can be partitioned into four rectangles of size ((an_1 + bn_2 + cn_3) times (a(n_1 + x_1) + b(n_2 + x_2) + c(n_3 + x_3))) and one middle (1 times 1). 10. **Final Partition:** - We need to show that the (1 times 1) cell contains an even number. - Since (a(n_1 + x_1) + b(n_2 + x_2) + c(n_3 + x_3) = a(n_1 + x_1) + c(n_3 + x_3)), we can partition the rectangle into (a times (an_1 + bn_2 + cn_3)) and (c times (an_1 + bn_2 + cn_3)). - Since (a mid an_1 + bn_2 + cn_3) and (c mid an_1 + bn_2 + cn_3), we can further partition these rectangles into (a times a) and (c times c) squares, respectively, which are good. 11. **Conclusion:** - Since every (a times a), (b times b), and (c times c) square sums to an even number, and we can cover the entire table with such squares, every number in the table must be even.

Given 2023 = 252 times 8 + 7, we can see that when d = 252, a_{1} is minimized because any larger d would make a_{1} negative or non-integer, which contradicts the given conditions. 5. Substituting d = 252 into the equation for a_{1}: [ a_{1} = 2023 - 8 times 252 = 2023 - 2016 = 7 ] Therefore, the minimum value of a_{1}, while ensuring all terms of the sequence are positive integers, is boxed{7}."},{"prompt":"alculate how many seconds it eill take for 4 bells to toll together again , given that they begin to toll together respectively at the intervals of 5 , 8 , 11 and 15 seconds . ?","completion":"To find out when the four bells will toll together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their tolling intervals.

We want to maximize the number of employees who take the subway, which is (1/3)P + (1/4)F. To maximize this number, we should maximize the number of part-time employees who take the subway because (1/3) is greater than (1/4).

Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Substitution with m = n**: Consider the special case when m = n. This gives us: m^{2} + f(m) mid m f(m) + m. This implies: m^{2} + f(m) mid m f(m) + m - m (m^{2} + f(m)) = m f(m) + m - m^{3} - m f(m) = m - m^{3}.

There are binom{5}{2} = 10 ways to choose the two books that go together, but we divide by 2 to account for the identical nature of the bags, giving 5 ways. bullet **Case 4:** Three books go into one bag, one book goes into another, and one more book into another. There are binom{5}{3} = 10 ways to choose the three books that go together. The remaining two books go into separate bags, and since the bags are identical, it doesn't matter which book goes into which bag. bullet **Case 5:** Two books go into one bag, two books go into another bag, and the fifth book goes into a third bag. Choosing two books for one bag can be done in binom{5}{2} = 10 ways, and choosing two out of the remaining three for another bag can be done in binom{3}{2} = 3 ways. The last book goes into the last bag. The total for this case needs to be divided by 2 to account for identical bags swapping, giving frac{10 cdot 3}{2} = 15 ways. bullet **Case 6:** Each book goes into a separate bag except one bag remains empty. There are binom{5}{1} = 5 ways to choose the book that goes into a bag by itself, with the remaining books each going into their own bag.

We will partition them into groups based on their cube roots. Specifically, group the numbers by their proximity to integers when considering their cube roots. Formally, these groups can be defined as: [ (1, 2, ldots, 7), quad (8, 9, ldots, 26), quad (27, 28, ldots, 63), ldots, left(k^3, k^3+1, ldots, (k+1)^3 - 1right), ldots, (1728, 1729, ldots, 2016) ] Each group contains numbers whose cube roots fall between some integer ( k ) and ( k+1 ). 2. **Calculate the Number of Groups:** To find the number of groups, observe that: - Group 1 includes numbers 1 to 7. - Group 2 includes numbers 8 to 26. - Group 3 includes numbers 27 to 63. - The last group includes numbers 1728 to 2016.

First, let's find out how many people came before the start of the concert: 3/4 of 900 = 0.75 * 900 = 675 people Now, let's find out how many people were left after accounting for those who came before the concert and those who did not go: 900 (total tickets sold) - 675 (arrived before the concert) - 20 (did not go) = 205 people Out of these 205 people, we know that 80 arrived during the middle part of the concert. So, the remaining number of people who came after the first song is: 205 (remaining ticket buyers) - 80 (arrived during the middle part) = 125 people To find the fraction of the remaining ticket buyers who came after the first song, we divide the number of people who came after the first song by the total number of remaining ticket buyers: 125 (arrived after the first song) / 205 (remaining ticket buyers) = 5/8 Therefore, boxed{5/8} of the remaining ticket buyers came after the first song."},{"prompt":"Given that x is a multiple of 36000, determine the greatest common divisor of g(x) = (5x + 3)(11x + 2)(6x + 7)(3x + 8) and x.","completion":"Evaluate g(x) focusing on its constant term when considering its gcd with x.

Analysis and experiments show that if f(x) represents the students' ability to grasp and accept concepts (the larger the value of f(x), the stronger the receptivity), and x represents the time spent presenting and teaching concepts (unit: minutes), the following formula can be used: f(x) = begin{cases} 0.1x^{2}+2.6x+43 & (0 < x leq 10) 59 & (10 < x leq 16) 3x+107 & (16 < x leq 30) end{cases} (1) How many minutes after the lecture starts does students' receptivity reach its strongest?

After this transformation, the new function is y = sin(2x + frac{pi}{6}). We can see that the coefficient 2 in front of x indicates that the period of the sine wave is now halved. 2. **Horizontal Shift**: Next, the function is translated to the right by frac{pi}{3}. This means we subtract frac{pi}{3} from each x-coordinate in the function. The new function after this translation is y = sin [2(x - frac{pi}{3}) + frac{pi}{6}]. With some simplification, y = sin(2x - frac{pi}{2}). For the sine function, the axes of symmetry are vertical lines where the function assumes its maximum or minimum value. The general form of the sine function is y = A sin(omega x + phi). To find the equation of an axis of symmetry, we can set omega x + phi = frac{pi}{2} + kpi where k is an integer. Solving for x gives the equations for the axes of symmetry. For our transformed function y = sin(2x - frac{pi}{2}), we can set 2x - frac{pi}{2} = frac{pi}{2} + kpi.

A linear equation is an equation of the first degree, meaning it should not have variables with exponents greater than 1, and it should not involve variables in the denominator or under a radical. - **Option A: 2x+3y=7** This equation involves two variables, x and y, both to the first power. While it represents a linear equation in two variables, it might be misleading to say it's not a single linear equation without further context. In the context of linear algebra, this is indeed a linear equation because it can be graphed as a straight line in a two-dimensional plane. Therefore, it meets the criteria of a linear equation. - **Option B: 3x^{2}=3** This equation has the variable x raised to the second power. This makes it a quadratic equation, not a linear equation, because a linear equation cannot have variables raised to a power higher than one. Therefore, this option does not meet the requirements of a linear equation. - **Option C: 6=frac{2}{x}-1** This equation has the variable x in the denominator. Equations with variables in the denominator are not considered linear because they do not represent straight lines when graphed. This is a rational equation, not a linear equation.

Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Identify the Perfect Squares**: Since (a, b, c,) and (d) are all pairwise distinct positive perfect squares, express them as squares of integers: [ a = p_1^2, quad b = p_2^2, quad c = p_3^2, quad d = p_4^2 ] 2. **Assumption for Simplification**: Assume (a) and (c) to be powers of the same prime.

One simple way to equalize is to let: [ x = 1, quad y = 4 ] However, (b) and (d) derived from these (when minimized as perfect squares) need not be less than earlier assumption. We instead set more feasible values: [ b = 36 quad (p_2 = 6), quad d = 9 quad (p_4 = 3) ] Since, [ frac{x}{y} = left(frac{p_4}{p_2}right)^2 implies 1/4 = (3/6)^2 = (1/2)^2 ] These pairwise distinct values ensure (a, b, c,) and (d) are minimized appropriately. 5. **Verification and Final Sum**: Calculate (4^b) and (256^d) to verify the equality: [ 4^{36} = (2^2)^{36} = 2^{72}, quad 256^9 = (2^8)^9 = 2^{72} ] Both values match, so: [ a = 4, quad b = 36, quad c = 256, quad d = 9 ] 6. **Sum (a + b + c + d)**: Hence, the smallest possible value of the sum: [ a + b + c + d = 4 + 36 + 256 + 9 = 305 ] Thus, the smallest possible value of (a + b + c + d) is: [ boxed{305} ]"},{"prompt":"Consider the equation ( (x1)(x+y+2) = (y1)(x+y+2) ).

Hence, the product (x + 1)(x - 1) is odd. Furthermore, x + 1 and x - 1 must both be two consecutive integers (since their difference is 2) and must therefore be of different parities. However, since n^3 is odd, x must be odd. Hence both x + 1 and x - 1 are even, which contradicts the fact they need to be odd. 4. **Common divisor analysis** To analyze their common divisors, consider two consecutive odd numbers: x + 1 and x - 1. Their greatest common divisor (GCD) must be a divisor of their difference too: [ text{GCD}(x + 1, x - 1) = text{GCD}(x + 1, 2) = 2. ] Since they are both odd numbers, this leaves only the common factor of 1. 5. **Assign variables a^3 and b^3** We assume x + 1 = a^3 and x - 1 = b^3 for some integers a and b: [ x + 1 = a^3, quad x - 1 = b^3. ] 6. **Determine the difference between a^3 and b^3** By subtracting these two equations, we get: [ a^3 - b^3 = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = 2. ] 7. **Show a^3 - b^3 = 2 is impossible for integers** To analyze a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = 2, note that since a and b must be integers, the only integers that when cubed and subtracted give 2 must be very specific pairs: Examining small values of a and b quickly demonstrates no pairs of integers a and b such that a^3 - b^3 = 2 exist. Larger values similarly fail to satisfy this equation under the integer constraint. # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown through contradiction that n^{3} + 1 cannot be a perfect square for any odd integer n.

However, without additional information, l and m could also be parallel (if they lie in the same direction within their planes) or be skew (not intersect and not parallel). Therefore, option A cannot be universally correct. **Option B**: Given l bot alpha and l bot beta, we consider the relationship between alpha and beta. If a line is perpendicular to two planes, and these planes are not parallel, they would intersect along a line that would also be perpendicular to l. However, since l is perpendicular to both planes, it implies that alpha and beta do not intersect, meaning alpha parallel beta. Thus, option B is logically consistent and correct. **Option C**: Given m bot beta and alpha bot beta, we examine the relationship between m and alpha. The fact that m is perpendicular to beta and alpha is also perpendicular to beta does not necessarily imply a direct relationship between m and alpha. m could either lie within alpha (if their orientations allow) or be parallel to alpha (if m is oriented in a parallel direction to alpha but not within alpha). Therefore, option C is not universally correct. **Option D**: Given alpha parallel beta, and the angle between l and alpha is equal to the angle between m and beta, we consider the relationship between l and m.

After finishing all the calculations, we replace the number in each selected cell with the corresponding mean. Is it always possible, after a finite number of such operations, to make all the numbers in all the cells equal?","completion":"To determine whether every cell of a 2018 times 2019 chessboard can be made equal through a series of specified operations, we must delve into the arithmetic properties of these operations, particularly under modulo arithmetic. Let's clearly outline the involved steps and necessary reasonings. 1. **Introduction to the problem:** We consider a 2018 times 2019 chessboard where each cell contains an integer. The operation involves selecting several cells, calculating the arithmetic mean of each selected cell and its neighboring cells (cells sharing a common edge), and replacing each selected cell's value with this mean after all calculations. 2. **Modulo Arithmetic:** We will analyze the problem under modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 5. This transformation will help in simplifying the problem by reducing the number of possible cell values to 5 (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). - Each integer on the chessboard is considered modulo 5. - Calculating the mean during the operation can be represented under modular arithmetic. 3. **Invariant Properties:** Let's define two lemmas to establish whether the numbers can change through these operations: **Lemma 1:** There exists a 2 times 3 block on the chessboard that remains invariant under the operations modulo 5, and all its numbers are not equal. **Proof of Lemma 1:** Construct the 2 times 3 block as follows: [ begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 1 & 2 3 & 4 & 0 end{array} ] - This arrangement ensures each value pair in the block does not sum up to a number divisible by 5, leading to the same remainders under modulo 5. **Lemma 2:** If a chessboard Gamma of dimensions r times s (r geq 2, s geq 2) has an invariant property, then for any integers k, l, a kr times ls chessboard constructed by tiling Gamma is also invariant under the same operations. **Proof of Lemma 2:** Divide the larger composed board into k cdot l smaller r times s sub-chessboards. Each sub-board follows the invariant property. - Since each part remains invariant under the operations, the entire kr times ls board maintains the invariant property through repeated applications. 4. **Applying the Lemmas to the Given Problem:** Since 2018 = 1009 times 2 and 2019 = 673 times 3, based on Lemma 2, the provided 2018 times 2019 chessboard can be decomposed into 1009 times 673 instances of the 2 times 3 block from Lemma 1, which retains the invariant property. - By these lemma foundations, no sequence of operations can transform all cells of the chessboard to hold identical values modulo 5. 5. **Conclusion:** Given that the 2 times 3 block's values remain distinct under modulo 5, tiling the chessboard repeatedly with this block ensures that the whole 2018 times 2019 chessboard cannot be made uniform through the described operations.

If the direct path is taken from ( A to B to C ): [ BC = 8 text{ versts to } B + sqrt{ (8cos 60^circ)^2 + (8sin 60^circ )^2 } = 8 + 8 = 16 text{ versts} ] 5. For the other route, involving ( D ), we calculate ( AD ): [ text{Given } AD = DC text{ (the hypotenuse of triangles formed)} ] Use the distance formula to calculate individual direct segments and combine: 1. ( AD = AE / cos 60^circ ) [ cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2} implies AD = frac{8}{cos 60^circ} = frac{8}{1/2}= 16varing ] 2. Checking using geometric approach and angle calculation: 6.

The remaining 10 skeletons are split evenly between adult men and children, so there are 10 / 2 = 5 adult men skeletons and 5 children skeletons. Now let's calculate the number of bones for each type: Each adult woman has 20 bones, so 10 adult women have 10 * 20 = 200 bones. Each adult man has 5 more bones than an adult woman, so each man has 20 + 5 = 25 bones. Therefore, 5 adult men have 5 * 25 = 125 bones. Each child has half as many bones as an adult woman, so each child has 20 / 2 = 10 bones. Therefore, 5 children have 5 * 10 = 50 bones.

D: Arrange all the terms of sequences {a_{n}} and {b_{n}} in ascending order to form a new sequence, and the 2023rd term of this new sequence is 4025.","completion":"First, let's investigate the sequence {a_{n}} by looking at its definition: [a_n = sum_{i=1}^n a_i - sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i = (2^{n+1} - 2) - (2^n - 2) = 2^n] This holds true for n geq 2. When n = 1, we have: [a_1 = 2^2 - 2 = 2] which is consistent with the general formula a_n = 2^n. Next, for the sequence {b_{n}}, we have: [b_n = log_2(a_{2n+1}) = log_2(2^{2n+1}) = 2n + 1] Now, let's address each conclusion: A: For left{a_{b_n}right}, we substitute b_n into a_n to get c_n = a_{b_n} = 2^{2n+1}. The ratio between consecutive terms is frac{c_{n+1}}{c_n} = frac{2^{2(n+1)+1}}{2^{2n+1}} = 4, which means left{a_{b_n}right} is a geometric sequence with common ratio 4. B: For left{b_{a_n}right}, we substitute a_n into b_n to obtain d_n = b_{a_n} = 2 cdot 2^n + 1 = 2^{n+1} + 1. The difference between consecutive terms is d_{n+1} - d_n = 2^{n+2} - 2^{n+1} = 2^{n+1}, which varies with n, indicating left{b_{a_n}right} is not an arithmetic sequence. C: The set x_n contains elements between b_n and a_{n+1} inclusive. Since b_n = 2n + 1 and a_{n+1} = 2^{n+1}, the number of elements in x_n is 2^{n+1} - (2n + 1) + 1 = 2^{n+1} - 2n. D: To find the 2023rd term of the new sequence, observe that 2^{11} < 4025 < 2^{12}. The sequence {a_n} contributes 11 terms up to 2^{11}, meaning we need 2023 - 11 = 2012 terms from {b_n}.

In order to expand sales, increase profits, and reduce inventory quickly, the store decides to take appropriate price reduction measures.

Find:<br/>(1) If the store needs to make an average daily profit of 1200, how much should the price of each shirt be reduced by?<br/>(2) When the price of each shirt is reduced by how much, the store makes the maximum average daily profit?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Required Price Reduction for a 1200 Average Daily Profit Let's denote the price reduction per shirt by x dollars. The store's average daily profit, y, can then be expressed in terms of x as follows: 1. The original profit per shirt is 40, and the original average daily sales are 20 pieces. 2. If the price is reduced by x dollars, the profit per shirt becomes (40 - x) dollars. 3. Additionally, the average daily sales increase to (20 + 2x) pieces. 4. Therefore, the average daily profit y can be calculated as y = (40 - x)(20 + 2x). Expanding this expression gives us: y = 800 + 80x - 20x - 2x^2 = -2x^2 + 60x + 800. To find the required price reduction for a 1200 average daily profit, we set y = 1200 and solve for x: 1200 = -2x^2 + 60x + 800. Rearranging and solving this quadratic equation, we find that x_1 = 10 and x_2 = 20. Both x_1 and x_2 satisfy the equation, but to reduce inventory quickly, we choose x = 20. Therefore, the price of each shirt should be reduced by boxed{20 text{ dollars}}. Part 2: Finding the Price Reduction for Maximum Average Daily Profit The average daily profit y in terms of x is given by: y = -2x^2 + 60x + 800. This can be rewritten as: y = -2(x - 15)^2 + 1250. This form shows that y reaches its maximum when x = 15, at which point the maximum average daily profit is 1250 dollars. Therefore, when the price of each shirt is reduced by boxed{15 text{ dollars}}, the store achieves the maximum average daily profit of boxed{1250 text{ dollars}}."},{"prompt":"Let the universal set be U = mathbb{R}, set A = {x | 1 leq x < 4}, B = {x | 2a leq x < 3a}. 1.

Given A = {x | 1 leq x < 4}, the complement of A in the universe of real numbers, mathbb{R}, is complement_{U}A = {x | x < 1 text{ or } x geq 4} since it includes all real numbers not in A. When we set a = -2, the definition of set B becomes B = {x | 2(-2) leq x < 3 - (-2)}, which simplifies to B = {-4 leq x < 5}. - To find B cap A, we look for elements that are common to both A and B. Since A = {x | 1 leq x < 4} and B = {-4 leq x < 5}, the intersection includes numbers that are greater than or equal to 1 and less than 4. Thus, B cap A = [1, 4). - For B cap complement_{U}A, we consider elements in B that are not in A. Since complement_{U}A = {x | x < 1 text{ or } x geq 4} and B includes all numbers from -4 up to, but not including, 5, the intersection includes numbers from -4 up to but not including 1, and numbers that are equal to or greater than 4 and less than 5. Thus, B cap complement_{U}A = {x | -4 leq x < 1 text{ or } 4 leq x < 5}. 2. For A cup B = A to hold true, B must be a subset of A (B subseteq A). Considering the conditions for B and A: - If B = varnothing, there are no elements in B, which implies 2a geq 3-a. Solving for a gives 3a geq 3 or equivalently a geq 1. - If B neq varnothing, we have the following inequalities to satisfy B subseteq A: - 2a < 3-a ensures that B has an upper limit smaller than the upper limit of A. - 2a geq 1 ensures that the lower limit of B is within or greater than the lower limit of A. - 3-a leq 4 ensures the upper limit of B does not exceed the upper limit of A. Solving these inequalities: - From 2a < 3-a, we get 3a < 3 or a < 1. - From 2a geq 1, we get a geq dfrac{1}{2}. - From 3-a leq 4, we get a geq -1, but this condition is already satisfied by the other conditions. Combining these findings, we conclude that the range of a for which A cup B = A is a geq dfrac{1}{2}.
