This means the probabilities for X taking values 1, 2, 3, and 4 are frac{1}{10}, frac{2}{10}, frac{3}{10}, and frac{4}{10} respectively. 2. **Applying the Given Condition**: We are given that P(1≤X＜a)=frac{3}{5}. This means we are looking for the sum of probabilities from X=1 up to but not including X=a to equal frac{3}{5}. 3. **Calculating the Sum of Probabilities**: We calculate the sum of probabilities for X=1, 2, and 3 because we know a must be greater than 3 for the sum to reach frac{3}{5}: [ Pleft(1leqslant X lt aright) = Pleft(X=1right) + Pleft(X=2right) + Pleft(X=3right) = frac{1}{10} + frac{2}{10} + frac{3}{10} = frac{6}{10} = frac{3}{5}. ] 4. **Determining the Range of a**: Since the sum of probabilities for X=1, 2, and 3 equals frac{3}{5}, and we know P(X=4)=frac{4}{10} would exceed this sum, a must be greater than 3 but not exceed 4.

However, for the first element (i_1), it can only be (1) or (2), and for the last element (i_n), it can only be (n-1) or (n). This limits the position each number can occupy. 2. **Definition and Initialization**: - Let ( p_n ) denote the number of valid permutations of length ( n ). - For ( n = 1 ), there is only one valid permutation: ([1]). Thus, ( p_1 = 1 ). - For ( n = 2 ), the valid permutations are ([1, 2] ) and ([2, 1]).

Thus, the number of such permutations is ( p_{n-1} ). - If (i_n = n-1), then ( i_{n-1} = n ) must hold, and the remaining sequence ( left(i_1, i_2, ldots, i_{n-2}right) ) must be a valid permutation of ({1, 2, ldots, n-2} ).

Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We have ( n ) concentric circles. - Inside the disk with the smallest radius, we have two distinct points ( A ) and ( B ). - There are ( k ) distinct lines passing through ( A ) and ( m ) distinct lines passing through ( B ). - No line passes through both ( A ) and ( B ). - All lines passing through ( A ) intersect with all lines passing through ( B ). - The intersections do not lie on any of the circles. 2. **Regions Formed by Lines:** - Each pair of lines passing through ( A ) and ( B ) will intersect, forming a grid-like pattern. - The number of intersection points between ( k ) lines through ( A ) and ( m ) lines through ( B ) is ( k times m ). 3. **Regions Formed by Circles:** - Each circle divides the plane into two regions: inside and outside. - Since we are only considering the regions inside the smallest circle, each additional circle will add one more region inside the smallest circle. 4. **Combining Lines and Circles:** - The lines and circles together will form regions inside the smallest circle. - Each intersection of a line through ( A ) with a line through ( B ) will create a new region. - Each circle will further divide these regions. 5. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Regions:** - The maximum number of regions formed by ( k ) lines through ( A ) and ( m ) lines through ( B ) is given by the formula for the number of regions formed by ( k ) and ( m ) lines: [ R_{text{lines}} = (k+1)(m+1) ] - Each of the ( n ) circles will divide these regions further. The total number of regions formed by ( n ) circles and the lines is: [ R_{text{total}} = (k+1)(m+1) times n ] 6. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Regions:** - The minimum number of regions occurs when the lines and circles do not intersect in a way that maximizes the number of regions. - The minimum number of regions formed by ( k ) lines through ( A ) and ( m ) lines through ( B ) is: [ R_{text{lines}} = k + m + 1 ] - Each of the ( n ) circles will add one more region.

Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, we need to multiply the weight in pounds by 16 to get the weight in ounces. The farmer has 49 and 3/4 pounds of rice. To convert the fraction to a decimal, we divide 3 by 4, which is 0.75. So, 49 and 3/4 pounds is the same as 49.75 pounds. Now, we multiply 49.75 pounds by 16 ounces per pound to get the total weight in ounces: 49.75 pounds * 16 ounces/pound = 796 ounces Now that we have the total weight in ounces, we can divide it by the number of containers to find out how many ounces of rice will be in each container: 796 ounces / 7 containers = 113.7142857 ounces per container Since we typically don't measure rice to such a precise decimal, we can round this to the nearest whole number or a more practical decimal place for measuring.

We first need to determine equations that they satisfy based on the given conditions. - Each bag with 5 oranges and 7 apples leaves 1 orange when apples are completely packed: [ x = 5m + 1 quad text{and} quad y = 7m ] - Each bag with 9 oranges and 7 apples leaves 21 apples when oranges are completely packed: [ x = 9n quad text{and} quad y = 7n + 21 ] 2. **Equating for Consistency:** From both the conditions, ( x = 5m + 1 ) and ( x = 9n ).

Next, we draw two circles: one with center A and radius 12, and another with center B and radius 5. The points M and N are the points where these circles intersect the hypotenuse AC. 4. To find the length of the segment MN, we need to understand the geometric properties of these intersections. Since A is the center of the circle with radius 12, the points M and N are located such that AM = 12 and AN = 12 (since it is the same circle). 5. Similarly, since B is the center of the circle with radius 5, the length BN = 5. However, we'll directly use the length from A to M and then to N through the hypotenuse. 6. Since MN lies along the hypotenuse and starts from M (which is 12 units away from A) and ends at N (after passing through the point B which is 5 units away from B), we can use segment subtraction to find the length of MN. Since A to M is 12 units away along AC, and AB to B is 13 but B to N is 5: To calculate MN, note that part of this involves deducing [ MN = AM - BN ] Since we know: [ MN’ = AB - BN ] 7.

By the way, part **(a)** of this problem is the place where I used [the wellknown Dedekind theorem](http://mathlinks.ro/viewtopic.php?t=5537).</details>","completion":"# Part (1) 1. **Using Dedekind's Theorem**: Dedekind's theorem states that for any irrational number alpha, the fractional parts {alpha k} are dense in the interval [0, 1]. In this case, we consider alpha = sqrt{3}. 2. **Finding Close Approximations**: By Dedekind's theorem, there exists an integer k such that {sqrt{3}k} is arbitrarily close to 1. This means that for some k, sqrt{3}k is very close to an integer. 3. **Constructing the Triangle**: Consider the points (0, 0), (k, 0), and (frac{k}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}k). These points form an equilateral triangle with side length k. 4. **Ensuring Different Discs**: Since the radius of each disc is frac{1}{1000}, the points (0, 0), (k, 0), and (frac{k}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}k) will lie in different discs if k is sufficiently large. Thus, there exists an equilateral triangle whose vertices lie in different discs. blacksquare # Part (2) 1. **Assumption and Setup**: Without loss of generality, assume one vertex of the equilateral triangle is at the origin (0, 0), and another vertex is at (a, 0) where a is an integer. 2. **Third Vertex Calculation**: The third vertex of the equilateral triangle will be at (frac{a}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a). 3. **Distance Constraints**: The side length of the equilateral triangle must be between a - frac{1}{500} and a + frac{1}{500} due to the radius of the discs being frac{1}{1000}. 4. **Slope Consideration**: The slope between the point near the origin and the point near (a, 0) is at most -frac{1}{500a}, hence the third point coming out of the midpoint has a slope at least 500a. 5. **Bounding the Third Point**: The third point must be close to (frac{a}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a). This implies frac{a}{2} must be close to an integer, so we can write a = 2k. 6. **Integer Approximation**: We need sqrt{3}k to be close to an integer. The length of the equilateral triangle would be at least 2(k - frac{1}{500}) = 2k - frac{1}{250}. 7. **Bounding k**: For a > 96, we need k > 50. Assume k leq 50 and reach a contradiction. 8. **Continued Fractions**: The continued fraction of sqrt{3} is 1, [1, 2], and the convergents are 1, 2, frac{5}{3}, frac{7}{4}, frac{19}{11}, frac{26}{15}, frac{71}{41}, frac{97}{56}, ldots. 9. **Convergent Condition**: If left| sqrt{3} - frac{p}{q} right| < frac{1}{2q^2}, then frac{p}{q} is a convergent. This implies left| sqrt{3}k - n right| < frac{1}{1000} < frac{1}{2k}, so frac{n}{k} is a convergent with the denominator at most 50. 10. **Contradiction**: Therefore, k must be at most 41. Using another theorem, left| 41sqrt{3} - 71 right| > frac{1}{97} > frac{1}{1000}, yielding the result we want. Thus, every equilateral triangle with vertices in different discs has a side length greater than 96. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Leonard, Michael, and their sister Emily bought presents for their father's birthday.

Since ( L(x) ) and ( L(y) ) are the number of prime factors (not necessarily distinct), the smallest value for ( x ) and ( y ) with a length of 16 would be when they are powers of 2, because 2 is the smallest prime number.

Therefore, the number of boys who passed would be P% of 1,100, and the number of girls who passed would be 32% of 900. Now, let's calculate the number of candidates who passed: Number of boys who passed = (P/100) * 1,100 Number of girls who passed = (32/100) * 900 The total number of candidates who passed is the sum of the boys who passed and the girls who passed: Total passed = Number of boys who passed + Number of girls who passed Total passed = (P/100) * 1,100 + (32/100) * 900 Since 64.7% of the candidates failed, it means that 100% - 64.7% = 35.3% of the candidates passed.

First, we compare -frac{1}{3} and -2 based on the fact that a smaller negative number has a greater absolute value. We know that frac{1}{3} < 2, which implies that -frac{1}{3} > -2 because when we negate both sides, the inequality sign reverses. 2. Next, we place -frac{1}{3}, -2, and 0 in order relative to each other and sqrt{3}. Since -frac{1}{3} > -2 and both are less than 0, and knowing that sqrt{3} is a positive number greater than 0, we can arrange them as follows: -2 < -frac{1}{3} < 0 < sqrt{3} 3.

For which values of ( k ) is this possible?","completion":"Given is a (6 times 6) square that needs to be filled with 12 tiles, where (k) have the shape of an 'L', and the remaining (12 - k) are rectangles. We aim to find all possible values of (k) for which this is feasible. 1. If (k) is even, the square can be filled using both L-shaped tiles and rectangular tiles. To achieve this: - Divide the square into (2 times 3) rectangles. - Each (2 times 3) rectangle can be split into either two L-shaped tiles or two rectangular tiles. 2. For values of (k = 5, 7, 9, 11), filling is also possible. This can be visualized from the patterns shown in Figure 1 of the original problem statement. 3. Next, we analyze the cases for (k = 1) and (k = 3). **Case 1: (k = 1)** - Number the rows of the square from 1 to 6 from bottom to top. - Assign each cell of a tile a row number. - The sum of the row numbers of the cells in any rectangle is divisible by 3, while it is not for L-shaped tiles. - The sum of the row numbers of the entire (6 times 6) square is divisible by 3, hence for (k = 1), the arrangement is impossible. **Case 2: (k = 3)** - Number the rows and columns of the square as in Case 1. - Associate each figure (tile) with two numbers: the sum of the row numbers and the sum of the column numbers of the cells where each tile is located. - For rectangular tiles, both of these sums are divisible by 3; for L-shaped tiles, they are not. - The (6 times 6) square’s sums for rows and columns are divisible by 3. - Thus, the arrangement with three L-shaped tiles and nine rectangular tiles is possible if all three L-shaped tiles are of the same type. We assume all L-shaped tiles are oriented as shown in Figure 2 for simplicity. 4. Next, we demonstrate by contradiction that a strip of width 6 and height (n) can’t be arranged if L-shaped tiles are only of one type. If such an arrangement were possible, then it would imply that arranging a smaller strip of width 6 and height (m) (where (m < n)) would also be possible. We number the rows of the strip from bottom to top. - The base case shown in Figure 3 indicates that if no cells in the first three rows of the strip belong to an L-shaped tile, you can remove the first row ensuring that this observation remains throughout. 5. Consider there is an L-shaped tile containing a cell in the first or second row. - Take the rightmost L-shaped tile under this condition. - By verifying with horizontal and vertical placement of rectangular tiles, it can be shown that the configuration doesn’t exceed the strip’s boundaries (Figure 4). - This argument continues iteratively, repositioning an L-shaped tile upward if needed (Figure 5). 6. Eventually, a configuration arises that contradicts the assumption. This verifies that it’s not possible to cover the strip without going outside the boundaries if at least one L-shaped tile is used. 7. Finally, when (m < 3), it becomes evident that such a coverage isn't possible, establishing boundaries for possible (k). # Conclusion: Therefore, filling a (6 times 6) square is possible for all even values of (k) as well as (k = 5, 7, 9, 11).

Since her husband catches up to her in 15 minutes, we can calculate the distance he traveled and then use that to determine the distance Yolanda traveled. First, let's convert the 15 minutes to hours because the speeds are given in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is 15/60 = 0.25 hours. Now, let's calculate the distance Yolanda's husband traveled in that time. He drives at 40 miles per hour, so in 0.25 hours, he would have traveled: Distance = Speed × Time Distance_husband = 40 mph × 0.25 hours = 10 miles Since Yolanda's husband caught up to her in the same time it took him to travel 10 miles, this means Yolanda also traveled 10 miles by the time he caught up to her. Now, let's calculate how long it took Yolanda to travel those 10 miles at her speed of 20 miles per hour: Time = Distance / Speed Time_Yolanda = 10 miles / 20 mph = 0.5 hours So, Yolanda traveled for 0.5 hours (30 minutes) before her husband caught up to her. Since her husband left 15 minutes after she did and caught up to her in another 15 minutes, Yolanda must have left 30 minutes before her husband caught up to her.

Since 35% of her plants are flowering plants, we calculate: 35% of 120 plants = 0.35 * 120 = 42 flowering plants. Now, let's find out how many of these flowering plants produce 7 flowers and how many produce 4 flowers. Since 60% of the flowering plants produce 7 flowers, we calculate: 60% of 42 flowering plants = 0.60 * 42 = 25.2, which we round down to 25 plants that produce 7 flowers (since we can't have a fraction of a plant). The remaining 40% of the flowering plants produce 4 flowers, so we calculate: 40% of 42 flowering plants = 0.40 * 42 = 16.8, which we round down to 16 plants that produce 4 flowers. Lydia wants to place a fifth of her flowering plants on the porch. A fifth of 42 flowering plants is: 1/5 of 42 = 42 / 5 = 8.4, which we round down to 8 flowering plants (since we can't have a fraction of a plant). However, due to space constraints, she can only place 8 of the plants that produce 7 flowers and 6 of the plants that produce 4 flowers on the porch. So, we calculate the total number of flowers on the porch as follows: 8 plants * 7 flowers/plant = 56 flowers from the plants that produce 7 flowers. 6 plants * 4 flowers/plant = 24 flowers from the plants that produce 4 flowers.

Setting f'(x)=0 yields x=1 or x=1-b. ① If 1-b=1, that is b=0, then f'(x)=-(x-1)^{2}e^{-x}leq 0. In this case, the function is monotonically decreasing on (-infty,+infty). ② If 1-b > 1, or equivalently b < 0, then f'(x)=-(x-1)[x-(1-b)]e^{-x} > 0 gives us (x-1)[x-(1-b)] < 0, which implies 1 < x < 1-b.

Let h(x)=g'(x). Then h(x) must have a zero in both (0,x_{0}) and (x_{0},1). So h(x) must have at least two zeros in (0,1). We have g'(x)=e^{x}-4ax-b and h'(x)=e^{x}-4a.

The disposition of n and m does not necessarily imply alpha parallel beta; alpha and beta could intersect or be parallel.

So, the relative speed of the two trains is: 50 km/h - 40 km/h = 10 km/h To convert this speed into meters per second, we use the conversion factor 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s: 10 km/h * (5/18) = (10 * 5) / 18 = 50 / 18 = 2.777... m/s Now, let's denote the length of each train as L meters. Since the trains are of equal length, the total distance they need to cover to cross each other is 2L meters. The time taken to cross each other while running in the same direction is given as 50 seconds. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed 50 seconds = 2L / 2.777... m/s Now we can solve for L: 2L = 50 * 2.777... 2L = 138.888...

Since C is an angle of the triangle, sin C neq 0. Hence, 2cos A - 1 = 0, which gives cos A = frac{1}{2}.

The prime factorization of 72 is: 72 = 2^3 * 3^2 The prime factorization of 5824 is: 5824 = 2^6 * 7^2 The GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors.

Verifying the tiling configuration: - Check that the combination covers the whole angle without leaving any gaps: - Three pentagons cannot cover a (160^circ) angle as their smallest angle sums to more than (160^circ). 5. Configuration of Pentagon: Start by placing one pentagon such that its side aligns with a side of the 18-gon and its (100^circ) angle is along an angle of the 18-gon. Next, another pentagon is aligned such that its (80^circ) angle coincides with the next vertex of the 18-gon. Continue placing the pentagons ensuring that: - At each vertex of the 18-gon, angle combinations add up to (160^circ). - At every step, the side lengths continue to match the side length (c). - Overlapping is avoided by meticulous placing of subsequent pentagons using rotation and reflection symmetry around the 18-gon. 6.

The height from ( D ) to ( AB ) being parallel to ( BC ) implies that the height actually coincides with side ( DA ). Thus, this configuration turns ( ABCD ) into a rectangle, since the height drawn from one vertex of a parallelogram lies along one of its sides forming right angles. 3. Given ( angle ABD = angle CBD = 45^circ ), each angle at vertex ( B ) split by the diagonal ( BD ) in a rectangle are ( 45^circ ) as they sum to ( 90^circ ). 4.

However, sin 0 = 0 and sin pi = 0 are the same, and we also know that sin frac{kπ}{n} can have symmetric values due to the periodic and symmetric properties of the sine function. This could reduce the number of unique values in the set. 3. If A_n has exactly 4 unique elements, this means that aside from sin 0 = 0 and sin pi = 0, there should be exactly two unique non-zero values determined by the nature of sin frac{kπ}{n} for kin {1, 2, ..., n-1}. 4. Given the symmetry and periodicity of the sine function, and considering that we need to count unique values, the function will yield identical values when k is symmetrically placed around frac{n}{2}. For example, sin frac{π}{n} and sin frac{(n-1)π}{n} will be the same since sin theta = sin (pi - theta). 5. Since we need exactly 4 unique values in A_n, and considering the sine function's properties, we deduce that n must be such that when divided by pi, it results in distinct sine values for k=1, 2 before the values start repeating due to symmetry. This happens for n=6 and n=7, where n=6 gives sin frac{π}{6}, sin frac{2π}{6}=sin frac{π}{3} as the non-zero unique values, and n=7 introduces a different set of unique sine values due to its prime nature but still adheres to the condition of having 4 unique elements when considering 0 and repeated values through symmetry. Given this analysis, the correct answer, reflecting the possible values of n that satisfy the condition of A_n having exactly 4 distinct elements, is not provided in the given options as the conclusion reached is that the possible values of n are 6 and 7. However, staying true to the format and the options provided, the solution incorrectly identifies the possible values of n.

The speed of the jogger is 9 km/hr, and the speed of the train is 45 km/hr. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the jogger's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed: Relative speed of the train = Speed of the train - Speed of the jogger Relative speed of the train = 45 km/hr - 9 km/hr Relative speed of the train = 36 km/hr To convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s: Relative speed of the train in m/s = 36 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed of the train in m/s = 36 * 5/18 Relative speed of the train in m/s = 10 m/s Now that we have the relative speed in meters per second, we can calculate the distance the train travels while passing the jogger. The train takes 37 seconds to pass the jogger, so: Distance traveled by the train = Relative speed of the train * Time taken to pass the jogger Distance traveled by the train = 10 m/s * 37 s Distance traveled by the train = 370 m However, this distance includes the initial 240 m head start that the jogger had. To find the length of the train, we need to subtract the head start distance from the total distance traveled by the train: Length of the train = Distance traveled by the train - Head start of the jogger Length of the train = 370 m - 240 m Length of the train = 130 m Therefore, the length of the train is boxed{130} meters."},{"prompt":"Given that the four vertices of quadrilateral ABCD are A(0,0), B(2,1), C(4,2), and D(2,3), determine the shape of quadrilateral ABCD and provide a proof.","completion":"To determine the shape of quadrilateral ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(2,-1), C(4,2), and D(2,3), we calculate the vectors that represent its sides. First, we find the vectors overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{DC}: - For overrightarrow{AB}, we subtract the coordinates of A from B: overrightarrow{AB} = B - A = (2, -1) - (0, 0) = (2, -1). - For overrightarrow{DC}, we subtract the coordinates of D from C: overrightarrow{DC} = C - D = (4, 2) - (2, 3) = (2, -1). Since overrightarrow{AB} = overrightarrow{DC} = (2, -1), it implies that AB is parallel to DC and they have the same magnitude. Next, we calculate the dot product of overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{BC} to determine if they are perpendicular: - The vector overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (4, 2) - (2, -1) = (2, 3). - The dot product overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = (2) cdot (2) + (-1) cdot (3) = 4 - 3 = 1. Since this is not equal to 0, overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{BC} are not perpendicular. Furthermore, we calculate the magnitudes of overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{BC}: - |overrightarrow{AB}| = sqrt{(2)^2 + (-1)^2} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5} - |overrightarrow{BC}| = sqrt{(2)^2 + (3)^2} = sqrt{4 + 9} = sqrt{13} Since |overrightarrow{AB}| neq |overrightarrow{BC}|, they have different lengths, and because overrightarrow{AB} is parallel to overrightarrow{DC} and they have the same magnitude, but overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{BC} are not perpendicular and have different lengths, we conclude that quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram, where opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, but adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular and can have different lengths.

We are given that John has 18 blue pens, so B = 18. We are also told that John has 5 more black pens than red pens, so we can write that as K = R + 5. Since John has exactly 31 pens in total, we can write the equation: B + K + R = 31 Substituting the values we know (B = 18 and K = R + 5) into the equation, we get: 18 + (R + 5) + R = 31 Combining like terms, we get: 18 + 2R + 5 = 31 2R + 23 = 31 Subtracting 23 from both sides, we get: 2R = 31 - 23 2R = 8 Dividing both sides by 2, we get: R = 4 Now that we know R (the number of red pens), we can find K (the number of black pens): K = R + 5 K = 4 + 5 K = 9 So, John has 9 black pens.

These correspond to the slopes of the tangent lines. Since the slope of a line is given by -frac{Coefficient of x}{Coefficient of y}: - For m = frac{1}{2}, the slope is undefined (vertical line). - For m = -frac{1}{2}, the line l becomes 3x + 4y - 8 = 0, with slope -frac{3}{4}. Therefore, the slope of line l when it intersects the circle ranges from -infty to -frac{3}{4}.

Let's initially assume a configuration (Gamma) with the smallest possible number of intersections between two black chords. 2. **Contradiction on Intersections Between Black Chords** We claim that in configuration (Gamma), no two black chords intersect. Suppose, for contradiction, that two black chords ( AC ) and ( BD ) (joining even-numbered points (A, B, C,) and (D)) intersect. 3. **New Configuration by Replacing Black Chords** We then derive a new configuration (Gamma') by replacing the intersecting black chords ( AC ) and ( BD ) with ( AB ) and ( CD ). We need to show that this new configuration (Gamma') does not increase the number of black-red intersections. There are several cases to consider: - **Case 1:** Two odd points ( X ) and ( Y ) with a red chord ( XY ) lie between ( A ) and ( B ). - Here ( XY ) does not intersect any of the replaced chords ( AC, BD, AB, ) or ( CD ). - **Case 2:** ( X, Y ) lie between ( B ) and ( C ). - Similarly, ( XY ) does not intersect ( AC, BD, AB, ) or ( CD ). - **Case 3:** ( X, Y ) lie between ( C ) and ( D ). - Again, ( XY ) does not intersect ( AC, BD, AB, ) or ( CD ). - **Case 4:** ( X, Y ) lie between ( D ) and ( A ). - In this case too, ( XY ) does not intersect ( AC, BD, AB, ) or ( CD ). 4. **Intermediate Cases with Intersection Analysis** - **Case 5:** ( X ) lies between ( A ) and ( B ), and ( Y ) lies between ( B ) and ( C ). - Here ( XY ) intersects ( BD ) and ( AB ), so the number of intersections does not change. - **Case 6:** ( X ) lies between ( B ) and ( C ), and ( Y ) lies between ( A ) and ( D ). - In this case, ( XY ) intersects ( BD ) and the intersection count may decrease. 5. **No Black Chord Intersections in Minimum Configuration** Each case demonstrates that replacing ( AC ) and ( BD ) with ( AB ) and ( CD ) does not increase the number of black-red intersections. Hence, we contradict our original assumption, proving that the configuration (Gamma) with the smallest number of intersection points between black chords will actually have no such intersections. 6. **Isolating a Black Chord** Since there are fewer than ( n ) intersections between black and red chords and ( n ) black chords, there must be at least one black chord ( AB ) that does not intersect any red chord. 7. **Ensuring Intersection with Red Chords** Notice that ( A ) and ( B ) must be even points, and between them, there must be an odd number of intermediate points. One of these odd points must form a red chord that intersects ( AB ), otherwise, the setup contradicts the claimed number of intersections. # Conclusion: Given all the assertions and analysis, it can be inferred that there must be at least ( n ) intersection points where a black chord intersects a red chord.

Let ( AE ) be the external angle bisector of ( angle CAB ) intersecting the extension of ( BC ) at point ( E ). We are given that ( AD = AE ). 2. **Properties of Internal and External Angle Bisectors**: By the construction, the internal and external angle bisectors ( AD ) and ( AE ), respectively, are perpendicular to each other since ( AD ) bisects the internal angle and ( AE ) bisects the external angle such that ( angle ADE = 90^circ ). Since ( triangle ADE ) is isosceles with ( AD = AE ), we can conclude: [ angle ADE = 90^circ. ] Additionally, ( triangle ADE ) is isosceles with ( AD = AE ) hence: [ angle DAE = angle DEA. ] 3. **Angles in Triangle ( triangle ABD ) and ( triangle ADC )**: Considering ( triangle ABD ), we have: [ angle ADB = 45^circ. ] This follows because ( AD ) is an angle bisector in ( triangle ABD ), leading to ( angle BDA = 45^circ ) when ( triangle ADE ) is constructed such that it satisfies the isosceles condition. Similarly, for ( triangle ADC ), we have: [ angle ADC = 135^circ ] since it is constructed such that ( angle ADE = 90^circ ). 4. **Applying the Angle Bisector Theorem**: Since ( AD ) bisects ( angle CAB ), we establish: [ gamma + frac{alpha}{2} = 45^circ, tag{1} ] where ( gamma ) is an exterior angle opposite vertex ( C ).

When we add the two numbers (242 and 698) and their remainders (11 and 18), we should get a number that is also a multiple of D plus the remainder when the sum (940) is divided by D: (242 + 11) + (698 + 18) = 940 + 29 = 969 So, 969 is a multiple of D plus the remainder 9: 969 = D * q4 + 9 Now, we can see that 969 - 9 = 960 must be a multiple of D: 960 = D * q4 Since 960 is a multiple of D, and we know that 940 divided by D leaves a remainder of 9, D must be a divisor of the difference between 960 and 940, which is 20: 960 - 940 = 20 Therefore, D must be a factor of 20. The factors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. However, since the remainders when dividing 242 and 698 are 11 and 18 respectively, D must be greater than these remainders. The only factor of 20 that is greater than 18 is 20 itself. Thus, the divisor D is boxed{20} ."},{"prompt":"The hyperbola equation is x^{2}2y^{2}=1, then the coordinates of its foci are ______.","completion":"To solve for the coordinates of the foci of the hyperbola given by the equation x^{2}-2y^{2}=1, we follow these steps: 1. **Transform the given equation into standard form**: The equation x^{2}-2y^{2}=1 can be rewritten as x^{2}-frac{y^{2}}{frac{1}{2}}=1 by dividing the y^{2} term by frac{1}{2} to match the standard form of a hyperbola equation, which is frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}-frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1. 2. **Identify a^{2} and b^{2}**: From the transformed equation, we can see that a^{2}=1 and b^{2}=frac{1}{2}. 3. **Calculate c^{2}**: For a hyperbola, the relationship between a^{2}, b^{2}, and c^{2} is given by c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.

Step 1: Analyze the function f(x) and its properties. - The function f(x) is defined for all real numbers, as the argument of the logarithm is always positive. - By examining f(x) and f(-x), we find: [ f(-x) = log(sqrt{1+x^2}-x) ] Adding f(x) and f(-x) gives: [ f(x) + f(-x) = log(sqrt{1+x^2}+x) + log(sqrt{1+x^2}-x) ] Using the property of logarithms that log a + log b = log(ab), we get: [ f(x) + f(-x) = log((sqrt{1+x^2}+x)(sqrt{1+x^2}-x)) ] Simplifying the expression inside the logarithm: [ f(x) + f(-x) = log((1+x^2)-x^2) = log(1) = 0 ] This shows that f(x) is symmetric about the point (0,0). Step 2: Apply the given condition fleft(2a-2right)+fleft(bright)=0. - Since f(x) is symmetric about (0,0) and strictly increasing on mathbb{R}, we can conclude that 2a-2 and b are such that 2a-2 = -b. - Solving for 2a+b=2, we find that this must hold true for the given condition to be satisfied. Step 3: Find the minimum value of frac{{2a+b}}{{ab}}. - We express frac{{2a+b}}{{ab}} in terms of a and b: [ frac{{2a+b}}{{ab}} = frac{2}{b} + frac{1}{a} ] Substituting 2a+b=2 into the expression, we get: [ frac{2}{b} + frac{1}{a} = frac{2a+b}{ab} = frac{2}{ab} + 2 ] By AM-GM inequality, we know that frac{2}{ab} geqslant 2sqrt{frac{2}{ab}cdotfrac{2}{ab}} = 4sqrt{frac{1}{a^2b^2}}, which simplifies to frac{2}{ab} geqslant 4. - Adding 2 to both sides, we get frac{2}{ab} + 2 geqslant 6. - However, since we are looking for the minimum value of frac{{2a+b}}{{ab}}, we consider the equality condition of AM-GM, which is frac{2}{ab} = 4. - This implies 2a = b and, given 2a+b=2, we find that a=frac{1}{2} and b=1.

We start by rewriting the equation: [ frac{2x-m}{x-3}-1=frac{x}{3-x} ] Since frac{x}{3-x} can be rewritten as frac{x}{-(x-3)} (noting that 3-x=-(x-3)), we have: [ frac{2x-m}{x-3}-1=-frac{x}{x-3} ] Multiplying every term by (x-3) to eliminate the denominators, we get: [ 2x-m-(x-3)=-x ] Simplifying further: [ 2x-m-x+3=-x ] 2. Solving for x, we combine like terms: [ x=m-3 ] Therefore, we have: [ x=frac{m-3}{2} ] 3. For x to be positive, we set frac{m-3}{2} > 0. Solving this inequality: [ m-3 > 0 ] [ m > 3 ] 4.

The prime factorization of 5 is just 5 (since it is a prime number), and the prime factorization of 8 is 2^3 (since 8 = 2 x 2 x 2).

By the property of angles subtended by the same arc in a circle, we have (angle EDA = angle EH_AA = 90^circ - angle CH_AE). 2. **Calculating the angle ( angle CH_AE ):** Since ( AH_A perp BC ), we know: [ angle CH_AE = 90^circ - angle ACB ] Therefore: [ angle EDA = angle ACB ] 3. **Other Angles in (triangle ADE):** Similarly, we find: [ angle AED = angle CBA ] Considering that the third angle in both ( triangle ADE ) and ( triangle ABC ) must be the same due to the sum of angles in a triangle, we have: [ angle DAE = angle BAC ] Therefore, (triangle ADE) and (triangle ABC) are inversely similar. 4. **Showing Similarity of (triangle A H_C H_B) and (triangle ABC):** Let ( H ) be the orthocenter of (triangle ABC), which is the point of intersection of all three altitudes. Consider a parallel to ( BC ) through ( H ), cutting ( AB ) at ( B' ) and ( AC ) at ( C'). By Thales' theorem, the triangles ( ABC ) and ( AB'C' ) are directly similar. Since ( H ) serves the same role in (triangle AB'C') as ( D ) in (triangle ABC) (with ( H_B ) and ( H_C ) playing the roles of points ( E ) and ( D ) respectively in the similar configuration), (triangle AH_CHB) is inversely similar to (triangle AB'C'). From the previous part of the proof, since (triangle AB'C') is similar to (triangle ABC), (triangle AH_CHB) is inversely similar to (triangle ABC). 5. **Conclusion from Similar Triangles:** With these similar triangles established, the converse of Thales' Theorem implies that if two corresponding angles are equal, then their opposite sides are parallel. Therefore: [ (DE) parallel (H_B H_C) ] Thus, we have successfully shown the desired parallelism: [ boxed{(DE) parallel (H_B H_C)} ]"},{"prompt":"There are 2160 cards in a box.

Therefore, Winnie can visit Eeyore under certain constraints and arrangements. 5. **Determine All Feasible Days for Visiting Eeyore:** - Each visit to Eeyore imposes the condition that on at least one side (preceding or following the visit), two consecutive visits to Piglet are needed within three-day blocks to include a visit to Rabbit. 6. **Maximizing Visits to Eeyore:** - Following this logic and ensuring all conditions are met, Winnie can visit Eeyore no more frequently than once within any three consecutive days while ensuring Rabbit is visited. So we can assume the maximum number of visits should involve the least disruption: - Start with Eeyore visits on the edges, add Piglet on immediate days following: [ I1, P2, K3, P4, K5, ... , Pn-1, Kn-1, In ] This ensures Piglet is visited every two days and Rabbit within three days. Based on these rules, observe that splitting up different days between two sets without forming 'ei-ei' contradiction, essentially limiting Eeyore's maximum number to minimal consequence: Combining valid visits: **Possible sequence with Eeyore included up to two limits**: [ Eeyore rightarrow P-K-P-K-Eeyore ] - Each block extends coverage within: [ Eeyore: 1st, Last or another ensuring K within days for coverage] Thus possible repeated twice maximum feasible.

Let's suppose that a convex N-gon is divided into several smaller convex polygons, specifically heptagons (7-sided polygons), in such a way that no four consecutive vertices of the N-gon belong to the same heptagon. 2. Each heptagon has 7 vertices and, as it is convex, each internal angle is less than 180^circ. The sum of the internal angles of a heptagon is given by: [ (7-2) times 180^circ = 900^circ ] Therefore, the average internal angle of a heptagon is: [ frac{900^circ}{7} approx 128.57^circ ] 3. Let's consider the division of the N-gon: - If no four consecutive vertices of the N-gon belong to the same heptagon, this implies that at least every second vertex is intersected by one of the division lines. - As a result, each pair of consecutive angles at the vertices of the N-gon must be associated with at least three angles of the smaller heptagons. 4. Using the above properties, we can conclude that for every two consecutive vertices of the N-gon to be properly divided, there would be multiple intersections causing the angles at the vertices to be significant. Specifically, the angles adjacent to any vertex of the N-gon are on average less than: [ 120^circ ] When examining a single heptagon, its average angle is approximately 128.57^circ, and no three angles at the vertices of different heptagons add up to exceed this value significantly without causing the polygon to lose its convex nature. 5. Therefore, with no four consecutive vertices being shared by the same heptagon, it becomes impractical geometrically to maintain the division into heptagons without involving higher degree segments of angles that spread beyond the calculated average. This provides a contradiction as it tilts the angle averages and sums wrongly when trying to respect the properties of the N-gon and the heptagon logic. # Conclusion: Hence, a set of four consecutive vertices of the N-gon must belong to a single heptagon under the subdivision rules considering the average angle calculations and convex properties. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The quotient of two positive integers is frac{7}{3} and their product is 189.

This creates two concentric circles: - An inner circle, and - An outer circle Each circle will then contain 45 people. 3. **Analysis of Neighbors**: In this setup: - Each person in the inner circle has as neighbors people from the outer circle. - Conversely, each person in the outer circle has as neighbors people from the inner circle. 4. **Configuration and Constraints**: To maximize the number of people standing, we need to ensure as many people as possible have both neighbors with the same title. However: - In each circle of 45 people, due to the symmetric nature and the three different types of titles, it is inevitable that there will be at least two pairs of neighbors of different titles. The critical observation here is that no circle can be composed entirely of individuals with the same title since we have three different titles and they are distributed unevenly. 5. **Calculating the Pairs**: Given the constraints: - There must be at least two pairs of differing titles in each circle. - Therefore, in total, there must be at least four such differing pairs across both circles. 6. **Conclusion**: Since 4 people (corresponding to 2 pairs in each circle) cannot stand up, the maximum number of people who can stand up is calculated as follows: [ 90 - 4 = 86 ] Thus, the maximum number of people who can stand up following the given conditions is: [ boxed{86} ]"},{"prompt":"Let Q be the plane passing through the origin with normal vector begin{pmatrix} 2 1 2 end{pmatrix}.

Here we have two cases: - If the last digit is 0, then the remaining three digits (chosen from the other five) are unrestricted and can be arranged in A^3_5 possible ways, which yields: A^3_5 = 5 times 4 times 3 = 60 - If the last digit is not 0, we must choose between 2 and 4 for the last digit (C^1_2 = 2 ways), choose a non-zero digit from the remaining four for the first place (4 ways), and finally permute the remaining two digits in the second and third places, which can be done in 4 times 3 = 12 ways.

The symmetry in the values of q(x) around certain points, such as q(7)=q(8) and q(6)=q(9), indicates the presence of an axis of symmetry for the graph. This axis of symmetry is exactly halfway between each pair of points with equal q(x) values. Therefore, we can determine the axis of symmetry as follows: - The axis of symmetry is halfway between x=7 and x=8, which gives us x=frac{7+8}{2} = 7.5. Knowing the axis of symmetry allows us to understand that the function q(x) will yield the same value for points equidistant from x=7.5 on either side. This means: - For any value x_1 and x_2 such that x_1 and x_2 are equidistant from x=7.5, q(x_1) = q(x_2). Given that 15 is 7.5 units away from 7.5 on the right, we look for a point 7.5 units away from 7.5 on the left, which is 0 (7.5 - 7.5 = 0). Therefore, by the symmetry of the quadratic function: - q(15) = q(0). The graph passes through the point (0, -3), indicating that q(0) = -3.

Consider (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{2n+1} geq -a) such that (sum_{j=1}^{2n+1} x_j^3 = a^3).

Each term in the product can be written as: [ 1 - k^{-2} = 1 - frac{1}{k^2} ] for (k = 2, 3, ldots, n). 2. Thus, the product becomes: [ left(1 - frac{1}{2^2}right) left(1 - frac{1}{3^2}right) cdots left(1 - frac{1}{n^2}right) ] 3. Simplify each term: [ 1 - frac{1}{k^2} = frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2} ] 4. Therefore, the product can be rewritten as: [ prod_{k=2}^{n} left(1 - frac{1}{k^2}right) = prod_{k=2}^{n} frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2} ] 5. Factor each (k^2 - 1) as a difference of squares: [ k^2 - 1 = (k - 1)(k + 1) ] which gives: [ frac{k^2 - 1}{k^2} = frac{(k - 1)(k + 1)}{k^2} ] 6.

Notice that this can be separated into two products: [ prod_{k=2}^{n} frac{k-1}{k} times prod_{k=2}^{n} frac{k+1}{k} ] 8. Each of these products is a telescoping series.

Each ant can choose to move to one of the 3 neighboring vertices. Therefore, each ant's movement can be described as a number from 1 to 4, excluding its current vertex. 2. **Total Number of Movements:** Since each ant has 3 choices of vertices to move to, the total number of possible movement combinations for all four ants is calculated as: [ 3^4 = 81 ] This represents all possible 4-tuples where each element of the tuple represents the destination vertex of an ant. 3. **Count Configurations with No Collisions:** We need to count how many of these configurations result in no two ants meeting. This will occur if all ants move to different vertices (ensuring no meetings at vertices) and no two ants move towards each other on the same edge. 4. **Construct Valid Permutations:** Consider 4-tuples where no ant moves towards another.

Knowing there exists a nonzero T such that f(x+T) = Tf(x) for any x in mathbb{R}, we set T = 2 and get: f(x+4) = f((x+2)+2) = 2f(x+2) = 4f(x), which implies: f(x) = frac{1}{4}(x + 4 + ln(x + 4)). Therefore, the expression for f(x) when -3 < x < -2 is f(x) = frac{1}{4}(x + 4 + ln(x + 4)). 3. When k = 0, f(x) = sin(kx) = 0 clearly belongs to M. For k neq 0, since f(x) = sin(kx) in M, there exists a nonzero constant T such that f(x+T) = Tf(x) for any x in mathbb{R}; that is, sin(kx + kT) = Tsin(kx). As k neq 0 and x is any real number, kx and kx + kT are also real, meaning sin(kx) and sin(kx + kT) must both lie within [-1, 1].

Let ( u = 2x-1 ), then ( du = 2dx ) or ( dx = frac{du}{2} ). The limits of integration change accordingly: when ( x = 1 ), ( u = 1 ); and when ( x = n ), ( u = 2n-1 ). Thus, the integral becomes: [ int_1^n frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}} = int_1^{2n-1} frac{du}{2sqrt{u}} = frac{1}{2} int_1^{2n-1} u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du ] 3. **Evaluate the integral:** The integral ( int u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du ) is straightforward: [ int u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du = 2u^{frac{1}{2}} = 2sqrt{u} ] Applying the limits of integration, we get: [ frac{1}{2} left[ 2sqrt{u} right]_1^{2n-1} = left[ sqrt{u} right]_1^{2n-1} = sqrt{2n-1} - sqrt{1} = sqrt{2n-1} - 1 ] 4. **Refine the approximation:** The initial approximation can be refined by considering the excess on the interval ([0,1]).

Clearly, the claim holds since there are two equal sets. Therefore, the statement is true for (n=1). 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement is true for a given (n); that is, for (n) sets (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n+1}), there exist two disjoint non-empty subsets (left{i_{1}, cdots, i_{k}right}) and (left{j_{1}, cdots, j_{m}right}) of (left{1,2, ldots, nright}) such that: [ B_{i_{1}} cup cdots cup B_{i_{k}} = B_{j_{1}} cup cdots cup B_{j_{m}}, ] where (B_{i} = A_{i} setminus {n+1}).

Then, (B_{1}, B_{2}, cdots, B_{n+1}) are non-empty subsets of ({1, 2, ldots, n}). By the induction hypothesis, there exist two disjoint sets within ({1, 2, ldots, n+1}). Similarly, (B_{2}, B_{3}, cdots, B_{n+2}) are non-empty subsets of ({1, 2, ldots, n}). By applying the inductive hypothesis again, there exist two disjoint subsets within ({2, 3, ldots, n+2}).

Let the base of the pyramid be a regular n-sided polygon, denoted by A_1 A_2 ldots A_n. 2. Since the base is a regular polygon, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal. 3. Let S be the apex of the pyramid. The triangular faces of the pyramid are Delta SA_1A_2, Delta SA_2A_3, ldots, Delta SA_nA_1. 4. Since the given condition states that all planar angles at the apex S are equal, this implies that each lateral face angle, say angle SA_1A_2 = angle SA_2A_3 = cdots = angle SA_nA_1. This is an equal angle condition formed by any two sides at apex S with respect to the base edges. 5. According to the properties of regular polygons and symmetry with equal planar angles, this implies that each pair of adjacent faces must have equal share of total angles formed around the apex S. 6. In a regular polygon, each vertex of the polygon makes equal internal angles with the center of the polygonal base when divided radially. For triangular facets around the apex S, the corresponding base edges (forming lateral edges) are equally inclined. 7. Since the polygon is regular, and based on geometric symmetry of equal inclined planar angles forming apex with base edges, each triangular facet SA_iA_{i+1} must be identical in the planar angles to adjacent triangular facet SA_{i+1}A_{i+2}. Thus, multiple reflections in a regular polygon base result in at least pairs of identical triangular facets due to equal contributing angle measures. Conclusively, due to the repetitive planar angle condition around apex S, and equal planar angle distribution over a base regular polygon's all edges, there exist at least two congruent triangular faces Delta SA_iA_{i+1} equiv Delta SA_{j}A_{j+1} associating identical planar angles and equal sides.

Therefore, f'(1) = 1. The equation of the tangent line to f(x) at the point (1, f(1)) is y - 5 = x - 1, which simplifies to y = x + 4. Let's assume that the line y = x + 4 is tangent to g(x) = frac{kx}{x+1} at the point P(x_0, y_0). Therefore, we must have g'(x_0) = 1 and g(x_0) = x_0 + 4.

In the initial table, there were ones on the diagonal and zeros in the rest. Is it possible to make all numbers in the table equal using several allowed transformations? (It's assumed that the rook visited all the cells of the table through which its path passes.)","completion":"To determine whether we can make all numbers in an ( n times n ) grid equal under the given operations, let's analyze the problem step by step. 1. **Chessboard Coloring and Invariance**: We color the ( n times n ) table in a checkerboard pattern (like a chessboard). Each cell is designated either black or white in an alternating pattern. 2. **Movement Analysis**: Any closed rook path (a path where the rook returns to its starting point) will contain an equal number of black and white cells due to the alternating nature of the chessboard pattern. 3. **Invariant Definition**: The invariant in this scenario is the difference between the sum of numbers in black cells and the sum of numbers in white cells. We denote this difference as [ I = text{(Sum of numbers in black cells)} - text{(Sum of numbers in white cells)} ] 4. **Initial Invariant**: Initially, the table has 1's along the diagonal and 0's elsewhere. Calculating the initial invariant: - In a ( n times n ) grid, there are ( n ) cells on the diagonal. - Half of these cells (when ( n ) is even) will be black and the other half white. When ( n ) is odd, one more cell will be of one color than the other. Therefore: - For even ( n ): [ I = left(frac{n}{2} times 1right) - left(frac{n}{2} times 1right) = 0 ] - For odd ( n ): [ I = left(leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1right) - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor = 1 ] 5. **Implications of the Invariant**: The invariant ( I ) does not change through the allowed operations because each move consists of adding 1 to equal numbers of black and white cells, thus preserving the difference. 6. **Conclusion for Even ( n )**: For even ( n ), the initial invariant ( I = 0 ). This invariant will always be preserved. Therefore, it is impossible to make all the numbers in the table equal because they would then imply an invariant of zero, violating the initial condition set by the pattern. 7. **Conclusion for Odd ( n )**: For odd ( n ), the grid can be transformed such that all numbers become the same. This can be shown using mathematical induction: **Base Case**: - When ( n = 1 ), the table already has all entries equal (one individual cell). **Induction Step**: - Assume for an ( (n-2) times (n-2) ) table (which can equalize values), consider the ( n times n ) table. - Break the table into a central ( (n-2) times (n-2) ) sub-grid and a surrounding 1-cell-wide frame. - By the inductive hypothesis, transform the central ( (n-2) times (n-2) ) sub-grid such that all numbers are equal without affecting the surrounding frame. - Add 1 repeatedly to elements in the central squares and appropriate sections until all elements balance out. Continuing this induction assures us that it is possible to make all numbers in the table equal for odd ( n ). # Conclusion: For even ( n ) making all numbers in the table equal is impossible due to the preserved invariant which starts and remains at zero. For odd ( n ), it is achievable through induction and systematic transformations.

This means that (1/2)E - 100 geese did not survive the first year. We are also told that E = 500. So, the number of geese that survived the first month is (1/2)(500) = 250. Therefore, the number of geese that did not survive the first year is 250 - 100 = 150.

To prove that among all the chosen numbers there are two whose sum equals 65, assume the contrary: that no two chosen numbers sum to 65. 5.

If Mario paid 18 for his last haircut and shave on Monday, accounting for all discounts, how much would he have paid the day before for a haircut, styling, and using his loyalty card on Sunday?","completion":"Let's first calculate the original price of a haircut before any discounts or additional charges. Since Mario paid 18 for a haircut and shave on Monday, and we know there is a 10% discount on weekdays and an additional 5% discount for the loyalty card, we need to work backwards to find the original price. Let's denote the original price of a haircut as ( P ). The shave costs an extra 10, so the price for just the haircut on Monday after discounts is ( 18 - 10 = 8 ). The discounts on Monday are 10% and an additional 5% for the loyalty card. To combine these, we can multiply them as follows: ( 1 - (0.10 + 0.05) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 ) So, the price after discounts is 85% of the original price, which means: ( 0.85P = 8 ) Now, we solve for ( P ): ( P = frac{8}{0.85} ) ( P = frac{800}{85} ) ( P = frac{160}{17} ) ( P approx 9.41 ) So, the original price of a haircut is approximately 9.41. Now, let's calculate the price for a haircut, styling, and using the loyalty card on Sunday. The original price is 9.41, and on weekends, haircuts are 50% more expensive, so we multiply by 1.50: ( 9.41 times 1.50 = 14.115 ) Now, add the cost of styling, which is an extra 15: ( 14.115 + 15 = 29.115 ) Now, apply the 10% loyalty card discount for Sunday: ( 29.115 times (1 - 0.10) = 29.115 times 0.90 ) ( 29.115 times 0.90 approx 26.2035 ) So, Mario would have paid approximately boxed{26.20} for a haircut, styling, and using his loyalty card on Sunday."},{"prompt":"Find all real polynomials ( p(x) ) such that ( x ) is rational if and only if ( p(x) ) is rational.","completion":"1. **Initial Observation**: We need to find all polynomials ( p(x) ) such that ( x ) is rational if and only if ( p(x) ) is rational. 2. **Necessary Condition**: We begin by considering the case where all coefficients of the polynomial are rational. Let ( p(x) ) be a polynomial with rational coefficients. Formally, we can write: [ p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0 ] where ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n ) are all rational. 3. **Inductive Argument**: First, consider ( p(0) = a_0 ), which must be rational. Next, assume that ( frac{p(x) - p(0)}{x} ) is rational for all rational ( x ). Notice: [ frac{p(x) - p(0)}{x} = a_n x^{n-1} + a_{n-1} x^{n-2} + cdots + a_1 ] For this to be rational for all rational ( x ), it must be that all coefficients of ( p(x) ) are rational. Hence, polynomials with rational coefficients satisfy the condition that ( x ) is rational if ( p(x) ) is rational. 4. **Sufficiency for Low-Degree Polynomials**: Clearly, for polynomials of degree 0 or 1, having rational coefficients suffices, and these are the only solutions for such degrees: - Degree 0: ( p(x) = c ) where ( c ) is rational. - Degree 1: ( p(x) = ax + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are rational. 5. **Non-Existence of Higher-Degree Polynomials**: We now show there are no polynomial solutions of degree 2 or higher. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that ( p(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n > 1 ). 6. **Polynomial Form and Rational Transformation**: Multiply through by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the coefficients, converting ( p(x) ) to: [ p(x) = frac{a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 x + a_0}{w} ] where ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n, w ) are integers. We express ( x ) as ( r/s ) where ( r ) and ( s ) are coprime (greatest common divisor, gcd, is 1): [ pleft(frac{r}{s}right) = frac{a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} s + cdots + a_1 r s^{n-1} + a_0 s^n}{w s^n} ] 7. **Prime-Based Argument to Derive a Contradiction**: Select a prime ( q ) that does not divide ( a_n ) or ( w ). Assume ( a_n > 0 ) (similar arguments work for ( a_n < 0 )). Consider sufficiently large integers ( m ) and let: [ k = m + frac{1}{q} ] Write ( k = frac{mq + 1}{q} ). By construction, the denominator is ( q ) (not divisible by ( q^2 )), and the numerator is not divisible by ( q ). 8. **Analyzing ( p(r/s) = k )**: Suppose ( p(r/s) = k ). Then the denominator of ( p(r/s) ): [ w s^n ] forces ( q ) to divide ( s ), implying ( s = q t ) for some integer ( t ). However, ( n > 1 ), so: [ q^2 mid w s^n ] since neither ( a_n ) nor ( r ) is divisible by ( q ), the numerator ( a_n r^n + text{...} ) remains non-divisible by ( q ), leading to a contradiction. 9. **Contradiction Conclusion**: Thus, ( p(x) ) cannot be a polynomial of degree greater than 1 and still meet the condition. Hence, Polynomials strictly of degree 0 or 1 with rational coefficients satisfy our conditions. # Conclusion: The only real polynomials ( p(x) ) that satisfy the given condition (that ( x ) is rational if and only if ( p(x) ) is rational) are those of degree 0 or 1 with all rational coefficients: [ boxed{p(x) = ax + b, text{ where } a text{ and } b text{ are rational}} ]"},{"prompt":"To calculate 51^2, Emily mentally computes the value of 50^2 and adds 101.

In the third quadrant, both costheta and sintheta are negative, hence tantheta = frac{sintheta}{costheta} is positive because the division of two negative numbers is positive. In the fourth quadrant, costheta is positive and sintheta is negative, hence tantheta = frac{sintheta}{costheta} is negative. Thus, in both cases, costheta and tantheta have different signs, so their product must be negative: costheta cdot tantheta < 0 (Leftarrow) Assume costheta cdot tantheta < 0. Here, the product of costheta and tantheta is less than zero, which means they must have opposite signs. Since tantheta is the ratio of sintheta and costheta, and costheta cannot be zero because tantheta would be undefined, we have two possible cases: 1. costheta < 0 and sintheta > 0 (which makes tantheta > 0), indicating angle theta is in the third quadrant. 2. costheta > 0 and sintheta < 0 (which makes tantheta < 0), indicating angle theta is in the fourth quadrant.

If x < 0, then -x > 0. Given that f(x)=2^{x}-3 when x > 0, we have f(-x)=2^{-x}-3 when -x > 0. 2. Since f(x) is an odd function, we know that f(-x)=-f(x).

Let's denote the number of Type A lamps as x and the number of Type B lamps as y. We are given two conditions: - The total number of lamps is 50, which gives us the equation x + y = 50. - The total purchase cost is 2500 yuan, with Type A lamps costing 40 yuan each and Type B lamps costing 65 yuan each, leading to the equation 40x + 65y = 2500. 2. Solving the system of equations: - From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x: y = 50 - x. - Substituting y = 50 - x into the second equation gives us 40x + 65(50 - x) = 2500. - Simplifying the equation: 40x + 3250 - 65x = 2500. - Combining like terms: -25x = -750. - Solving for x: x = 30. - Substituting x = 30 back into y = 50 - x gives us y = 20.

Because ( a_{ii} > 0 ) and ( a_{ij} < 0 ) for ( i neq j ), the points ( P, Q, R ) each lie in distinct octants of the space. 3. We need to show that there exists a point within the triangle ( PQR ) whose coordinates are all strictly positive, all strictly negative, or all zero. To do this, project the points ( P, Q, R ) onto the (xy)-plane, denoting their projections as ( P', Q', R' ) respectively. 4. There are two cases to consider: - **Case 1:** The origin ( O = (0, 0, 0) ) is inside the triangle ( P'Q'R' ). - **Case 2:** The origin ( O ) is outside the triangle ( P'Q'R' ). 5. **Case 1:** If the origin ( O ) lies inside ( P'Q'R' ), we lift ( O ) to some point ( S ) on the plane of ( PQR ). - If ( S ) coincides with ( O ), the coordinates of ( S ) are zero and we are done. - If the third coordinate of ( S ) (denoted ( z(S) )) is negative, we move ( S ) within ( PQR ) towards where ( x ) and ( y ) are also negative, resulting in all coordinates of a point close to ( S ) being negative. - If ( z(S) ) is positive, we move ( S ) similarly, resulting in all coordinates of a point close to ( S ) being positive. 6. **Case 2:** If the origin ( O ) is outside ( P'Q'R' ), the line segment from ( O ) to some projection (say the intersection of a line extending from ( R' ) crossing the edge ( P'Q' )) intersects inside ( P'Q'R' ) at a point ( T' ) in the quadrant where ( x < 0 ) and ( y < 0 ). - Lifting ( T' ) to a point ( T ) on ( PQR ) now gives a point ( T ) with coordinates where the third coordinate ( z(T) ) will also be either strictly negative. - Any point on the segment ( [R, T] ) close to ( T ) will have all negative coordinates as required. 7.

Let's also denote the radius of the circumcircle of △ABC as r, and its center as H. Since △ABC is an equilateral triangle, we can calculate r by using the circumcircle radius formula for an equilateral triangle: r = frac{AB}{2 cos 30^circ} = frac{6}{2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = 2sqrt{3}. Given that the surface area of the sphere is 64π, we can write: 64pi = 4pi R^2. Solving this for R gives us: R = 4. Now, O lies directly above the center of the equilateral triangle H because PA is perpendicular to the plane ABC, making OH the radius r of the circumcircle. We can find PA by calculating the distance from O to the vertices of the base (OH), which is the same as finding the height of the tetrahedron. The triangle OHA is a right triangle, where PA is the hypotenuse, and so we can apply the Pythagorean theorem: PA = 2 sqrt{R^2 - r^2} = 2 sqrt{4^2 - (2sqrt{3})^2} = 2 sqrt{16 - 12} = 2 cdot 2 = 4.

Step 2: Assume ( P(x) ) is not constant - If ( P(x) ) is constant, then the solution is trivial, and we see that the constant polynomial indeed satisfies the required conditions. - So, assume ( P(x) ) is not constant. Step 3: Analyze the 2-adic valuation - Let ( nu_p(x) ) denote the largest power of ( p ) dividing ( x ). - Claim: There exists an ( N ) such that for ( n > N ), we have ( nu_2(P(2^n)) = nu_2(P(0)) ). Proof of the Claim: - Since ( P(x) ) is non-constant, there exists an ( M ) such that ( P(x) neq P(0) ) for ( x > M ). - Let ( N = max { M, nu_2(P(0)) } ). - For ( n > N ), we have ( 2^n mid P(2^n) - P(0) ). - Since ( n > nu_2(P(0)) ) and ( P(2^n) neq P(0) ), we get ( nu_2(P(2^n)) = nu_2(P(0)) ).

Next, analyze the statement \\"Exactly one of my neighbors is a liar\\": - If a knight says this, one neighbor is a knight and the other is a liar. - If a liar says this, one of their neighbors is a knight, and since they cannot have exactly one liar neighbor, this statement must be a lie, indicating both neighbors are knights or both are liars. 5. Denote by ( k ) the number of pairs of neighboring knights. Hence, for each pair of knights, they must say that exactly one of their neighbors is a liar. Therefore, if ( k ) pairs of knights exist, this statement must hold true for ( k ) pairs. 6. Not more than ( 50 ) people say, \\"Exactly one of my neighbors is a liar,\\" because half of the 100 participants say this. Thus, the number of such pairs must satisfy [ k leq frac{50}{2} = 25. ] 7. Now, for every such pair, there are ( k ) knights and ( k ) liars involved. All knights making this statement form a sequence of knights and liars that prevents three knights from sitting consecutively. 8. Consider the remaining ( 100 - 3k ) participants. They cannot be more knights seating consecutively next to the ones in these pairs due to the configuration. 9. Hence, each remaining knight must be adjacent to exactly one liar, which enforces all remaining not adjacent formations without creating consecutive knights. 10. Combining (frac{1}{2}(100 - 3k)) knights where no three knights are consecutively around the table, we conclude: [ 50 + frac{k}{2} leq 50 + frac{25}{2} = 62.5 ] rounding this down, the integer max value is 67.

Consider (n+1) red and blue points. - Remove one chord (R_1 rightarrow B_1), which cuts out an arc containing no blue points. - If the chord was \\"stable\\", there is no change in the running tally. - If the chord was \\"inverted\\", then the tally (x < 0) and upon removing this arc, (x) changes to (x + 1). 7. **Conclusion:** - By induction, the number of inverted chords is consistently (-x), and hence, the number of arcs that cover ((1,0)) remains unchanged regardless of the ordering of (R_1, ldots, R_n).

Since she drove at a speed of 44 mph, and she spent 1.5 hours driving in total (both ways), the total distance she drove is: Total distance = Speed × Total driving time Total distance = 44 mph × 1.5 hours Total distance = 66 miles Since the total distance is 66 miles and the distance to her friend's house is 30 miles, the distance for the detour on the way back is: Distance of detour = Total distance - Distance to friend's house Distance of detour = 66 miles - 30 miles Distance of detour = 36 miles Now, let's calculate the percentage increase in distance for the detour compared to the original route: Percentage increase = [(Distance of detour - Original distance) / Original distance] × 100% Percentage increase = [(36 miles - 30 miles) / 30 miles] × 100% Percentage increase = [6 miles / 30 miles] × 100% Percentage increase = 0.2 × 100% Percentage increase = 20% The percentage increase in distance for the detour compared to the original route is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"the biotechnology class of 2000, there were 73 graduates.

Graduates who did neither (neither found a job nor continued to a second degree) = 9 We want to find the number of graduates who found a job (J).

The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. In this case, the union of the two sets (those who found a job and those who continued to their second degree) is the total number of graduates minus those who did neither. The intersection of the two sets is the number of graduates who did both.

Join these midpoints to form quadrilateral MNPQ. According to the Midpoint Theorem, the quadrilateral formed by connecting the midpoints of a quadrilateral is a parallelogram. 2. **Properties of the parallelogram**: Since MNPQ is a parallelogram, the line segments connecting the midpoints of opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD, which are MP and NQ, are the diagonals of the parallelogram MNPQ. These diagonals bisect each other at point R (the intersection point). 3. **Midpoints of diagonals of the initial quadrilateral**: Next, consider the diagonals AC and BD of the original quadrilateral ABCD, and let their midpoints be denoted by E and F respectively. 4. **Join midpoints of the diagonals**: The line segment EF connects the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD. By the properties of parallelograms, it is known that this line segment EF passes through point R (the previously identified point where diagonals of parallelogram MNPQ intersect) and EF is also bisected by R. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, in any quadrilateral ABCD, the line segments connecting the midpoints of opposite sides (MP and NQ) and the line segment connecting the midpoints of the diagonals (EF) all intersect at one point and are bisected by this intersection point.

Assume (b) and (c) are relatively prime, meaning (text{gcd}(b, c) = 1). 3. **Stepwise Transformations:** Since (text{gcd}(b, c) = 1), we can find integers (x) and (y) such that: [ a + xb + yc = 1 ] This is a direct consequence of the fact that integers (b) and (c) form a linear combination to produce 1. Therefore, we can: - First, modify (a) to (a + xb). - Next, modify (a + xb) to (a + xb + yc = 1). Thus, we can achieve ((1, b, c)) in 2 steps. Afterwards, we can trivially set (b) and (c) to 0 in another 2 steps: - Set (b) to 0. - Set (c) to 0. Hence, four steps suffice if (b) and (c) are relatively prime. 4. **Making Two Numbers Relatively Prime:** If (b) and (c) are not relatively prime: - Consider the prime factors of (c) that do not divide (b). Denote their product by (d). If there are no such prime divisors, let (d = 1). - Change the tuple to ((a, b + da, c)). We need to show (b + da) and (c) are relatively prime. Suppose (p) is a prime divisor of (c), we show (p) does not divide (b + da): - If (p) divides (b), (p) does not divide (d) by definition, hence (p) does not divide (da). - If (p) does not divide (b), (p) divides (d) by definition, and (p) divides (da). In either case, (p) cannot divide (b + da), establishing that (b+da) and (c) are relatively prime. 5. **Achieving Relative Primality:** In a single step, we have achieved (b) and (c) being relatively prime.

For the base c, we have (1 / c)^18 on the left side and no corresponding base on the right side, so the exponent must be 0. However, since c is given to be divisible by both 3 and 7, it does not affect the equation in terms of finding m and n. For the base 5, we have (a / 5)^m on the left side and (5)^35 on the right side. Since m = 0, the exponent of 5 on the left side is 0, which matches the exponent of 5 on the right side. For the base 4, we have (b / 4)^n on the left side and (2)^35 on the right side. Since n = 0, the exponent of 4 on the left side is 0, which matches the exponent of 2 on the right side. Therefore, the values of m and n are both boxed{0} ."},{"prompt":"The Gropkas of Papua New Guinea have ten letters in their alphabet: A, E, G, I, K, O, R, U, and V.

Step 1: Identify the properties of f(x). Since f(x) is an even function, we have f(x) = f(-x) for all x in mathbb{R}. Therefore, for f(x) to be an even function, the absolute value function |x - m| should result in the same expression when x is replaced with -x. This implies that m = 0 because the absolute value function will only yield the same result for positive and negative values of x if it is centered around zero. Step 2: Evaluate a = f(-2). Given m = 0, we find a = f(-2) = 2^{|-2 - 0|} - 1 = 2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. Step 3: Evaluate b = f(log_2 5). Similarly, calculate b = f(log_2 5) = 2^{|log_2 5 - 0|} - 1 = 2^{log_2 5} - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4.

Thus, ( n = 1 ). 2. **Case when ( p ) is an odd prime:** We will use the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma. The LTE lemma states that for odd primes ( p ) and integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( x equiv y pmod{p} ), we have: [ v_p(x^n - y^n) = v_p(x - y) + v_p(n) ] Applying this to our problem, let ( x = 2 ) and ( y = 3 ): [ v_5(2^p + 3^p) = v_5(2 + 3) + v_5(p) ] Since ( 2 + 3 = 5 ), we have: [ v_5(2 + 3) = v_5(5) = 1 ] For any odd prime ( p neq 5 ), ( v_5(p) = 0 ).

The prime factorization of 275 is: [ 275 = 5^2 times 11 ] Since 275 is not a perfect power (i.e., it cannot be written as ( a^n ) for ( n > 1 )), we conclude that ( n = 1 ).

Clearly, ( N = 2 ) is sufficient. This can be illustrated as follows: - Two native people cross the river together, and each one tells their anecdote to the other. - Upon reaching the other side, each native knows 1 anecdote besides their own. Hence, ( N = 2 ) works for ( k = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step** Assume that for ( k = n ), ( N = 2^n ) is sufficient. We need to show that for ( k = n + 1 ), ( N = 2^{n+1} ) is also sufficient. - Divide the ( 2^{n+1} ) natives into two groups of ( 2^n ) natives each. - By the induction hypothesis, each native in each group of ( 2^n ) can be made to know at least ( n ) new anecdotes. - Next, we must combine these two groups: one native from each group crosses the river together. Since each knows at least ( n ) anecdotes from their group, after crossing and sharing anecdotes, each will know ( 2n ) anecdotes (half from each group), but we need only ( n+1 ) anecdotes. - Perform this crossing enough times, ensuring that each native from one group pairs with each native from another group at least once.

Now, add vector ( overrightarrow{OA} ) to both sides of the equation: [ overrightarrow{OX} = overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{AX} = overrightarrow{OA} + lambda (overrightarrow{OB} - overrightarrow{OA}) ] 5. Distribute ( lambda ) and combine like terms: [ overrightarrow{OX} = overrightarrow{OA} + lambda overrightarrow{OB} - lambda overrightarrow{OA} = (1 - lambda)overrightarrow{OA} + lambda overrightarrow{OB} ] 6. Letting ( t = lambda ), we can rewrite the equation as: [ overrightarrow{OX} = t overrightarrow{OB} + (1 - t) overrightarrow{OA} ] 7. This is the desired expression, showing that for some ( t ), the point ( X ) can be written as: [ overrightarrow{OX} = t overrightarrow{OB} + (1 - t) overrightarrow{OA} ] 8. Conversely, if: [ overrightarrow{OX} = t overrightarrow{OA} + (1 - t) overrightarrow{OB} ] is given, then by letting (lambda = (1 - t)), we have: [ overrightarrow{OX} = (1 - lambda) overrightarrow{OA} + lambda overrightarrow{OB} ] which is equivalent to: [ overrightarrow{AX} = lambda overrightarrow{AB} ] Conclusively, this proves the point.

This means we consider the coefficients modulo 2, so the polynomial ( x^2 + x + 1 ) simplifies to ( x^2 + x + 1 ) in ((mathbb{Z}/2mathbb{Z})[x]). 1. **Base Case Analysis:** Let's start by examining the polynomial for small values of ( n ): [ u_1(x) = x^2 + x + 1 ] [ u_2(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^2 = x^4 + x^2 + 1 ] Here, we see that ( u_2(x) ) has the same form as ( u_1(x) ) but with higher powers of ( x ). 2. **General Form:** We observe that the polynomial ( u_n(x) ) can be written as: [ u_n(x) = sum_{k=0}^{2n} a_k x^k ] where ( a_k ) are the coefficients. We need to determine which of these coefficients are odd. 3. **Binary Representation:** To find the number of odd coefficients, we need to consider the binary representation of ( n ). The polynomial ( (x^2 + x + 1)^n ) can be expanded using the multinomial theorem, and the coefficients ( a_k ) will be determined by the number of ways to choose terms from each factor such that the exponents sum to ( k ). 4. **Odd Coefficients:** The key insight is that a coefficient ( a_k ) is odd if and only if the number of ways to form ( k ) using the exponents ( 0, 1, 2 ) from each factor is odd. This is equivalent to counting the number of solutions to the equation: [ k = 2a + b + c quad text{(mod 2)} ] where ( a, b, c ) are the exponents chosen from each factor ( (x^2, x, 1) ). 5. **Pattern Recognition:** By examining the binary representation of ( n ), we can determine the number of odd coefficients. Specifically, the number of odd coefficients in ( u_n(x) ) is given by ( 2^m ), where ( m ) is the number of 1's in the binary representation of ( n ). 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the number of odd coefficients of the polynomial ( u_n(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)^n ) is ( 2^m ), where ( m ) is the number of 1's in the binary representation of ( n ).

Therefore, the time to complete one cycle for each bug is proportional to the perimeter of their respective triangles. 4. **Synchronization Check**: Since both bugs start at the same point A and start their journey simultaneously but travel in different directions along path AC, let's consider the movement through the diagonal AC. - For every complete cycle one bug makes, which brings it back to A, the other bug would have traversed its cycle and be at a specific point along its path. - Specifically, during these entry points into A for the first bug, the second bug would have moved a certain distance depending on its cycle length. We can compute the general positions of both bugs at any point in their cycles, knowing their speeds and the lengths they traverse. 5. **Evaluating Intersections**: The idea is to evaluate whether, for any two given positions they start with, the bugs would ever be at the same position on diagonal AC at the same time. - Since AB > CD, the movement of the second bug will not be a multiple of the movement of the first bug in their respective cycles. They will eventually need to cross paths on AC, simply due to the unequal perimeter path lengths combined with their equal speeds. 6. **Mathematical Proof of Intersection**: Because the bugs' cycles are based on triangles within the trapezoid and both fundamental paths involve AC, which is common and diagonally symmetrical, we can iteratively check every cycle endpoint for one bug to observe if the other bug meets the diagonal path AC. Therefore, with their constant and equal speeds, along with the inequalities inherent in their path distances, they must meet at some point on the diagonal AC. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The two bugs will inevitably meet on the diagonal AC of the trapezoid.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Mark has a garden with flowers.

A chord ( Gamma ) intersects ( C_k ) if one of its endpoints is to the right of ( C_k ) and the other is to the left of ( C_k ). This means we need to choose a point among the ( k-1 ) points to the right and one among the ( n-k ) points to the left. 8. The number of such intersecting chords (Gamma) is given by ( (k-1)(n-k) ). 9. Each intersection point created by ( C_k ) accounts for adding one more region. Hence, the total contribution of ( C_k ) to the number of new regions is ( (k-1)(n-k) + 1 ) (including ( C_k ) itself as a new separating chord). 10.

In simple random sampling, whether you replace the chosen individual before selecting the next one (sampling with replacement) or not (sampling without replacement) is a matter of the specific study design, but both approaches are compatible with the principles of simple random sampling.

Substitute these expressions into the given equation: frac{a sin B}{sin A} cos C + frac{a sin C}{sin A} cos B = a sin A. Dividing both sides by a, we get: sin B cos C + sin C cos B = sin A sin A. Applying the sine sum formula (sin(B + C) = sin B cos C + sin C cos B), we get: sin(B + C) = sin^2 A. Since A, B, and C are angles of a triangle, we know that A + B + C = 180^circ, which implies B + C = 180^circ - A. Therefore, sin(180^circ - A) = sin^2 A.

This helps in analyzing the problem using binary sequences. 2. **Case 1: ( n ) is odd**: - **Invariance Modulo 2**: When ( n ) is odd, the sum of the numbers (heads as 0 and tails as 1) is invariant modulo 2. This means that the sum of the sequence remains either even or odd after any number of operations. - **Equivalence Classes**: Since the sum modulo 2 is invariant, there are at least two equivalence classes: one for sequences with an even sum and one for sequences with an odd sum. - **Reduction to Constant Sequence**: To show that we can always obtain a constant sequence (all heads or all tails), consider a non-constant sequence. Divide it into maximal contiguous blocks of equal elements. Since ( n ) is odd, the number of blocks must be even (otherwise, the sum of the lengths of the blocks would be odd, contradicting the total length ( n )). Therefore, there exists a block of even length. We can flip all the values in that block, reducing the total number of blocks. By repeating this operation, we can eventually obtain a constant sequence. - **Conclusion for Odd ( n )**: Thus, for odd ( n ), there are exactly 2 distinct sequences that cannot be obtained from each other by applying the given operations: all heads and all tails. 3. **Case 2: ( n ) is even**: - **Binary Sequence Transformation**: For even ( n ), consider the binary sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). We transform this sequence into another sequence ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) where ( b_i equiv a_i + i pmod{2} ) for all ( i ).

Examples include: - Utility payments (electricity, water, etc.) - Loan payments - Taxes - Such expenses cannot be avoided or delayed as they are mandatory for the operation and legal compliance of the business. 2. **Variable Expenses**: - These are non-essential expenses that can arise from time to time and can be reduced or deferred without significantly impacting the business. Examples include: - Entertainment - Travel - Purchasing non-essential items - Services and rentals like renting professional video cameras - Maintenance of the blog (domain payments) - Such expenses can be managed more flexibly, and savings can be realized by making strategic changes. # Analysis of Given Expenses: Expenses that can be economized: 1. **Payment for home internet and internet traffic**: - Switching to a more cost-effective plan. - Using internet services more economically. 2. **Travel expenses**: - Booking tickets with discounts. - Traveling via more economical means, such as hitchhiking or using rented cars. 3. **Renting professional video cameras for a year**: - Renting cameras for shorter periods or under better conditions to save costs. 4. **Domain payment for blog maintenance**: - Selecting a cheaper domain hosting service to reduce ongoing maintenance costs. 5. **Visiting coffee shops (4 times a month)**: - Reducing the frequency of visits to 2 times a month. Expenses that cannot be economized: 1. **Loan payments**: - Essential as missing these payments can lead to significant penalties and financial repercussions. It's mandatory to meet these obligations timely. 2. **Tax payments**: - These are fixed and compulsory. Paying taxes is a civic duty, and non-payment can lead to legal consequences. 3. **Courses for qualification improvement in blogger school (onsite training)**: - Fixed price due to the uniqueness of the school in the city. Reducing costs here is not feasible due to the lack of alternatives. # Suggested Additional Expenses and Economizing Methods: 1. **Professional development workshops**: - Instead of attending expensive workshops, opt for online courses or webinars that offer similar content at a lower cost. 2. **Marketing and advertising costs**: - Switch to more cost-effective advertising methods such as social media marketing or collaborations with other bloggers for mutual promotion. 3. **Office supplies**: - Buy supplies in bulk or during sales to reduce costs. 4. **Subscription services (e.g., software, analytic tools)**: - Evaluate and potentially downgrade or cancel non-essential subscriptions. # Conclusion: In summary, fixed expenses such as loan payments, taxes, and certain essential courses cannot be economized.

The research and development of Teams A and B are independent, so the probability of both teams failing is the product of their individual failure probabilities: begin{align*} P(B) &= left(1 - frac{2}{3}right) times left(1 - frac{3}{5}right) &= frac{1}{3} times frac{2}{5} &= frac{2}{15}. end{align*} The probability of at least one new product being successfully developed is the complement of both failing, hence: begin{align*} P(A) &= 1 - P(B) &= 1 - frac{2}{15} &= frac{13}{15}. end{align*} Therefore, the probability of at least one new product being successfully developed is boxed{frac{13}{15}}. **Part (Ⅱ):** For the profit calculation, let X represent the company's profit. The possible outcomes for X are 0, 120, 100, and 220 thousand dollars, corresponding to different success/failure scenarios of the two teams. Calculating the probabilities of each profit outcome: begin{align*} P(X=0) &= left(1 - frac{2}{3}right) times left(1 - frac{3}{5}right) = frac{2}{15}, P(X=120) &= frac{2}{3} times left(1 - frac{3}{5}right) = frac{4}{15}, P(X=100) &= left(1 - frac{2}{3}right) times frac{3}{5} = frac{1}{5}, P(X=220) &= frac{2}{3} times frac{3}{5} = frac{2}{5}. end{align*} The distribution table of X is then: | X | 0 | 120 | 100 | 220 | |-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------| | P(X)| frac{2}{15} | frac{4}{15} | frac{1}{5} | frac{2}{5} | To find the expected value, use the formula for the expected value E(X) = sum x_i P(x_i): begin{align*} E(X) &= 0 times frac{2}{15} + 120 times frac{4}{15} + 100 times frac{1}{5} + 220 times frac{2}{5} &= 0 + frac{480}{15} + frac{100}{5} + frac{440}{5} &= 32 + 20 + 88 &= 140. end{align*} Therefore, the mean profit of the company is boxed{140} thousand dollars."},{"prompt":"a mixture of 90 litres, the ratio of milk to water is 2 : 1.

Determine the amount of liquid L and the final milktowater ratio.","completion":"Let's start by determining the initial amounts of milk and water in the 90-litre mixture. The ratio of milk to water is 2:1, which means that for every 2 parts of milk, there is 1 part of water. The total number of parts is 2 + 1 = 3 parts. The amount of milk in the mixture is (2/3) * 90 litres = 60 litres. The amount of water in the mixture is (1/3) * 90 litres = 30 litres. After evaporating 10 litres of water, the amount of water left is 30 litres - 10 litres = 20 litres. Now, we are told that an unknown liquid L is added such that the amount of liquid L is 1/3 of the amount of milk and the amount of milk is double the amount of water in the mixture. Let's denote the amount of liquid L as L litres. Since the amount of milk is double the amount of water, we have: Milk = 2 * Water Milk = 2 * 20 litres = 40 litres But we initially had 60 litres of milk, so no milk has been removed or added. Therefore, the amount of milk remains 60 litres. Now, since the amount of liquid L is 1/3 of the amount of milk, we have: L = (1/3) * Milk L = (1/3) * 60 litres = 20 litres So, 20 litres of liquid L is added to the mixture. Finally, let's determine the final milk-to-water ratio. We have 60 litres of milk and 20 litres of water (after evaporation and before adding liquid L). The final ratio of milk to water is 60:20, which simplifies to 3:1. In summary, 20 litres of liquid L is added to the mixture, and the final milk-to-water ratio is boxed{3:1} ."},{"prompt":"Given that [ frac{1}{3!18!} + frac{1}{4!17!} + frac{1}{5!16!} + frac{1}{6!15!} + frac{1}{7!14!} + frac{1}{8!13!} + frac{1}{9!12!} + frac{1}{10!11!} = frac{M}{1!20!}, ] find the greatest integer that is less than frac{M}{100}.","completion":"First, multiply both sides by 21!: [ frac{21!}{3!18!} + frac{21!}{4!17!} + frac{21!}{5!16!} + frac{21!}{6!15!} + frac{21!}{7!14!} + frac{21!}{8!13!} + frac{21!}{9!12!} + frac{21!}{10!11!} = frac{21!

This means it's impossible to have only one triangle covering the center because the fourth point will always create another triangle that also contains the center. - **Case 2: There are 3 or 4 triangles covering the center:** Assume the points are ( A, B, C, D ) going clockwise with respect to the center. If 3 or 4 triangles cover the center, this means two triangles sharing a diagonal cover the center. This is impossible because the diagonal must be on one side of the center (the probability of it lying exactly on the center is zero). This leads to a contradiction. 3. **Conclusion from the claim:** Either 0 or 2 triangles cover the center. If 4 points lie on a semicircle, then 0 triangles cover the center. The probability of this occurring is ( frac{1}{2} ) (as shown in the referenced proof). 4. **Calculate the probability:** - The probability that two triangles out of the four cover the center is ( frac{1}{2} ). - The probability of choosing one of these pairs of triangles is ( frac{5}{6} ) (since there are 6 possible pairs and 5 of them will include at least one of the triangles covering the center). 5. **Combine the probabilities:** [ text{Total probability} = frac{1}{2} times frac{5}{6} = frac{5}{12} ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{5}{12}})."},{"prompt":"A basketball team has 8 players with an average weight of 105.5 kg.

Since A and C have the same y-coordinate (p), and they both lie on the parabola, the axis of symmetry of the parabola must be exactly between x = n-2 and x = n. The axis of symmetry formula for a parabola y = ax^2 + bx + c is x = -frac{b}{2a}. In our case, a = -1 and b = 2m. 2. The axis of symmetry is also the midpoint between x = n-2 and x = n, which can be found by averaging these two x-values: frac{(n-2) + n}{2} = n-1. 3. Setting the two expressions for the axis of symmetry equal to each other gives us m = n-1. Therefore, we have m = n - 1. So, the answer for part (1) is boxed{n-1}. # Part 2: The Range of n Given -3 < q < p Given that the parabola opens downwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is negative), and knowing -3 < q < p, we analyze the position of points B and C relative to the axis of symmetry to find the range of n. 1. The vertex of the parabola (highest point since it opens downwards) lies on the axis of symmetry, which we've found to be x = m = n-1. 2. Since q < p and the parabola opens downwards, point C (with y-coordinate p) must be closer to the axis of symmetry than point B (with y-coordinate q), implying n must be positioned in such a way that C is closer to x = n-1 than B is. 3. When x = 0, y = -3, which is a point on the parabola. Given -3 < q < p, and considering the symmetry and the downward opening of the parabola, we deduce that n-1 (the axis of symmetry) must be closer to C than to B and the origin. 4. Solving the inequalities 3 < n < 4 or n > 6 ensures that the axis of symmetry is positioned correctly relative to points B and C to satisfy the condition -3 < q < p.

These work rates are the fractions of the job they can complete in one day. From the given information, we have: 1.

A and B together can complete the job in 12 days, so their combined work rate is 1/12 of the job per day. [ A_work + B_work = 1/12 ] 3. A can complete the job alone in 24 days, so A's work rate is 1/24 of the job per day. [ A_work = 1/24 ] Now, we can use these equations to find B's work rate.

[ C_work = 1/48 ] Now, let's substitute A_work and C_work back into equation 1 to find B's work rate: [ 1/24 + B_work + 1/48 = 1/8 ] To solve for B_work, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 24, 48, and 8 is 48.

The expression for y is a quadratic equation in terms of x, and we're interested in its value for x gt 3. To find out the range of y, we look at the minimum point of the quadratic equation y=x^{2}-4x+5. The vertex of a parabola given by y=ax^2+bx+c is at x=-frac{b}{2a}. In our case, a=1, b=-4, so the vertex is at x=2. Given x gt 3, the value of y for any x in A is greater than the value at the vertex. The value of y at x=2 is 2^2 - 4*2 + 5 = 1. However, since x gt 3, we should evaluate the function at the boundary of A, which is at x=3.

The shopkeeper sells 750 metres of cloth for 45,000, which means the selling price per metre is: 45,000 / 750 metres = 60 per metre The shopkeeper incurs a loss of 7 per metre, so the cost price per metre before the loss would be: 60 (selling price per metre) + 7 (loss per metre) = 67 per metre Now, we know that this price of 67 per metre is after a 5% discount. Let's denote the original price before the discount as ( P ). The discount is 5% of the original price, so the price after the discount is 95% of the original price.

(2 cdot 2 = 4) points must be connected by at least (2^2 + 1 = 5) line segments. - In a graph with 4 points, the maximum possible line segments without forming a triangle is binom{4}{2} - 1 = 5. - But this results in at least one triangle since the number of line segments exceeds binom{4}{2} = 6. If we try to avoid a triangle, the maximum number of lines we can have is 5, but here we need 6 lines, so a triangle is inevitable. Thus, T_2 holds true. 1.3 **Inductive Step**: Assume T_k is true for some k, i.e., if 2k points are connected by k^2 + 1 line segments, then these points must form a triangle. 1.4 We need to prove T_{k+1}: For 2(k+1) points, if they are connected by at least (k+1)^2 + 1 line segments, then they form at least one triangle. - Consider 2(k+1) points with at least (k+1)^2 + 1 line segments. Divide these points into two groups such as A_1 and A_2 with 2k points, note line segments within group A_1 and those connected with A_2. 1.5 Suppose p points in A connect to a point A from group G, and q points connect to a point B from G. - If p + q > 2k, there must be a triangular connection since one point in G is connected more than threshold linking triangles. - If p + q leq 2k, then the sum within each group is still intact forming k^2+1 must trigger the triangle formation based on assumed premise. Since in either case, the groups generate line segment surplus ensuring triangles even in aggregation totals, concluding proposition coverage. Thus, by mathematical induction, T_n is verified as true for all n > 1. Proof for Part (2): 1.6 Consider 2n points divided into two sets S and T with n points each. Every point in S connects with every point in T, making exactly n^2 line segments. 1.7 In each set S, T, no three points can form a triangle separately or collectively, thereby: - Shows structure doesn’t permit circuit of lines route composition towards triangle mix, just straights.

This is because, for frac{1}{x} where x is a positive number, as x increases, frac{1}{x} decreases, and the smallest value x can take to keep frac{1}{x} positive is greater than 1. **Step 2: Manipulating the given equation** From frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b}=1, we can manipulate the equation as follows: [ frac{a+b}{ab} = 1 implies ab = a + b ] This simplification leads us to: [ ab - a - b = 0 implies (a-1)(b-1) = 1 ] This reveals a critical relationship between a and b which is that (a-1)(b-1) = 1, indicating a multiplicative inverse relationship between a-1 and b-1. **Step 3: Finding the relationship between a and b** Given (a-1)(b-1) = 1, we can express a-1 in terms of b-1: [ a-1 = frac{1}{b-1} ] **Step 4: Applying AM-GM Inequality** We analyze the expression frac{a}{a-1}+frac{4b}{b-1} using the relationship a-1 = frac{1}{b-1} and recognizing that both a-1 and b-1 are positive: [ frac{a}{a-1}+frac{4b}{b-1} = 5 + frac{1}{a-1} + 4(a-1) ] We apply the AM-GM inequality to frac{1}{a-1} + 4(a-1), which states that for positive numbers x and y, frac{x+y}{2} geq sqrt{xy}, with equality if and only if x = y: [ 5 + frac{1}{a-1} + 4(a-1) geq 5 + 2sqrt{frac{1}{a-1} cdot 4(a-1)} = 5 + 2sqrt{4} = 9 ] The equality holds when frac{1}{a-1} = 4(a-1), which gives a=1+frac{1}{2} or a=frac{3}{2} because a>1. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the minimum value of frac{a}{a-1}+frac{4b}{b-1} given the conditions is boxed{9}."},{"prompt":"Given real numbers x and y that satisfy the equation {x}^{2}+{y}^{2}=1, determine the range of possible values for frac{y+2}{x+1}.","completion":"This problem primarily assesses the understanding of finding the slope between two points, the relationship between a line and a circle in terms of tangency and intersection, and the application of geometric reasoning to solve algebraic expressions. Let's begin by denoting k=frac{y-(-2)}{x-(-1)}. In this context, k represents the slope of the line connecting a moving point P on the circle {x}^{2}+{y}^{2}=1 and a fixed point A(-1,-2). When the line is tangent to the circle, the slope k can be determined. The equation of the tangent line can be written as y+2=k(x+1), which reduces to the general form kx-y+k-2=0. To establish an equation in terms of k, we use the condition for a line and a circle to be tangent: frac{|k-2|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} = 1 Solving this equation yields k = frac{3}{4}. From the given conditions and the position of point P, we know that the limiting slope k is frac{3}{4}. Since the x-coordinate of point A is the same as the x-coordinate of the point where the unit circle intersects the x-axis, the angle of inclination of the tangent line passing through point A is 90^{circ}.

Here, Delta = 3, so we may need either 3 or 4 colors. - **Lower Bound**: Since each vertex can connect to 3 other vertices, we can't guarantee that 3 colors are sufficient without verifying it on this specific graph. 5. **Detailed Solution**: - Consider the constraints: - There are 20 vertices. - Each vertex (telephone machine) connects to at most 3 other vertices. - To satisfy the requirement that lines from any one telephone machine have different colors, we inspect a few specific structures (cycles and chains): - **Cycle**: Any cycle in this graph must respect the degree constraints. Since every vertex has a degree of 3, the cycles that occur in the maximum set would dictate coloring complexity. - **Chains**: Chains can be simplified, but in combination with cycles, distinguishable cases complete the complexity. - We start by analyzing if 3 colors suffice: - Since we know each vertex is involved in at most 3 edges, a degree-3 vertex coloring problem suggests testing a 3-color strategy. - However, if cycles' lengths aren't even, at least one cycle will demand an extra color. The extra handling guarantees the possibility of up to Delta + 1 = 4 colors. - **Step-by-Step Process Verification**: - **Step 1**: Find the longest cycle. - **Step 2**: Color its edges using either 3 colors if possible, otherwise involve a 4th color for odd lengths. - **Step 3**: Remove the cycle and all dangling edges (edges leading out from vertices of the cycle). Analyze remaining parts for simplifiable sections. - **Step 4**: Continually break down the new longest cycle until none remains. - **Step 5**: After breaking cycles, inspect chains or isolated vertices: - Ensure new colors if it yields three edges ending at a vertex requiring a non-redundant color. - **Analysis for Eccentric case**: A vertex with 3 edges can't consistently get colored if neighbors share required remaining only color distinct but overlapping in next analysis chains. 6. **Conclusion**: - From comprehensive step reductions and infallible combinations of needing distinct colors: - **Four-color solution** reliably accommodates the constraints: [ boxed{4} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a circle that is tangent to the yaxis at the point (0, 3) and intersects the xaxis with a segment length of 8, the standard equation of the circle is ______.","completion":"According to the problem, it is known that the circle is tangent to the y-axis at the point (0, 3), so we set the center of the circle as (a, 3), then its radius r = |a|, and since the length of the segment that the circle intersects with the x-axis is 8, we have r^2 = left( frac{8}{2} right)^2 + 3^2 = 25, which means r = 5, thus a = pm 5, therefore, the equation of the circle is (x + 5)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25 or (x - 5)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25. According to the problem, setting the center of the circle as (a, 3), it can be analyzed that its radius r = |a|. Also, since the length of the segment that the circle intersects with the x-axis is 8, it can be analyzed that r^2 = left( frac{8}{2} right)^2 + 3^2 = 25, which allows us to find the radius and the coordinates of the center of the circle. Substituting these into the standard equation of the circle gives the answer. This problem examines the standard equation of a circle, noting the need to analyze the relationship between the center and the radius of the circle according to the problem.

Move all the terms involving (b) to one side: [ ab + 2 = a^3 + 2b implies ab - 2b = a^3 - 2 ] 2. Factor out (b) on the left-hand side: [ b(a - 2) = a^3 - 2 ] From this, we see that (a - 2) must be a divisor of (a^3 - 2), and: [ b = frac{a^3 - 2}{a - 2} ] Next, we need to determine when (a - 2) divides (a^3 - 2). To simplify (a^3 - 2), we use polynomial long division or the remainder theorem: 3. Simplify the expression: [ a^3 - 2 = (a - 2)left(frac{a^3-2}{a-2}right) + R ] 4. Using polynomial long division: Divide (a^3 - 2) by (a - 2): [ a^3 - 2 = (a - 2)(a^2 + 2a + 4) + 6 ] This confirms: [ a - 2 mid a^3 - 2 Rightarrow a - 2 mid 6 ] Thus (a - 2) must be a divisor of 6.

The total distance covered by the train when crossing the platform is: Distance = Length of the train (L) + Length of the platform (300 meters) The time taken to cross the platform is given as 30 seconds. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Substituting the known values: 30 seconds = (L + 300 meters) / 20 m/s Now, let's solve for L: 30 seconds × 20 m/s = L + 300 meters 600 meters = L + 300 meters L = 600 meters - 300 meters L = 300 meters So, the length of the train is 300 meters. When the train crosses the man standing on the platform, it only has to cover its own length, as the man can be considered as a point relative to the length of the train. Using the same formula for time: Time to cross the man = Length of the train / Speed of the train Time to cross the man = L / 20 m/s Time to cross the man = 300 meters / 20 m/s Time to cross the man = 15 seconds Therefore, it takes boxed{15} seconds for the train to cross the man standing on the platform."},{"prompt":"f x divided by 4, multiplied by 5, added by 10, subtracted by 12 equals some number, and x equals 40.
