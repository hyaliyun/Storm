Each square alternating around a hexagon is surrounded on its four sides by two squares and two hexagons. By coloring squares B and C alternatively around each hexagon and ensuring adjacent hexagons use the same color scheme but shifted appropriately, we do not end any adjacent squares sharing a color. Final color count checks reveal three distinct colors are needed: one for all hexagons and two alternating for squares.

Both sets are non-empty. - Thus, the base case holds. - **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for ( p-1 ). We need to show it holds for ( p ). - Let ( X ) have ( pq - q + 1 ) elements. - Count the pairs ( (x, A) ) where ( x in X ) and ( A ) is one of the ( p ) subsets containing ( x ). - This count is ( pq ) because there are ( p ) subsets each with ( q ) elements. - On the other hand, the count is ( sum_{i=1}^{(p-1)q+1} n(x_i) ), where ( n(x_i) ) is the number of subsets containing ( x_i ). - Since ( 2((p-1)q+1) > 2(p-1)q > pq ), there is at least one ( x_i ) with ( n(x_i) leq 1 ). - Choose this ( x_i ) as one of the elements of ( Y ), and eliminate the ( q ) elements of one of the ( p ) subsets. - If ( x_i ) belongs to no subset, choose any subset. If ( x_i ) belongs to a subset, eliminate that subset. - Now, we have reduced the problem to ( p-1 ) subsets and ( (p-1)q - q + 1 ) elements. - By the induction hypothesis, we can find the remaining ( p-1 ) elements of ( Y ). - Thus, the statement holds for ( p ).

These conditions suggest that the triangles are similar since they have corresponding angles equal.

Consider the set ( A ) which consists of 2009 points in the plane, none of which are collinear. 2. Define an internal triangle as a triangle whose vertices are points in ( A ). 3. We aim to show that each point of ( A ) lies inside an even number of internal triangles. To prove this, we use mathematical induction and some combinatorial arguments involving triangulations and parity (even or odd properties). Step-by-Step Explanation: 1st Solution Detailed Steps: 1. Consider a subset ( B ) of 2008 points from ( A ). Let ( P notin B ) be the additional point such that no three points from ( B cup {P} ) are collinear. 2. Define ( alpha(P) ) to be the number of triangles with vertices in ( B ) that contain ( P ) inside them. 3. The lines connecting pairs of points in ( B ) divide the plane into finite polygonal regions. Importantly, ( alpha(P) ) does not change if ( P ) moves within a single polygonal region. 4. Observe that if ( P ) lies outside the convex hull of ( B ), ( alpha(P) = 0 ). This number is even. 5. It suffices to show that ( alpha(P) ) changes by an even number when ( P ) crosses from one region to another neighboring region. Next, consider two neighboring regions separated by a line segment ( XY ): 6. Assume there are ( k ) points from ( B ) on the same side of the line ( XY ) as ( P ). 7. There are ( 2008 - k ) points from ( B ) on the opposite side. 8. As ( P ) crosses the line segment ( XY ) to enter the neighboring area: - ( P ) leaves exactly ( k ) internal triangles that have ( XY ) as a side, with the third vertex on the same side of ( XY ) as ( P ). - ( P ) enters exactly ( 2008 - k ) internal triangles where the third vertex is on the opposite side. 9. Thus, the change in ( alpha(P) ) when crossing the line ( XY ) is given by: [ (2008 - k) - k = 2008 - 2k = 2(1004 - k) ] 10. Since ( 2(1004 - k) ) is always even, it follows that ( alpha(P) ) changes by an even number each time ( P ) crosses into a new region. This proves that ( alpha(P) ) is always even, showing that each point ( P ) lies inside an even number of internal triangles.

In all cases, it's evident that each point lies inside none or exactly two triangles formed by the other points. Next, the generalization to 2009 points: 1. Let ( P in A ) be a fixed point that lies within ( m ) internal triangles. 2. Count the pairs ( (Delta, Q) ), where ( Delta ) is an internal triangle containing ( P ) and ( Q ) is another distinct point from ( A ). 3. For each internal triangle ( Delta ) with vertices not containing ( P ): - There are ( m ) ways to pick ( Delta ). - There are ( 2005 ) ways to pick ( Q ) from the remaining points. 4. Thus, there are ( 2005m ) such pairs ( (Delta, Q) ). 5.

For each triangle ( Delta_1 ) containing ( P ), identify the unique triangles formed by including another vertex ( Q in A setminus {P} ): - ( Delta_1 ) can be chosen in ( n ) ways. - For each ( Delta_1 ), there are ( 2005 ) points to form a new triangle: sums to ( 2005n ) choices.

Here are the steps to achieve this: 1. **Understand the Composition of the Figures**: The initial figure is made up of several equilateral triangles. By counting the number of these triangles, we can determine the side length of the desired hexagon. Let's denote each small equilateral triangle’s side length as (a). 2. **Determining the Side Length of the Hexagon**: The side length of the hexagon (s) must be such that the area of the hexagon matches the area of the initial figure. Assuming the initial figure comprises 6 small equilateral triangles arranged in a specific pattern, the side of the hexagon can be deduced as follows: [ s approx frac{text{(number of triangles in initial figure)}}{6} ] In this case, from visual inspection, if the initial figure contains 12 such triangles, then: [ s = 2a ] 3. **Utilizing Symmetry**: Given that the figure has rotational symmetry, we can attempt to draw lines from the center of the figure to the vertices, splitting it into symmetric parts. Each part should be a group of triangles that is symmetric about the center. 4. **Drawing the Cuts**: To divide the figure into three equal parts, draw three lines from the center of the figure to three vertices that are equally spaced around the center. This essentially divides the original figure into three equal segments. Each segment will include a combination of triangles that together will sum up to the required area for one-third of the hexagon. 5. **Reconfiguration to Form a Hexagon**: Once split into three parts, rearrange these pieces to form a regular hexagon. Each segment will align next to another segment since each segment's edges are designed to fit perfectly with the adjacent segment.

First Method: Using the Formula Consider the definition of the binomial coefficient, which is given by the formula: binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. We can express both sides of the identity using this formula. 1. The left-hand side of the equation is: binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. 2. For the right-hand side, we separately compute each term binom{n-1}{k} and binom{n-1}{k-1}: - binom{n-1}{k}: binom{n-1}{k} = frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!}. - binom{n-1}{k-1}: binom{n-1}{k-1} = frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!}. 3. Add these two expressions: binom{n-1}{k} + binom{n-1}{k-1} = frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} + frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!}. 4. To combine these fractions, find a common denominator: frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-1-k)!} + frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} = frac{(n-1)! (n-k) + (n-1)! k}{k!(n-1-k)!(k-1)!(n-k)}. 5. Simplify the numerator: frac{(n-1)! cdot (n-k) + (n-1)! cdot k}{k!(n-1-k)!(n-k)!}. 6. Factor out (n-1)!: = frac{(n-1)!(n-k+k)}{k!(n-1-k)!(n-k)!} = frac{(n-1)! cdot n}{k!(n-1-k)!(n-k)!}. 7. Recognize that the numerator is n!: frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = binom{n}{k}. Thus, we have shown that: binom{n}{k} = binom{n-1}{k} + binom{n-1}{k-1}. Second Method: Combinatorial Proof Let us consider the set {1, 2, ldots, n} and count its subsets with exactly k elements. 1. There are binom{n}{k} subsets of size k. 2. Now, consider subsets that do not contain the element n. These subsets must be chosen from {1, 2, ldots, n-1}. Therefore, there are exactly binom{n-1}{k} such subsets. 3. Next, consider the subsets that include the element n. Once we include n, we need to choose k-1 more elements from {1, 2, ldots, n-1}. Therefore, there are exactly binom{n-1}{k-1} such subsets. 4. By combining both cases: binom{n}{k} = binom{n-1}{k} + binom{n-1}{k-1}.

The key to this problem is to grasp the characteristics of three-digit numbers that can be divided by 5 (the last digit is 0 or 5), and pay attention to the classification discussion and the restriction that the first digit cannot be 0 when arranging numbers."},{"prompt":"Given that the Cartesian coordinates of point M are (1, sqrt {3}), find the polar coordinates of point M.","completion":"First, we find the radius (ρ) using the distance formula: ρ = sqrt{(-1)^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = 2 Next, we find the angle (θ) using the trigonometric function cosine: cos θ = -frac{1}{2} The angle that satisfies this equation is θ = frac{2π}{3}.

Each element ( a_i ) satisfies ( f(a_i) < 2003 ) and ( f(a_i) = f(a_j) ) for all ( i, j ) in ( {1, 2, ldots, 2004} ), where ( f(a_i) ) denotes the number of elements that are relatively prime to ( a_i ). 2. **Graph Representation:** Construct a graph ( G_{2004} ) with 2004 vertices, where each vertex ( u_i ) corresponds to an element ( a_i ) from the set ( S ). Connect vertices ( u_i ) and ( u_j ) if ( gcd(a_i, a_j) > 1 ). 3. **Degree of Vertices:** Since ( f(a_i) ) is the number of elements relatively prime to ( a_i ), the number of elements not relatively prime to ( a_i ) is ( 2004 - f(a_i) ). Given ( f(a_i) < 2003 ), we have ( 2004 - f(a_i) geq 1 ).

Let ( n ) be the side length of the desired cubic structure. To calculate the total volume of the cubic structure, we use the formula for the volume of a cube: [ V = n^3 ] 3. Since each tile has a volume of 24 cubic units, the number of tiles needed, (m), can be expressed as: [ m = frac{n^3}{24} ] 4. For (m) to be an integer, ( frac{n^3}{24} ) must also be an integer. This implies that ( n^3 ) must be a multiple of 24. 5. The prime factorization of 24 is (2^3 times 3). Hence, ( n^3 ) must be divisible by both (2^3) and (3). 6. Thus, (n) itself must be at least divisible by (2 times 3 = 6). Let: [ n = 6k ] where (k) is an integer. 7. Plugging (n = 6k) into the volume equation, we get: [ (6k)^3 = 216k^3 ] 8.

So the probability of drawing a non-defective pen first is: P(Non-defective first) = Number of non-defective pens / Total number of pens P(Non-defective first) = 7 / 10 Next, we calculate the probability of selecting a non-defective pen on the second draw, given that the first pen selected was non-defective. Since we've already taken one non-defective pen out of the box, there are now 6 non-defective pens left out of a total of 9 pens (because we've already removed one pen from the box). So the probability of drawing a non-defective pen second is: P(Non-defective second | Non-defective first) = Number of remaining non-defective pens / Total remaining pens P(Non-defective second | Non-defective first) = 6 / 9 Now, to find the overall probability that both pens selected are non-defective, we multiply the two probabilities together: P(Both non-defective) = P(Non-defective first) * P(Non-defective second | Non-defective first) P(Both non-defective) = (7 / 10) * (6 / 9) Simplifying the fractions: P(Both non-defective) = (7 / 10) * (2 / 3) P(Both non-defective) = (7 * 2) / (10 * 3) P(Both non-defective) = 14 / 30 P(Both non-defective) = 7 / 15 So the probability that neither of the two pens selected will be defective is boxed{7/15} ."},{"prompt":"Calculate: 2023^{0}left(27right)times 3^{3}=______.","completion":"To calculate 2023^{0}-left(-27right)times 3^{-3}, we follow the steps below: 1.

Using this relationship and the basic inequality, we can find the minimum value of frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b}. First, let's find the relationship between a and b. Since the circle is symmetric about the line 2ax - by + 2 = 0, the line must pass through the center of the circle. The center of the circle is (-1, 2), so substituting -1 for x and 2 for y in the equation of the line gives us: 2a(-1) - b(2) + 2 = 0, which simplifies to a + b = 1. Now, we want to minimize frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b}. Using the relationship a + b = 1, we can rewrite frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b} as frac{4(a + b)}{a} + frac{a + b}{b} = frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + 5. By the AM-GM inequality, we have frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b} geq 2sqrt{frac{4b}{a} cdot frac{a}{b}} = 4, so frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + 5 geq 9. Equality occurs when frac{4b}{a} = frac{a}{b}, or a = 2b.

Since its determinant is zero, ( A^2 + xI_2 ) is singular, meaning it has at least one eigenvalue equal to zero. 2. Let ( lambda ) be an eigenvalue of ( A ). Then, ( lambda^2 + x = 0 ) because ( det(A^2 + xI_2) = 0 ). Solving for ( lambda ), we get: [ lambda^2 = -x implies lambda = pm isqrt{x} ] Therefore, the eigenvalues of ( A ) are ( isqrt{x} ) and ( -isqrt{x} ). 3. The trace of ( A ), which is the sum of its eigenvalues, is: [ text{tr}(A) = isqrt{x} + (-isqrt{x}) = 0 ] 4.

The characteristic polynomial of ( A ) is given by: [ lambda^2 - (text{tr}(A))lambda + det(A) = lambda^2 + x ] By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, ( A ) satisfies its own characteristic polynomial: [ A^2 + xI_2 = 0 implies A^2 = -xI_2 ] 6.

We've already accounted for the time it takes to sew the skirts (12 hours), so the remaining time must be the time it takes to sew the 4 coats. Therefore, the time taken to sew 4 coats is ( 40 - 12 = 28 ) hours. To find the time it takes to sew one coat, we divide the total time for 4 coats by 4: ( C = frac{28}{4} = 7 ) hours.

This ensures that none of the eigenvalues of ( A ) will make ( A + k_jI ) singular. - Construct a diagonal matrix ( D ) with these chosen eigenvalues: [ D = begin{pmatrix} lambda_1 & 0 & cdots & 0 0 & lambda_2 & cdots & 0 vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots 0 & 0 & cdots & lambda_m end{pmatrix} ] 3. **Ensuring Integer Entries**: - To ensure that ( A ) has integer entries, we can use a matrix ( P ) with integer entries and determinant 1 (i.e., ( P ) is unimodular). This ensures that ( P^{-1} ) also has integer entries. - Construct ( A ) as ( A = PDP^{-1} ). Since ( P ) and ( P^{-1} ) have integer entries, ( A ) will also have integer entries. 4. **Verification**: - For each ( j ), consider the matrix ( A + k_jI ): [ A + k_jI = PDP^{-1} + k_jI = P(D + k_jI)P^{-1} ] - The matrix ( D + k_jI ) is diagonal with entries ( lambda_i + k_j ). Since ( lambda_i ) were chosen such that ( lambda_i neq -k_j ), each ( lambda_i + k_j neq 0 ). Thus, ( D + k_jI ) is invertible. - Since ( P ) and ( P^{-1} ) are invertible with integer entries, ( A + k_jI ) is also invertible with integer entries. Conclusion: We have constructed a matrix ( A ) with integer entries such that each ( A + k_jI ) is invertible with integer entries.

Our task is to find the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on the board, avoiding the red squares. 2. **Division of the board**: Observe that the red square occupies the top-left 88 times 88 area of the 101 times 101 board. This means that the remaining, non-red part of the board includes a vertical 13 times 101 strip on the right and a horizontal 101 times 13 strip on the bottom. 3. **Counting available rows and columns**: a. Consider 13 vertical strips of size 1 times 101 along the rightmost edge. b. Similarly, consider 13 horizontal strips of size 101 times 1 along the bottom edge. 4. **Placement strategy**: A fundamental property of queens is that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal. Since we are to ensure the queens are not placed on any red squares, we can utilize the 13 rows and 13 columns that are free of red squares. 5. **Maximum number of queens**: We can place one queen in each of the 13 vertical strips while ensuring they do not align in the same row, and one queen in each of the 13 horizontal strips ensuring they do not overlap columns.

The price of a candy box was increased by 25%. The increase in price is 25% of 15 pounds: ( 0.25 times 15 = 3.75 ) pounds. So the new price of the candy box is: ( 15 + 3.75 = 18.75 ) pounds. The price of a can of soda was increased by 50%. The increase in price is 50% of 6 pounds: ( 0.50 times 6 = 3 ) pounds. So the new price of the can of soda is: ( 6 + 3 = 9 ) pounds.

Let's denote the original price of the candy box as ( C ) and the original price of the can of soda as ( S ). After the price increase, the candy box costs ( C + 0.25C = 1.25C ), and we know this equals 18.75 pounds.

Knowing the sum of the digits in his house number must also be 25, we aim to construct the largest possible four-digit number with distinct digits that sum up to 25. 3. To maximize the house number, we start with the largest possible digit in the thousands place, which is 9. Subtracting 9 from the total sum leaves us with: [25 - 9 = 16.] 4. The remaining sum of 16 must be achieved with three distinct digits. The largest digit we can use next, considering distinctness and maximizing the number, is 8. Subtracting 8 from the remaining sum gives us: [16 - 8 = 8.] 5. With 8 left for the sum of the last two digits, and considering the digits must be distinct and cannot repeat the 8, the largest combination is 7 and 1, which indeed adds up to 8: [7 + 1 = 8.] 6.

Firstly, consider the binomial expansion of (1-x)^6 and (1+x)^4. However, noting that (1-x)^6 will generate terms of x^2 and higher powers with negative coefficients due to the odd powers of -x, and we are interested in the coefficient of x^2 only, we can simplify our problem by using (1-x^2)^4 to find the x^2 term, since any higher powers of x from (1-x)^6 would not contribute to the x^2 term when multiplied by (1+x)^4. Now, we focus on (1-x^2)^4(1-2x+x^2). Here, (1-x^2)^4 can be expanded using the binomial theorem, and we are particularly interested in the constant and the x^2 term of this expansion, since multiplying these by the corresponding terms in (1-2x+x^2) could give us a term with x^2 in the final expansion. Considering the binomial expansion given by: (1-x^2)^4 = binom{4}{0} - binom{4}{1} x^2 + text{(terms with higher powers of } x), we see that the required terms are 1 (the constant term) and -binom{4}{1} x^2 = -4x^2. The next component is 1-2x+x^2. We can ignore -2x since its product with the constant term or the x^2 term from (1-x^2)^4 will not yield an x^2 term in the final expansion. Thus, we consider the multiplication of the -4x^2 term from (1-x^2)^4 and the constant term 1 from (1-2x+x^2) as well as the constant term from (1-x^2)^4 and the x^2 term from (1-2x+x^2), and summing them together to find the coefficient of x^2: (-4x^2)cdot1 + 1cdot x^2 = -4x^2 + x^2 = -3x^2.

This means that, for instance, if the digit sum of one number is (a+b), the adjacent number's digit sum must be either (a+b+1) or (a+b-1). 3. **Parity Consideration:** The sum of the digits of the numbers from 00 to 99 varies as follows: [ 00, 01, ..., 09 quad (text{digit sums: } 0, 1, ..., 9) 10, 11, ..., 19 quad (text{digit sums: } 1, 2, ..., 10) ..., quad 90, 91, ..., 99 quad (text{digit sums: } 9, 10, ..., 18) ] Importantly, before rearrangement, the parity (whether they are even or odd) of the digit sums follows a specific pattern: half of the numbers will have an even sum and the other half will have an odd sum. This happens similarly for the positional indices, i.e., every second number. 4. **Rearrangement Parity Constraint:** For the newly rearranged sequence to conform to the problem’s constraints, the parity of the digit sums must still follow the same pattern (i.e., every adjacent number can have a sum differing by exactly 1). Therefore, only numbers that already followed this parity pattern can remain in their positions after such a rearrangement. 5. **Number of Fixed Positions:** Since half of the original sequence followed a matching parity and the mentioned constraints must be met to avoid violating the adjacency rule, we deduce that at a minimum, 50 of the numbers either retain their positions or fit these constraints after rearrangement. 6. **Constructing the Example Sequence:** Let's illustrate a sequence where exactly 50 numbers remain in their initial places: [ 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 20, 21, 22, ..., 29, 39, 38, 37, ..., 30, 50, ..., 59, 69, ..., 60, 70, ..., 79, 89, ..., 80, 90, ..., 99. ] Here, each even tens place (like 20 to 29) retains its exact sequence, while the odd tens (like 19 descending to 10, 39 descending to 30) are reversed, keeping 50 numbers in their original positions. # Conclusion: Hence, the maximum number of numbers that can stay in their original positions is ( boxed{50} )."},{"prompt":"Let M=a+ frac {1}{a2} (2<a<3), and N=log_{ frac {1}{2}}(x^2+ frac {1}{16}) (xin mathbb{R}).

We want the new total cost to be the same as the previous year, so: ( N times P = N' times P' ) Substituting ( N' ) we get: ( N times P = N times 0.91 times P' ) Dividing both sides by ( N times P ) to solve for ( P' ): ( 1 = 0.91 times frac{P'}{P} ) ( frac{P'}{P} = frac{1}{0.91} ) ( frac{P'}{P} = 1.098901098901099 ) This means that the new price ( P' ) is approximately 109.8901098901099% of the original price ( P ).

This symmetry implies that f(2 - x) = f(x). Now let's use this to find the value of a that satisfies f(a-1) = f(5). Considering the symmetry of f(x) with respect to x = 1, we have: [ f(2 - (a - 1)) = f(a - 1) = f(5). ] This simplifies to: [ f(3 - a) = f(5). ] Because f(x) is symmetric, f(3 - a) will equal f(5) if 3 - a is either equal to 5 or symmetrically opposite to 5 with respect to the line x = 1.

Since the graph is symmetric with respect to the line x = 1, for f(3 - a) = f(5) we need to find the distance of 5 to the line x = 1 and then apply the same distance on the other side of the line. Distance of 5 from the line x = 1 is 5 - 1 = 4, thus: [ 3 - a = 1 - 4, ] [ -a = -6, ] [ a = 6. ] So, the correct values of a are obtained by solving the equations from the two cases: Case 1: 3 - a = 5 yields a = -2 (which is incorrect). Case 2: 3 - a = 1 - 4 yields a = 6 (which is correct). Due to the symmetry property and the condition f(3 - a) = f(5), we see that a must also satisfy 3 - a = -(5 - 1) + 1. Therefore: [ 3 - a = -4 + 1, ] [ 3 - a = -3, ] [ a = 3 + 3, ] [ a = 6. ] However, we must also consider the possibility that 5 is the symmetric point itself, meaning a-1 can be equal to 5. In this case: [ a - 1 = 5, ] [ a = 5 + 1, ] [ a = 6. ] There is also the possibility that a - 1 is on the symmetric position of x = 5 with respect to the line x = 1, which means the value is on the left side of the line of symmetry and has the same distance from the symmetry line as the number 5. Thus: [ a - 1 = 2 * 1 - 5, ] [ a - 1 = 2 - 5, ] [ a - 1 = -3, ] [ a = -3 + 1, ] [ a = -2. ] Upon reviewing the two values a = -2 and a = 6, we realize that a = -2 does not satisfy f(a-1) = f(5) because f(-2 - 1) = f(-3). Since f(-3) would be symmetrical to f(3) (not f(5)), it can't be equal to f(5). The only valid solution is thus a = 6.

We are given that f'(t) = 2t, so we can integrate f'(t) to find f(t): ∫(2t dt) from 0 to 1 = [t^2] from 0 to 1 = 1^2 - 0^2 = 1 However, we are also given that f(0) = 2 and f(1) = 50, which means the function f(t) has a constant term that we need to add to the integral result to match these conditions. Let's call this constant term C. So, f(t) = t^2 + C Using the given values of f(t) at t=0 and t=1, we can find C: f(0) = 0^2 + C = 2, so C = 2 f(1) = 1^2 + C = 50, so C = 49 But since we have already found that w = 0, and the integral of f(t) from 0 to 1 is supposed to equal w, there seems to be a contradiction because the integral we calculated is 1, not 0. Let's re-evaluate the integral with the constant term C included: ∫(t^2 + C dt) from 0 to 1 = [t^3/3 + Ct] from 0 to 1 = (1/3 + C) - (0 + 0) = 1/3 + C Since we found C = 2 from f(0) = 2, the integral becomes: 1/3 + 2 = 2 + 1/3 = 6/3 + 1/3 = 7/3 But this result does not match the value of w we found from the sum of the numbers (w = boxed{0)} . There seems to be an inconsistency in the information provided. If w is indeed the integral of f(t) from 0 to 1, then the sum of the numbers x, y, z, and w cannot be 500 with the given conditions.

The earnings from the 4 books sold at 2.50 each would be: Earnings from books sold at 2.50 each = Number of books * Price per book Earnings from books sold at 2.50 each = 4 books * 2.50/book = 10 Now, we can find out how much Lovely earns from the 6 books sold at a lower price: Earnings from books sold at a lower price = Total earnings - Earnings from books sold at 2.50 each Earnings from books sold at a lower price = 22 - 10 = 12 Finally, we can find the price of each book sold at a lower price by dividing the total earnings from these books by the number of books: Price of each book sold at a lower price = Earnings from books sold at a lower price / Number of books sold at a lower price Price of each book sold at a lower price = 12 / 6 books = 2 per book Therefore, the price of the books sold at a lower price is boxed{2} each."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = 2^x + m defined on the interval [3, 3] and satisfying f(2) = 6, the probability that the value of f(x) is not greater than 3 when taking any real number x in [3, 3] is ( ).

Clearly, 1 divides 2. - If a = 2 and b = 1, then (a-b)^2 = (2-1)^2 = 1^2 = 1 and ab = 2 cdot 1 = 2. Again, 1 divides 2. Thus, the base case holds. Inductive Step: Assume that for some n geq 2, there exists a set S = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} of n integers such that (a-b)^2 divides ab for every distinct a, b in S. We need to show that there exists a set T of n+1 integers with the same property. Define m = a_1a_2 cdots a_n. Consider the set T = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n, b_{n+1}} where b_i = a_i + km for i = 1, 2, ldots, n and b_{n+1} = m + km. Here, k is a positive integer to be determined.

Since (a_i - a_j)^2 divides a_ia_j by the induction hypothesis, and a_i mid b_i, a_j mid b_j, it follows that (b_i - b_j)^2 divides b_ib_j. Now, consider b_{n+1} and any b_i for i leq n: b_{n+1} - b_i = (m + km) - (a_i + km) = m - a_i. Thus, (b_{n+1} - b_i)^2 = (m - a_i)^2. We need to ensure that (m - a_i)^2 divides b_{n+1}b_i. Since b_{n+1} = m + km and b_i = a_i + km, we have: b_{n+1}b_i = (m + km)(a_i + km). To ensure (m - a_i)^2 divides b_{n+1}b_i, choose k such that: k+1 = (m-a_1)^2(m-a_2)^2 cdots (m-a_n)^2.

This means that x can be expressed as: x = 52k + 19 where k is some integer. 2. For the second integer y, when multiplied by 3, the remainder is 5. This means that 3y can be expressed as: 3y = 7m + 5 where m is some integer. To find y, we can divide both sides by 3: y = (7m + 5) / 3 Since we are looking for a remainder when y is multiplied by 3, we need to find a value of y that, when multiplied by 3, gives a remainder of 5 when divided by 7. We can test values of m to find a suitable y. Let's test m = 0: y = (7*0 + 5) / 3 y = 5 / 3 This does not give us an integer value for y, so m = 0 is not suitable. Let's test m = 1: y = (7*1 + 5) / 3 y = (7 + 5) / 3 y = 12 / 3 y = 4 When y = 4, multiplying by 3 gives us 12, which leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7 (since 12 = 7 + 5). Therefore, y = 4 is a suitable value. 3. Now we need to find the remainder when (x + 2y)^2 is divided by 7. We know that x = 52k + 19 and y = 4. Let's substitute y into the expression: (x + 2y)^2 = (52k + 19 + 2*4)^2 = (52k + 19 + 8)^2 = (52k + 27)^2 Since we are looking for the remainder when this expression is divided by 7, we only need to consider the remainder of 52k + 27 when divided by 7. 52k is a multiple of 7 (since 52 is 7 times 7 plus 3, so 52k will also be a multiple of 7), so it will not affect the remainder. We only need to consider the remainder of 27 when divided by 7. 27 divided by 7 gives us a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 6. 4. Now we have the expression (6)^2 to consider for the remainder when divided by 7. (6)^2 = 36 When 36 is divided by 7, the quotient is 5 with a remainder of 1.

Since the LCM has 3^2 and the highest power of 3 in 24 and 42 is 3^1, the second number must contribute the extra 3 to make it 3^2. Therefore, the second number must have at least 3 as a prime factor to contribute to the LCM. However, since the LCM is 504 and we already have an LCM of 168 with just 24 and 42, the second number must also have a factor that, when multiplied with 168, gives 504. To find this factor, we divide 504 by 168: 504 / 168 = 3 This means the second number must have a factor of 3 to contribute to the LCM of 504. Since we already accounted for the prime factors in 24 and 42, the second number must be a multiple of 3 that does not introduce any new prime factors that would increase the LCM beyond 504. Therefore, the second number is boxed{3} ."},{"prompt":"Given the sequence ( x, y, z, w ) satisfying ( xy + 2yz + zw leq A(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2) ), find the minimum value of the real number ( A ).","completion":"1. **Problem Rewriting and Inequality Setup**: Given the sequences x, y, z, w, we are asked to find the minimum value of A such that the inequality [ xy + 2yz + zw leq A left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2right) ] holds. 2. **Using the AM-GM Inequality Approach**: To handle the terms individually, we apply the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) Inequality. Consider: [ 2xy leq lambda x^2 + frac{1}{lambda} y^2 ] for some lambda > 0. Similarly, for 2yz and 2zw: [ 2yz leq y^2 + z^2, ] and [ 2zw leq mu z^2 + frac{1}{mu} w^2 ] for some mu > 0. 3. **Summing the Terms**: Adding all the inequalities together: [ xy + 2yz + zw leq frac{lambda}{2} x^2 + left(frac{1}{2lambda} + 1 right) y^2 + left(1 + frac{mu}{2}right) z^2 + frac{1}{2mu} w^2. ] 4. **Matching Coefficients**: To match the left-hand side terms with the right-hand side terms appropriately to find A, equate the coefficients in: [ A left(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 right) geq frac{lambda}{2} x^2 + left(frac{1}{2lambda} + 1 right) y^2 + left(1 + frac{mu}{2}right) z^2 + frac{1}{2mu} w^2. ] 5. **Solving for Parameters**: From here we get: [ frac{lambda}{2} = A, ] [ frac{1}{2lambda} + 1 = A, ] [ 1 + frac{mu}{2} = A, ] [ frac{1}{2mu} = A. ] 6. **Finding lambda and mu**: Solving for lambda: [ frac{lambda}{2} = A quad text{and} quad frac{1}{2lambda} + 1 = A ] gives us: [ frac{lambda}{2} = frac{1}{lambda} + 2A - 1. ] Simplifying: [ lambda^2 = 2left(1 + A -A right), ] getting: [ lambda^2 = sqrt{2}+1 Rightarrow lambda = sqrt{2}+1. ] Solving for mu similarly: [ 1 + frac{mu}{2} = A quad text{and} quad frac{1}{2mu} = A ] gives us: [ mu^2 = sqrt{frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{2}-1 Rightarrow mu = sqrt{2}-1. ] 7. **Conclusion**: Substituting lambda and mu back into the inequalities confirms the minimum A: [ A = frac{1+sqrt{2}}{2}. ] Therefore, the minimum value of A is [ boxed{frac{1+sqrt{2}}{2}}. ]"},{"prompt":"The foci of ellipse C are F_{1}(sqrt{2},0) and F_{2}(sqrt{2},0), and the point M(sqrt{2},1) is on the ellipse C.

(I) Find the standard equation of ellipse C; (II) Prove that line AD always passes through a fixed point, and find the coordinates of that point.","completion":"Solution: (I) Method 1 Let the standard equation of ellipse C be frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > b > 0). From the given information, we have begin{cases} a^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2} frac{2}{a^{2}} + frac{1}{b^{2}} = 1 c = sqrt{2} end{cases}, solving this system yields begin{cases} a = 2 b = sqrt{2} end{cases}. Therefore, the equation of ellipse C is frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{2} = 1. Method 2 Let the standard equation of ellipse c be frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > b > 0). From the given information, we have c = sqrt{2}, 2a = |MF_{1}| + |MF_{2}| = sqrt{[sqrt{2} - (-sqrt{2})]^{2} + 1} + 1 = 4. Thus, a = 2, b^{2} = a^{2} - c^{2} = 2. Therefore, the equation of ellipse c is frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{2} = 1. (II) Method 1 When the slope of line l exists (as per the problem statement k neq 0), let the equation of line l be y = kx + 1. From begin{cases} frac{x^{2}}{4} + frac{y^{2}}{2} = 1 y = kx + 1 end{cases}, we get (2k^{2} + 1)x^{2} + 4kx - 2 = 0. Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}). Then, begin{cases} Delta = 16k^{2} + 8(2k^{2} + 1) > 0 x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{4k}{2k^{2} + 1} x_{1}x_{2} = -frac{2}{2k^{2} + 1} end{cases}. Specifically, when A is (2,0), k = -frac{1}{2}, thus 2x_{2} = -frac{4}{3}, x_{2} = -frac{2}{3}, y_{2} = frac{4}{3}, i.e., B(-frac{2}{3}, frac{4}{3}). Therefore, the symmetric point of B with respect to the y-axis is D(frac{2}{3}, frac{4}{3}), then the equation of line AD is y = -x + 2. Also, when the slope of line l does not exist, the equation of line AD is x = 0, If there exists a fixed point Q satisfying the conditions, then Q(0,2). Thus, K_{QA} = frac{y_{1} - 2}{x_{1}} = frac{y_{1} - 1 - 1}{x_{1}} = k - frac{1}{x_{1}}, K_{QB} = frac{y_{2} - 2}{-x_{2}} = -k + frac{1}{x_{2}}, Since k_{QA} - k_{QB} = 2k - (frac{1}{x_{1}} + frac{1}{x_{2}}) = 2k - (frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{x_{1}x_{2}}) = 2k - 2k = 0, Thus, K_{QA} = K_{QB}, i.e., points A, D, Q are collinear. Hence, line AD always passes through a fixed point, and the coordinates of that point are Q(0,2). Method 2 (II)① When the slope of line l exists (as per the problem statement k neq 0), let the equation of line l be y = kx + 1. From begin{cases} overset{y=kx+1}{x^{2}+2y^{2}=4} end{cases}, we get (1+2k^{2})x^{2}+4kx-2=0. Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), B(x_{2},y_{2}), then D(-x_{2},y_{2}). Thus, begin{cases} Delta = 16k^{2} + 8(2k^{2} + 1) > 0 x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{4k}{2k^{2} + 1} x_{1}x_{2} = -frac{2}{2k^{2} + 1} end{cases}. Since k_{AD} = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}}, The equation of line AD is: y - y_{1} = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}}(x - x_{1}). Thus, y = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}} cdot x + frac{x_{1}y_{2} - x_{1}y_{1}}{x_{2} + x_{1}} + y_{1}, = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}} cdot x + frac{x_{1}y_{2} - x_{1}y_{1} + x_{2}y_{1} + x_{1}y_{1}}{x_{2} + x_{1}}, = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}} cdot x + frac{x_{1}y_{2} + x_{2}y_{1}}{x_{2} + x_{1}}, = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}} cdot x + frac{x_{1}(kx_{2} + 1) + x_{2}(kx_{1} + 1)}{x_{2} + x_{1}}, = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}} cdot x + frac{2kx_{1}x_{2} + x_{2} + x_{1}}{x_{2} + x_{1}}, = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}} cdot x + frac{2kx_{1}x_{2}}{x_{2} + x_{1}} + 1, = frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{-x_{2} - x_{1}} cdot x + 2. Since when x = 0, y = 2, Thus, line MD always passes through the point (0,2). ② When k does not exist, the equation of line AD is x = 0, passing through the fixed point (0,2). In summary, line AD always passes through a fixed point, and the coordinates of that point are (0,2).

When all three pipes are open, the net rate at which the tank is being emptied is the sum of the rates of the outlet pipes minus the rate of the inlet pipe: Net emptying rate = (6 + x) cubic inches/min - 3 cubic inches/min Net emptying rate = x + 3 cubic inches/min We know that it takes 3456 minutes to empty the tank when all three pipes are open, so we can set up the following equation: Volume of tank / Net emptying rate = Time to empty tank 51840 cubic inches / (x + 3) cubic inches/min = 3456 minutes Now, we can solve for x: 51840 cubic inches = (x + 3) cubic inches/min * 3456 minutes 51840 cubic inches = 3456x + 10368 cubic inches Subtract 10368 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 51840 cubic inches - 10368 cubic inches = 3456x 41472 cubic inches = 3456x Now, divide both sides by 3456 to solve for x: x = 41472 cubic inches / 3456 minutes x = 12 cubic inches/min So, the rate at which the other outlet pipe empties the tank is boxed{12} cubic inches/min."},{"prompt":"Which of the following equations is a quadratic equation?

Now, when the same number N is divided by 67, the remainder is 1. This can be expressed as: N = 67 * Q' + 1 where Q' is the quotient in the second division (which we don't need to find). Since N is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions: 68 * Q = 67 * Q' + 1 Now, we know that N is a multiple of 68, so it must be one more than a multiple of 67 (because when divided by 67, the remainder is 1). The smallest number that satisfies this condition is 68 itself (since 68 divided by 67 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1).

The formula for the number of combinations of n items taken 2 at a time (which is the case for handshakes between two boys) is: nC2 = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!)

Examining the general term in the series, we have: frac{1}{2^{2002}} cdot 3^r cdot C_{2002}^{2r}. This can be expressed as: C_{2002}^{2r} left(frac{1}{2}right)^{2002-2r} left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^{2r}. 3. Next, observe that the term can be rewritten in a form involving a complex number raised to a power. Notice that: left(frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} iright) = e^{i pi/3}. 4. The above observation implies: left(frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} iright)^{2002}. Applying De Moivre's Theorem, we get: left(e^{i pi / 3}right)^{2002} = e^{i cdot 2002 cdot pi / 3}. 5.

Here is a step-by-step method: 1. **Understand the given points**: We have a point P inside a circle and a given line segment of length l. We want to draw a chord through P that is equal in length to the given line segment l. 2. **Identify geometric properties**: The set of all points that are midpoints of chords of length l in a given circle forms a concentric circle. This concentric circle's radius can be determined from the properties of a right triangle formed within the original circle. 3. **Construct the right triangle**: Consider a right triangle where: - The hypotenuse is equal to the radius R of the given circle. - One leg (half the chord length) is equal to frac{l}{2}. We use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other leg, which will turn out to be the radius of the concentric circle. 4. **Compute the radius of the concentric circle**: Using the Pythagorean theorem: [ R^2 = left(frac{l}{2}right)^2 + r^2 ] where R is the radius of the original circle, l is the given segment length, and r is the radius of the concentric circle (which is the required leg length). Solving for r: [ r^2 = R^2 - left(frac{l}{2}right)^2 ] [ r = sqrt{R^2 - left(frac{l}{2}right)^2} ] 5. **Draw the concentric circle**: Using P as the center, draw a circle with the radius r. This is the geometric locus of the required midpoints. 6. **Construct the tangent**: Through the given point P, draw a tangent to the newly constructed circle. There are at most two tangents that can be drawn from P. 7. **Identify the chord**: The intersection points of these tangents with the original circle form the endpoints of the chord. The segment of these tangents included within the circle forms our required chord of length l. 8. **Complete the construction**: Ensure the chord is correctly formed by measuring its length to confirm it equals l. Conclusion: By using properties of circles and right triangles, we can construct the desired chord through a specified point within the circle such that it matches the length of a given segment.

What is the ratio of the number of eggs Ked needs per week to the number of eggs Ben needs per week?","completion":"Let's first calculate the total number of eggs needed by Saly and Ben per week: Saly needs 10 eggs per week. Ben needs 14 eggs per week. Together, they need 10 + 14 = 24 eggs per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of eggs needed by Saly and Ben in a month is: 24 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 96 eggs/month. Now, we know that Mcdonald's farm should produce 124 eggs in a month. If Saly and Ben need 96 eggs in total for the month, we can find out how many eggs are needed for Ked by subtracting the total needed by Saly and Ben from the total production: 124 eggs (total production) - 96 eggs (Saly and Ben) = 28 eggs for Ked in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can find out how many eggs Ked needs per week by dividing the monthly amount by 4: 28 eggs/month / 4 weeks/month = 7 eggs/week for Ked. Now, we can find the ratio of the number of eggs Ked needs per week to the number of eggs Ben needs per week: Ked needs 7 eggs/week. Ben needs 14 eggs/week. The ratio is 7 (Ked) to 14 (Ben), which can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 7: 7/14 = 1/2.

Also, let (K) and (L) be the vertices of the squares on sides (CD) and (DA) opposite (C) and (A), respectively. 2. **Identifying the key sections to analyze:** Define the midpoints of the segments (AC, HF, EG,) and (BD) as (F_1, F_2, F_3,) and (F_4) respectively. We aim to show that the quadrilateral (F_1 F_2 F_3 F_4) forms a square. 3. **Rotating triangles and establishing perpendicularity and equal lengths:** - When the triangle (LCD) is rotated around point (D) by (90^circ) in the positive (counterclockwise) direction, it maps to the triangle (ADK). Therefore, (AK) is perpendicular to (LC) and they have equal lengths. - Thus, segment (F_1G) (middle of (AK)) and segment (HF_1) (middle of (LC)) are both equal in length and perpendicular to each other as they represent the midlines of triangles (AKC) and (LCA) respectively. 4. **Analyzing other segments and their relationships:** - Similarly, segment (F_1E) and segment (F_1F) are found to be equal in length and mutually perpendicular. - This implies that triangle (G F_1 E), when rotated (90^circ) around (F_1) in the positive direction, maps exactly onto triangle (H F_1 F). 5. **Using symmetry and rotation principles:** - The medians (centroid lines) from point (F_1) to the vertices of triangles (F_1G E) and (H F_1 F) are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, segment (F_1 F_3) is perpendicular to segment (F_1 F_2) and they are the same length. - Applying the same reasoning consitently to all pairs, the midpoints (F_4 F_2) and (F_4 F_3) must also be perpendicular and equal in length, confirming the properties of a square. 6. **Conclusion:** - From the above logical steps, it follows that quadrilateral (F_1 F_2 F_3 F_4) is indeed a square.

The orthic triangle here is A_1 B_1 C_1 = T where: - A_1 lies on CB, with MA_1 perp CB passes through A. - B_1 lies on BM, with CB_1 perp BM passes through A. - B_1 lies on MC, with BC_1 perp MC passes through A. 3. **Verification for Other Potential Triangles:** Similarly, triangles BAM and CMA (denoted as H_2 and H_3 respectively) will have T as their orthic triangles, with their orthocenters being C and B respectively. Furthermore, H_2 and H_3 will have angles greater than 90^circ at these vertices. 4. **General Case Consideration:** In a general setting, if a triangle is not a right triangle, its three altitudes and three sides bisect its orthic triangle’s interior or exterior angles. 5. **Uniqueness of the Four Triangles:** The sides of the triangles that have T as their orthic triangle must be among the angle bisectors of T’s internal and external angles. These angle bisectors intersect at four points (the centers of the incircle and three excircles), restricting the choice of triangle vertices ABC, BAM, MCA, and the triangle limitation to only these combinations which we've already demonstrated. 6. **Conclusion for Part a:** Thus, it is shown that the only triangles with T as their orthic triangles are the four distinct triangles as described. blacksquare 7. **Computing the Angles of the Given Triangle:** - For the given triangle T with angles angle T = 24^circ, 60^circ, 96^circ, we compute the angles for H_1, H_2, H_3. 8. **Formulas from Reference for General Heady Triangles:** Use transformations: - alpha' = 180^circ - 2alpha, beta' = 180^circ - 2beta, gamma' = 180^circ - 2gamma - Given alpha > 90^circ, then the transformations: - alpha' = 2alpha - 180^circ, beta' = 2beta, gamma' = 2gamma 9. **Solving Equations for Given Angles:** - Equating given angles: [ 180^circ - 2alpha = 24^circ, quad 180^circ - 2beta = 60^circ, quad 180^circ - 2gamma = 96^circ ] - Solving these gives: [ alpha = 78^circ, quad beta = 60^circ, quad gamma = 42^circ ] - Alternatively, solving using alpha > 90^circ: [ 2alpha - 180^circ = 24^circ, quad 2beta = 60^circ, quad 2gamma = 96^circ ] - Gives: [ alpha=102^circ, quad beta=30^circ, quad gamma=48^circ ] 10. **Conclusion verifying consistency and completeness:** All possible consistent value sets do result in triangle angles summing to 180^circ per valid geometric constraint: [ 270^circ - frac{alpha' + beta' + gamma'}{2} text {and} quad 90^circ + frac{alpha' + beta' + gamma'}{2} ] Therefore, the problem statement and all calculations are verified correct.

Given a_{1}=1, we have a_{2}= frac {4}{19}, a_{3}= frac {76}{301}, and 0 < a_{n}leqslant 1. We will now use mathematical induction to prove that 0 < a_{2n} < frac {1}{4} < a_{2n-1}leqslant 1.

So, frac {a_{n}- frac {1}{4}}{a_{n}+4}= frac {3}{20}cdot (- frac {1}{4})^{n-1}. Since a_{n} > 0, when n is odd, a_{n} > frac {1}{4}; when n is even, a_{n} < frac {1}{4}. Hence, there exists c= frac {1}{4} such that a_{2n} < frac {1}{4} < a_{2n-1}. (III) Proof: From (II), we have frac {4}{19}leqslant a_{2n} < frac {1}{4} < a_{2n-1}leqslant 1, which leads to a_{1}+a_{2}+…+a_{n}leqslant n.

As b_{1}= frac {3}{4},b_{2}=- frac {3}{76},b_{3}= frac {3}{1204}, the inequality b_{1}+b_{2}+…+b_{n} > 0 holds for n=1, 2, 3, and the left-side inequality holds.

This group contains all integers from 1 to p-1 that are coprime to p. The group is denoted as ((G, times) = left(left(mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z}right)^*, timesright)). 3. **Order of the Group:** Since p is a prime number, every integer 1, 2, ldots, p-1 is coprime to p. Thus, the order of this group, i.e., the number of elements in the group, is |left(mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z}right)^*| = p-1. 4. **Order of an Element:** Let n be the order of the element a in the group G. Recall that the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer n such that a^n equiv 1 pmod{p}. 5. **Divisibility Argument:** Since a in G, we know that a has finite order n.

Since all distances between cities are distinct, for every mayor ( M ), there exists a unique mayor ( M' neq M ) such that ( d(M, M') ) is minimized, i.e., [ i(M) = min{d(M, N) : N neq M}. ] 3. **Mayor Travel Interpretation**: If two mayors ( M ) and ( M' ) have ( i(M) = d(M, M') ) and ( i(M') = d(M', M) ), then ( M ) travels to ( M' )'s city and vice versa.

Since ( n ) is odd, not all cities can be paired off into exchanges. 6. **Existence of a Non-Exchanging Mayor**: Therefore, there exists at least one mayor ( M ) who does not engage in an exchange. Let this mayor be ( M ) and also assume that ( i(M) ) is the largest possible distance traveled among all mayors who did not exchange. 7. **Implication for Other Mayors**: Since ( M ) has not exchanged, no other mayor could have visited mayor ( M )'s city because: - If they did an exchange, it could not involve ( M ). - If any other mayor ( M' ) traveled to ( M )'s city, then ( i(M) leq i(M') ), which contradicts the maximality of ( i(M) ). 8. **Non-Visited City**: Because mayor ( M ) visited another city and no other mayor visited ( M )'s city, this leads to a contradiction in the total count: all other cities must then be visited twice to maintain the tally of cities visited. This means there must be some city that was visited by at least two different mayors. # Conclusion: Hence, we conclude that since not all mayors can engage in exchanges due to ( n ) being odd, and there exists at least one city not visited, it is inevitable that at least one city has been visited by two mayors.

Therefore, the total number of female participants is twice the number of female democrats: F = 2 * 135 F = 270 Now we can find the number of male participants by subtracting the number of female participants from the total number of participants: M = 810 - F M = 810 - 270 M = 540 We are also told that one-quarter of the male participants are democrats. So the number of male democrats is: Male Democrats = 1/4 * M Male Democrats = 1/4 * 540 Male Democrats = 135 Now we can find the total number of democrats by adding the number of female democrats and male democrats: Total Democrats = Female Democrats + Male Democrats Total Democrats = 135 + 135 Total Democrats = 270 Finally, we can find the ratio of democrats to the total number of participants: Ratio = Total Democrats / Total Participants Ratio = 270 / 810 Ratio = 1 / 3 So the ratio of democrats to the total number of participants is boxed{1:3} ."},{"prompt":"The pie chart shows a percentage breakdown of 1000 votes in a student election.

This is because both 2x^2e^{2x} and ln(x) are increasing functions for x > 0. 3. From the equation 2x^2e^{2x} + ln(x) = 0, we can rearrange terms to get 2x^2e^{2x} = -ln(x).

Since f(2x) = f(-ln(x)), and given that f'(x) = (x + 1)e^x > 0 for all x, f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). Therefore, the only way f(2x_0) = f(-ln(x_0)) is if 2x_0 = -ln(x_0), which simplifies to 2x_0 + ln(x_0) = 0. This confirms that statement C is correct. 6.

Applying L'Hôpital's Rule since the form is ( frac{0}{0} ): [ lim_{x rightarrow 0} f(x) = lim_{x rightarrow 0} frac{frac{A}{1 + A x}}{frac{1}{1 + x}} = lim_{x rightarrow 0} frac{A(1+x)}{1+A x} = A ] 19.

Relative speed = 30.56 m/s + 36.11 m/s = 66.67 m/s (approximately) The total distance that needs to be covered for the trains to meet is the sum of the distance between them and their lengths. Total distance = Distance between the trains + Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 850 meters + 150 meters + 250 meters = 1250 meters Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to meet by dividing the total distance by the relative speed.

Let the prime be ( p ). Then we have ( p = a + b ) and ( p = c - d ), where ( a ), ( b ), ( c ), and ( d ) are also primes. Without loss of generality, assume ( a > b ). 2. First, consider the case ( p = 2 ). If ( p = 2 ), then ( 2 = a + b ) and ( 2 = c - d ). Since 2 is the only even prime, both ( a ) and ( b ) must be primes that sum to 2. The only such pair is ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 0 ), but 0 is not a prime number. Therefore, ( p neq 2 ). 3. Since ( p ) is not 2, ( p ) must be an odd prime. For ( a + b ) to be odd, one of ( a ) or ( b ) must be even, and the other must be odd. The only even prime is 2, so without loss of generality, let ( b = 2 ). Thus, ( p = a + 2 ). 4. Similarly, for ( c - d ) to be odd, one of ( c ) or ( d ) must be even, and the other must be odd. The only even prime is 2, so without loss of generality, let ( c = 2 ). Thus, ( p = 2 - d ). 5. Now we have the equations: [ p = a + 2 ] [ p = 2 - d ] 6. Equating the two expressions for ( p ), we get: [ a + 2 = 2 - d ] [ a + d = 0 ] Since ( a ) and ( d ) are primes, the only solution to this equation is ( a = 0 ) and ( d = 0 ), but 0 is not a prime number. Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach. 7. Instead, consider the condition ( p = a + 2 ) and ( p = d - 2 ). This implies: [ a + 2 = d - 2 ] [ d = a + 4 ] 8. Since ( a ), ( p ), and ( d ) are all primes, and they form three consecutive odd numbers, one of them must be a multiple of 3 (since every third odd number is a multiple of 3). 9. The only set of three consecutive odd primes where one is a multiple of 3 is ( 3, 5, 7 ). Here, ( a = 3 ), ( p = 5 ), and ( d = 7 ). 10.

The original square has a side of 8 cm, so its length and breadth are both 8 cm. The rectangle that is combined with the square has a length of 8 cm and a breadth of 4 cm. When the square and the rectangle are combined, the length of the new rectangle will be the sum of the lengths of the square and the rectangle, since they share a common side of 8 cm. The breadth of the new rectangle will be the same as the breadth of the square, which is 8 cm, because the breadth of the rectangle (4 cm) is not adding to the breadth of the square. So, the length of the new rectangle is 8 cm (from the square) + 8 cm (from the rectangle) = 16 cm. The breadth of the new rectangle is 8 cm.

Then ( P'A = P'P = a ) and ( P'C = b ). Let ( theta = angle PP'C ). Since ( angle AP'C = 60^circ + angle PP'C ), we can use the Law of Cosines on ( triangle AP'C ): [ s^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(theta + 60^circ) ] 3. Using the angle addition formula for cosine, we have: [ cos(theta + 60^circ) = cos theta cos 60^circ - sin theta sin 60^circ = frac{1}{2} cos theta - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin theta ] 4. Substituting this into the Law of Cosines equation: [ s^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab left( frac{1}{2} cos theta - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin theta right) ] 5.

Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots ( a + b + c = 18 ) and the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time ( ab + bc + ca = 91 ).

The total time taken for the whole journey is the sum of the time taken to travel from x to y and the time taken to travel from y to x: Total Time = (D / 43) + (D / 34) hours Now, the average speed for the entire journey is the total distance divided by the total time: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time Substituting the values we have: Average Speed = 2D / [(D / 43) + (D / 34)] To simplify, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the product of the two speeds (43 * 34) to get rid of the fractions: Average Speed = (2D * 43 * 34) / [(D * 34) + (D * 43)] Since D is common in both the numerator and denominator, it cancels out: Average Speed = (2 * 43 * 34) / (34 + 43) Now we can calculate the average speed: Average Speed = (2 * 43 * 34) / (77) Average Speed = (2924) / (77) Average Speed = 38 km/hr So, Ganesh's average speed during the whole journey is boxed{38} km/hr."},{"prompt":"The range of the function y=( frac {1}{2})^{x^{2}2} is ______.","completion":"Let t=x^{2}-2geqslant -2, Since y=( frac {1}{2})^{t} is a decreasing function, Hence 0 < ( frac {1}{2})^{t}leqslant ( frac {1}{2})^{-2}=4, Thus, the range of the function y=( frac {1}{2})^{x^{2}-2} is (0,4], Therefore, the answer is boxed{(0,4]}.

Let the decimal parts of frac{a}{b} and frac{c}{d} be represented as A overline{B} and C overline{D} respectively, where A, B, C, D are strings composed of digits from the set {0, 1, dots, 9}. 2. Assume that B and D have the smallest possible periods, denoted as m and n respectively, and that A and C have the shortest possible lengths for those periods (i.e., the last character of A (or C) cannot be merged into the periodic part overline{B} (or overline{D})). 3. Consider the string B^{|C| + |D|}. Since every finite block of digits in frac{a}{b} appears in frac{c}{d}, B^{|C| + |D|} must appear in C overline{D} as well. 4. Since the suffix B^{|D|} cannot intersect with C due to |B| cdot |C| geq |C|, it follows that B^{|D|} can be found in D^{infty}. This implies that for some cyclic shift D' of D, we have D'^{|B|} = B^{|D'|}, forcing B and D to be cyclic shifts of each other and to have the same period, i.e., |B| = |D|. 5. Replace C with a slightly larger string if necessary, and assume D = B. Thus, every finite substring from A overline{B} is found in C overline{B}. 6. Define k = |C| and n = |B| for ease of notation. We aim to show that A is a suffix of C. If A is empty, we are done. Assume |C| > 0 by adding a D if necessary. 7. Consider the strings AB^i for positive integers i. Suppose the i-th such string is found in C overline{B} from the x_i-th position onward. Claim: We have x_i > k for finitely many i. Proof: - Assume otherwise, i.e., x_i > k for infinitely many i. This implies that AB^i exists in B^{infty} for infinitely many i. Some i bmod n repeats infinitely often. Fix such a residue r and note that due to periodicity, it follows that AB_1B_2 dots B_r B^{infty} exists in B^{infty}. This implies that A completely extends into B, which is a contradiction. - Therefore, x_i in {1, 2, dots, k} for large enough i. Hence, some x_i repeats infinitely often. Fix such an x_i and observe that this implies A agrees with C_{x_i}C_{x_i+1} dots C_k B_1 B_2 dots B_u for some positive integer u. Since infinitely many i are obtained by extending this very string, it follows that u = 0, otherwise B would have a smaller period, or A could be introduced into it. This shows that A is a suffix of C. 8. Let ell = |C| - |A| and note that frac{a}{b} - frac{10^{ell}c}{d} is an integer, implying b mid d.

Let's analyze the set (S = {1, 2, cdots, 2005}). We are given a subset (A subseteq S) such that the sum of any two elements in (A) is not divisible by 117. We need to determine the maximum possible size of (A). 2. First, we partition the set (S) based on the residue classes modulo 117. Define (F_i = {x in S ;|; x equiv i pmod{117}}). Therefore, [ S = bigcup_{i=0}^{116} F_i ] 3. Now, we count the elements in each (F_i): - For (i = 0): The elements in (F_0) are ({0, 117, 234, ldots, 1872}).

Since the solution set of the inequality is (-infty, -1) cup (2, infty), it means the quadratic has two distinct real roots, x_1 = -1 and x_2 = 2. Therefore, the quadratic can be expressed as: a(x + 1)(x - 2) < 0 2. When we expand the expression a(x + 1)(x - 2), we get: ax^2 - 2a + ax - 2a = ax^2 + (a - 2a)x + (2a - 2a) ax^2 - a(x) - 2a Based on the original equation ax^2+(a-1)x+(a-2), we need to have: a - 1 = -a implies a = frac{1}{2} a - 2 = -2a implies a = frac{2}{3} Neither of these values for a can be true simultaneously based on the expansion, therefore there must be a mistake in this approach. Instead, we need to use the fact that x_1 = -1 and x_2 = 2 are roots to find the correct value of a. 3. Given that x_1 = -1 and x_2 = 2 are the roots of the quadratic equation, by Vieta's formulas, we know: x_1 + x_2 = -frac{(a - 1)}{a} (-1) + 2 = 1 = -frac{(a - 1)}{a} Solving for a, we get: a - 1 = -a 2a = 1 a = frac{1}{2} 4. However, substituting a = frac{1}{2} back to the original inequality would not yield the desired solution set. Therefore, instead, we must consider the condition for the parabola to be open upwards (as the solution set is unbounded for large x values). Since the inequality has solutions for x < -1 and x > 2, the coefficient a of the x^2 term must be positive. 5. Also, since the inequality is strict (<), the quadratic must not be equal to zero at x = -1 and x = 2. This means that neither of these points are roots of the equation f(x) = 0. However, this contradicts the original approach of writing the quadratic as a(x+1)(x-2), which would imply that x = -1 and x = 2 are roots of the equation. Hence, we cannot express the quadratic directly as a product of linear factors as done in step 1. Instead, we should refer to the discriminant of the quadratic which is implied by the solution set (-infty, -1) cup (2, infty): 6. For a quadratic function with two real roots, the discriminant Delta should be positive, i.e., Delta = (a-1)^2 - 4a(a-2) > 0. We can simplify this inequality. begin{align*} Delta &= (a-1)^2 - 4a(a-2) &= a^2 - 2a + 1 - 4a^2 + 8a &= -3a^2 + 6a + 1 > 0 end{align*} 7. Since a > 0, we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of a for which the inequality holds true. Solving -3a^2 + 6a + 1 = 0, we get: a = frac{-6 pm sqrt{6^2 - 4(-3)(1)}}{2(-3)} a = frac{-6 pm sqrt{36 + 12}}{-6} a = frac{-6 pm sqrt{48}}{-6} We only consider the positive sign because a is positive and hence the discriminant needs to be positive as well: a = frac{-6 + 4sqrt{3}}{-6} a = 1 - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} 8. However, upon reviewing the conditions set by the solution set, we know that the value of a must also satisfy the inequality for the function to be less than zero outside the interval [-1, 2]. The correct approach is to consider the parabola's axis of symmetry, which is given by x = -frac{b}{2a} = -frac{(a-1)}{2a}. For the parabola to be downward-facing and have the solution set outside the roots, the axis of symmetry must be between the roots, i.e. -1 < -frac{(a-1)}{2a} < 2, which simplifies to -2a < (a-1) < 4a Also, we know that the y-coordinates for the points x=-1 and x=2 must be greater than or equal to zero (as they are outside the range where the original inequality is less than zero). Substituting x = -1 into the inequality, we get: a(-1)^2 + (a-1)(-1) + (a-2) geq 0 a - (a - 1) + (a - 2) geq 0 3a - 3 geq 0 a geq 1 Similarly, substituting x = 2 into the inequality, we derive: a(2)^2 + (a-1)(2) + (a-2) geq 0 4a + 2a - 2 + a - 2 geq 0 7a - 4 geq 0 a geq frac{4}{7} Taking into account that a needs to be positive and satisfy both conditions, the only value that matches is a geq 1.

Consider MN to be one of the edges of the tetrahedron and L the point of tangency where the semiscribed sphere touches the edge MN. 4. Since OL is perpendicular to MN, we have two right triangles triangle OLM and triangle OLN formed. 5. By the Pythagorean theorem, for both right triangles, we have: [ mathrm{OL}^2 + mathrm{LM}^2 = mathrm{OM}^2 ] Since mathrm{OL} is the radius r, and mathrm{OM} is the radius mathrm{R}, we plug in these values: [ r^2 + mathrm{LM}^2 = mathrm{R}^2 ] 6. Similarly, we have: [ r^2 + mathrm{LN}^2 = mathrm{R}^2 ] 7. From the two equations above, we conclude mathrm{LM} = mathrm{LN}, so the distance from the center to the point of tangency divides the edge MN into two equal segments. 8. This implies that mathrm{ML} = mathrm{NL}. Denote this length by x, so: [ mathrm{ML} = mathrm{NL} = x ] 9. Since MN = mathrm{ML} + mathrm{LN}, we have: [ MN = x + x = 2x ] 10.

To simplify this, we consider the binomial expansion of ((sqrt{5} + 2)^p) and ((sqrt{5} - 2)^p). 2. **Using Conjugates**: Let (a_p = (sqrt{5} + 2)^p + (sqrt{5} - 2)^p). Notice that ((sqrt{5} - 2)^p) is very small because (|sqrt{5} - 2| < 1) and (p) is an odd prime, making ((sqrt{5} - 2)^p) close to zero. Therefore, (a_p) is approximately ((sqrt{5} + 2)^p). 3. **Sequence Definition**: Define the sequence (a_n = (2 + sqrt{5})^n + (2 - sqrt{5})^n). This sequence satisfies the recurrence relation: [ a_{n+2} = 4a_{n+1} - a_n ] with initial conditions (a_0 = 2) and (a_1 = 4). 4. **Simplifying the Expression**: We need to show that (a_p - 2^{p+1}) is divisible by (20p). First, note that: [ a_p = (2 + sqrt{5})^p + (2 - sqrt{5})^p ] Since ((2 - sqrt{5})^p) is very small, we approximate: [ a_p approx (2 + sqrt{5})^p ] 5. **Modulo 20**: We need to show that (a_p - 2^{p+1}) is divisible by 20. We start by examining the sequence modulo 20. For odd (p), we have: [ a_p = 2 sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2} binom{p}{2k} 5^k 2^{p-2k} ] Each term in the sum is divisible by (p) because (binom{p}{2k}) is divisible by (p) for (k geq 1). 6. **Divisibility by (p)**: Since (a_p) is a sum of terms each divisible by (p), it follows that (a_p) itself is divisible by (p). 7. **Combining Results**: Since (a_p) is divisible by both 20 and (p), it follows that (a_p - 2^{p+1}) is divisible by (20p).

There are 100 unique numbers in this range. 3. **Product in Rows and Columns**: - Each row in the (10 times 10) table consists of 10 consecutive numbers, leading to 10 different products for 10 rows. - Similarly, each column consists of 10 numbers (incremented by 10 each time), giving 10 different products for 10 columns. 4. **Prime Factorization Considerations**: - To check whether the sets of products can be the same for rows and columns, consider the prime factorization of these numbers. - We note that prime numbers are crucial in factorization because they are irreducible. 5. **Prime Number List**: - List the last 11 prime numbers less than or equal to 202: [ 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199 ] - Each of these prime numbers can appear in the prime factorization exactly once among the numbers from 103 to 202 as their multiples outside this range do not exist below or above this range. 6. **Applying the Principle of Dirichlet (Pigeonhole principle)**: - Each product in a row or a column can strictly have unique sets of prime factors less than or equal to 202. - By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one row in the table containing products that share two or more of these prime factors. 7. **Contradiction from Overlapping Factors**: - Suppose row ( x ) contains a product with prime factors ( m ) and ( n ). These factors must lie in different columns. - Thus, the column products containing ( m ) and ( n ) will not overlap in containing the exact same prime factors as any specific row's product. - Therefore, it is impossible for rows' product set to be identical to columns' product set as any product in the row will contain primes that distribute differently across multiple columns. 8. **Conclusion**: - The sets of 10 products in rows cannot be identical to the set of 10 products in columns due to inconsistencies in the presence and distribution of prime factors.

This implies x^{2}-6x+9geqslant 6-6m, or (x-3)^{2}geqslant 6-6m. - Case 1: When mgeqslant 1, 6-6mleqslant 0. Since x > m, (x-3)^{2}geqslant 0, this condition always holds. - Case 2: When m < 1, x=3 leads to 6m-6geqslant 0, which gives mgeqslant 1 (this case can be discarded).

This means that for every 1 part of flavoring, there are 12 parts of corn syrup and 30 parts of water. In the sport formulation, the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is three times as great. So if the standard ratio is ( 1 : 12 ), the sport formulation ratio for flavoring to corn syrup would be ( 3 : 12 ), which simplifies to ( 1 : 4 ).

The graph of f(x) is symmetric about the line x = -frac{pi}{36}, and one zero of f(x) is at x = frac{7}{72}pi. We want to find the minimum value of omega. First, we recognize the symmetry property which implies: -omegacdotleft(-frac{pi}{36}right)+varphi = frac{pi}{2} + npi, where n in mathbb{Z}. Simplifying this, we get: varphi =left(frac{1}{2}+frac{omega}{36}+nright)pi, quad nin mathbb{Z}.

Determine the minimum value of n and explain the reason.","completion":"**Solution**: First, we prove that when n leq 14, the property described in the problem does not hold. When N=14, for the 14 consecutive integers from 9999993 to 10000006, the sum of digits of any number is not divisible by 8. Therefore, when n leq 14, the property described in the problem does not hold. Thus, for the property to hold, we must have n geq 15. Next, we prove that when n=15, the property holds. Let a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{15} be any 15 consecutive positive integers. Among these 15 integers, the number of integers with a units digit of 0 is at most two and at least one. We can divide it into: (1) When there are two integers among a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{15} whose units digit is 0, Let a_i < a_j, and the units digits of a_i and a_j are 0. Then, a_i, a_i+1, ldots, a_i+9, a_j are 11 consecutive integers, where a_i, a_i+1, ldots, a_i+9, a_j have no carry-over in their addition. Let n_i represent the sum of digits of a_i. Then, the sum of digits of the first 10 numbers are n_i, n_i+1, ldots, n_i+9 respectively. Thus, among these 10 consecutive numbers, at least one is divisible by 8. (2) When there is one integer among a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{15} whose units digit is 0 (denoted as a_i), ① If the integer i satisfies 1 leq i leq 8, then there are at least 7 consecutive integers after a_i. Thus, a_i, a_i+1, ldots, a_i+7 are 8 consecutive integers whose sum of digits are also 8 consecutive numbers, so there must be one number that is divisible by 8. ② If the integer i satisfies 9 leq i leq 15, then there are at least 8 consecutive integers before a_i. Suppose a_i-8, a_i-7, ldots, a_i-1 are 8 consecutive integers whose sum of digits are also 8 consecutive numbers, so there must be one number that is divisible by 8. In summary, for any 15 consecutive integers, there must be one number whose sum of digits is a multiple of 8. This property does not hold for any number of consecutive integers less than 15.

We call such a tournament *balanced* if any four participating teams play exactly three matches between themselves. So, not all teams play against one another.

This means ( A ) has played against ( B ), ( B ) has played against ( C ), and ( C ) has played against ( A ). Now consider two other teams ( D ) and ( E ). By the hypothesis of the balanced tournament, neither ( D ) nor ( E ) has played against any of ( A, B, ) or ( C ). This leads to a contradiction because considering the four teams ( A, B, D, E ), there can be at most two matches among them, which violates the condition of having exactly three matches among any four teams. Therefore, no triangle can exist. Similarly, assume there exists an antitriangle involving teams ( A, B, ) and ( C ). This means none of ( A, B, ) and ( C ) have played against each other. Now consider two other teams ( D ) and ( E ). By the hypothesis, ( D ) and ( E ) must have played against each of ( A, B, ) and ( C ). This again leads to a contradiction because considering the four teams ( A, B, D, E ), there can be at most two matches among them, which violates the condition of having exactly three matches among any four teams. Therefore, no antitriangle can exist. 2. **Structure of the Tournament:** Given the lemma, we know that any four teams must be connected in a way such that they form a path (e.g., ( AB, BC, CD )). Now consider five teams ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E ). We can arrange them such that ( A, B, C, D ) form a path (in this order). Considering the teams ( B, C, D, E ), they must also be connected in that order to avoid creating a triangle or an antitriangle. Similarly, ( E ) must be connected to ( A ), creating a pentagon. 3. **Verification for ( n = 5 ):** The pentagon structure indeed works for ( n = 5 ). In a pentagon, each team plays against exactly two other teams, and any four teams among the five will have exactly three matches among them, satisfying the balanced tournament condition. 4. **Contradiction for ( n = 6 ):** Now assume there is a sixth team ( F ). By considering the teams ( A, B, C, ) and ( F ), there must be at least one edge of the form ( FA, FB, ) or ( FC ). This creates a contradiction because it would either form a triangle or an antitriangle, violating the balanced tournament condition.

Now, we can find the number of students below 8 years of age by subtracting the number of students of 8 years of age and the number of students above 8 years of age from the total number of students: Number of students below 8 years of age = Total number of students - (Number of students of 8 years of age + Number of students above 8 years of age) Number of students below 8 years of age = 50 - (24 + 16) Number of students below 8 years of age = 50 - 40 Number of students below 8 years of age = 10 Now, to find the percentage of students below 8 years of age, we use the formula: Percentage = (Number of students below 8 years of age / Total number of students) * 100 Percentage = (10 / 50) * 100 Percentage = 0.2 * 100 Percentage = 20% Therefore, the percentage of students below 8 years of age is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"w many fourdigit integers have a remainder of 3 when divided by 7, a remainder of 6 when divided by 10, a remainder of 8 when divided by 12, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 13? textbf{(A)} 1qquadtextbf{(B)} 2qquadtextbf{(C)} 3qquadtextbf{(D)} 4qquadtextbf{(E)} 5","completion":"1. **Formulate the congruences based on the given remainders:** [ n equiv 3 pmod{7}, quad n equiv 6 pmod{10}, quad n equiv 8 pmod{12}, quad n equiv 2 pmod{13} ] 2. **Express in terms of variables for each modulus:** [ n = 7a + 3, quad n = 10b + 6, quad n = 12c + 8, quad n = 13d + 2 ] where (a, b, c, d) are integers. 3. **Analyze the range for (n), which is a four-digit number:** [ 1000 leq n < 10000 ] 4. **Find common values satisfying all conditions using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):** - Start by ensuring (n) satisfies (n equiv 3 pmod{7}) and (n equiv 6 pmod{10}). - Use the method of successive substitutions to find a common solution modulo the least common multiple of 7, 10, 12, and 13, which is 5460. - Calculate a value for (n) and check if it fits within the four-digit range. 5. **Find all possible values of (n) within the range:** - Calculate (n) values by incrementing by 5460 (LCM of moduli) starting from the smallest solution in the range until the values exceed 9999. - Count the number of valid (n) values. 6. **Conclusion:** If (n = 5460k + m) is the smallest solution that fits the range 1000 to 9999, find how many values of (k) keep (n) as a four-digit number.

Since one asymptote of the hyperbola is perpendicular to the line x-3y+1=0, the slope of the asymptote is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line, which is frac{1}{3}. 2. So, the equations of the asymptotes are y = pm frac{1}{3}x. 3. Comparing these equations with the general form of the asymptotes of a hyperbola, which are y = pm frac{b}{a}x, we can deduce that frac{b}{a} = frac{1}{3}. 4.

Substituting b^2 from the previous step, we have c^2 = a^2 + frac{1}{9}a^2 = frac{10}{9}a^2. 7. The eccentricity (e) of the hyperbola is defined as e = frac{c}{a}. Substituting c^2 from the previous step, we have e = sqrt{frac{10}{9}} = frac{sqrt{10}}{3}. 8. However, since a > 0 and b > 0, the eccentricity should be positive.

This creates three smaller triangles within the original triangle, one of which has its base on the base of the original triangle. Prove that the height of this small triangle, relative to its base, is equal to the radius of the incircle of the original triangle. 1. **Setup and Notation:** Consider an isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( AB = AC ) and ( BC ) as the base. Let the incircle be tangent to ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) at points ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ), respectively. The center of the incircle is ( I ), and its radius is ( r ). 2. **Understand the Geometry:** The tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length. Thus, ( BD = BF ), ( CD = CE ), and ( AE = AF ). Let ( BD = BF = y ) and ( CD = CE = x ). Therefore, ( BC = BD + DC = y + x ). 3. **Small Triangle Identification:** The smaller triangles are ( triangle BDE ), ( triangle CDF ), and ( triangle DEF ). Among these, ( triangle DEF ) has its base ( EF ) on the base ( BC ) of the original triangle. 4. **Height Calculation for ( triangle DEF ):** The height of ( triangle DEF ) relative to its base ( EF ) is the perpendicular distance from ( I ) to ( EF ). Since ( I ) is the incenter, it is equidistant from all sides of ( triangle ABC ), so this height is ( r ). 5. **Conclusion:** The height of ( triangle DEF ), which has base ( EF ) on the base ( BC ) of ( triangle ABC ), is equal to ( r ), the radius of the incircle of ( triangle ABC ). Therefore, we have shown that the height of the smaller triangle, relative to its base on the base of the original triangle, is indeed equal to the radius of the incircle of the original triangle.

Since overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{c} are basis vectors and thus linearly independent and not coplanar, scaling these vectors by non-zero scalars (i.e., frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{3}, frac{1}{4}) does not change their linear independence or the fact that they are not coplanar. Therefore, the scaled vectors can indeed form a basis in space, making option A correct. **Option B**: The statement suggests that while overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{c} can be coplanar in pairs, all three cannot be coplanar simultaneously. However, this is a misunderstanding of the concept. Basis vectors, by definition, span the space, and for them to span a three-dimensional space, they cannot be coplanar either in pairs or together. Therefore, the interpretation given in the standard answer is incorrect, and option B's reasoning is flawed; hence, it is not a correct statement. **Option C**: This option implies there exists a unique pair of real numbers lambda, mu such that overrightarrow{c} = lambdaoverrightarrow{a} + muoverrightarrow{b}. Given that overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{c} form a basis, it means each vector cannot be written as a linear combination of the others, which directly contradicts the premise of option C.

We denote (F_n) as the number of such permutations, which we will call \\"nice\\" permutations. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Base Cases:** - For (n = 1): The only permutation is ((1)), and (2(1)) is divisible by (1), so (F_1 = 1). - For (n = 2): The permutations are ((1, 2)) and ((2, 1)), and both satisfy the property. Thus, (F_2 = 2). - For (n = 3): All (3!) permutations work: [ (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), text{ and } (3, 2, 1). ] Hence, (F_3 = 6). 2. **General Case for (n > 3):** Take any nice permutation ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n)) of ({1, 2, ldots, n}). Then, for (k = n-1), (2(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-1})) must be divisible by (n-1). Note: [ 2(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-1}) = 2left(sum_{i=1}^n a_i - a_nright) = 2left(frac{n(n+1)}{2} - a_nright) = n(n+1) - 2a_n. ] 3. **Simplify the Divisibility Condition:** [ n(n+1) - 2a_n = (n+1)(n-1) + (2 - 2a_n), ] where ((n+1)(n-1)) is evidently divisible by (n-1). Therefore, the term ((2 - 2a_n)) must be divisible by (n-1). 4. **Possible Values of (a_n):** Thus, (2a_n - 2) must be divisible by (n-1). The possible values for (2a_n - 2) are (0), (n-1), or (2(n-1)). Hence: [ a_n = 1 quad text{or} quad a_n = frac{n+1}{2} quad text{or} quad a_n = n. ] - **Eliminating (frac{n+1}{2}):** Suppose (a_n = frac{n+1}{2}). For (k = n-2): [ 2 left(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-2}right) = n(n+1) - (n+1) - 2a_{n-1}, ] which needs to be divisible by (n-2). This expression simplifies to: [ n(n-1) + (3 - 2a_{n-1}), ] so (2a_{n-1} - 3) must also be divisible by (n-2). Since (2a_{n-1} - 3) is odd, only: [ 2a_{n-1} - 3 = n-2, ] leading to (a_{n-1} = frac{n+1}{2}), implying (a_{n-1} = a_n), which is a contradiction. Thus, (frac{n+1}{2}) is not a possible value for (a_n). 5. **Recurrence Relations:** - If (a_n = n), the first (n-1) elements form a nice permutation of ({1, 2, ldots, n-1}). Hence, there are (F_{n-1}) such permutations. - If (a_n = 1), denote ((b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1})) where (b_i = a_i - 1) to form another nice permutation of ({1, 2, ldots, n-1}). Again, it gives (F_{n-1}) such permutations. Conclusion: Combining both cases shows the recurrence (F_n = 2F_{n-1}).

Find the sum of the reciprocals of their values.","completion":"To find the sum of the reciprocals of the values of all antipalindromic strings of length 2004, we need to consider the properties of antipalindromic strings and their values. 1. **Definition and Characteristics**: - An antipalindromic string of length (2004) is such that if you reverse the string and swap all (P)'s with (Q)'s and vice versa, you obtain the original string. - For example, the string (PPQPQQ) is antipalindromic. 2. **Number of Antipalindromic Strings**: - We are given that there are (2^{1002}) antipalindromic strings of this length. 3. **Value Assignment**: - The value of a string is defined as the product of the positions of the (P)'s. - For instance, in a string of length 2004, if the positions (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k) have (P)'s, then the value of the string is (a_1 times a_2 times ldots times a_k). 4. **Sum of Reciprocals**: - We need to compute the sum of the reciprocals of the values of these antipalindromic strings. - Consider the product (left(frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2004}right)left(frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2003}right)left(frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{2002}right) cdots left(frac{1}{1002} + frac{1}{1003}right)). 5. **Explanation of Each Factor**: - Each factor (left(frac{1}{n} + frac{1}{2005 - n}right)) arises because, for any antipalindromic string, for position (n) of a (P), there is a corresponding position (2005 - n) of a (Q) (and vice versa). 6. **Simplification**: - Simplify each factor: [ left(frac{1}{n} + frac{1}{2005 - n}right) = frac{2005}{n (2005 - n)} ] - Combining these factors, the entire product becomes: [ prod_{n=1}^{1002} left(frac{2005}{n (2005 - n)}right) ] - This product results in: [ frac{2005^{1002}}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots 1002 cdot 1003 cdot 1004 cdots 2004} ] 7. **Numerators and Denominators**: - Notice that the numerator is (2005^{1002}). - The denominator is the product of all integers from 1 to (2004). 8. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the sum of the reciprocals of the values of all antipalindromic strings of length 2004 is given by: [ frac{2005^{1002}}{2004!} ] Thus, the sum of the reciprocals of the values of all antipalindromic strings of length 2004 is: [ boxed{frac{2005^{1002}}{2004!}} ]"},{"prompt":"Calculate sequentially a_{1}=2times(1 dfrac {1}{4}), a_{2}=2times(1 dfrac {1}{4})(1 dfrac {1}{9}), a_{3}=2times(1 dfrac {1}{4})(1 dfrac {1}{9})(1 dfrac {1}{16}), a_{4}=2times(1 dfrac {1}{4})(1 dfrac {1}{9})(1 dfrac {1}{16})(1 dfrac {1}{25}), and conjecture the result of a_{n}=2times(1 dfrac {1}{4})(1 dfrac {1}{9})(1 dfrac {1}{16})ldots(1 dfrac {1}{(n+1)^{2}}) and prove your conclusion using mathematical induction.","completion":"Solution: a_{1}=2times(1- dfrac {1}{4})= dfrac {3}{2}, a_{2}=2times(1- dfrac {1}{4})(1- dfrac {1}{9})= dfrac {4}{3}, a_{3}=2times(1- dfrac {1}{4})(1- dfrac {1}{9})(1- dfrac {1}{16})= dfrac {5}{4}, a_{4}=2times(1- dfrac {1}{4})(1- dfrac {1}{9})(1- dfrac {1}{16})(1- dfrac {1}{25})= dfrac {6}{5}, Conjecture: a_{n}= dfrac {n+2}{n+1} Proof: (1) When n=1, it is obviously true; (2) Assume when n=k(kinmathbb{N}_{+}) the proposition holds, i.e., a_{k}= dfrac {k+2}{k+1} Then when n=k+1, a_{k+1}=a_{k}cdot[1- dfrac {1}{(k+2)^{2}}]= dfrac {k+3}{k+2} therefore The proposition holds From (1)(2), we know that a_{n}= dfrac {n+2}{n+1} holds for ninmathbb{N}_{+}.

Consider a vertex ( v in G ). Define ( X_v ) as the set of vertices in ( G ) that are path-connected to ( v ), and ( Y_v ) as the set of vertices in ( G ) that are not path-connected to ( v ). By definition, ( X_v cup Y_v = G ) and ( X_v cap Y_v = emptyset ). 2. **Assume ( |Y_v| ge 1 ):** Suppose there exists at least one vertex in ( Y_v ). We will derive a contradiction by analyzing the outdegree of vertices in ( Y_v ). 3. **Outdegree of ( w in Y_v ):** Consider a vertex ( w in Y_v ). We need to bound the outdegree of ( w ). - If ( z in X_v ), then the edge connecting ( w ) and ( z ) must point from ( w ) to ( z ) (i.e., ( w to z )), because ( z ) is not reachable from any vertex in ( Y_v ). Thus, the outdegree of ( w ) includes all vertices in ( X_v ), contributing ( |X_v| ) to the outdegree of ( w ). - For the vertices in ( Y_v ), let ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{|Y_v|} ) be the outdegrees of the vertices in ( Y_v ). Since the total number of edges among the vertices in ( Y_v ) is ( binom{|Y_v|}{2} ), there exists at least one vertex ( w ) in ( Y_v ) with outdegree at least ( frac{|Y_v| - 1}{2} ). 4. **Total Outdegree of ( w ):** The total outdegree of ( w ) is at most 500.

Hence, it follows that the number of such partitions of ( n+1 ) is at most the number of such partitions of ( n+2 ): [ f(n+1) - f(n) leq f(n+2) - f(n+1). ] 10.

Since ( r ) is prime, we can assume without loss of generality that ( r ) divides ( p ). Let ( p = rx ) for some integer ( x ). 2. Substituting ( p = rx ) into the equation ( pq = ra^2 ), we get: [ (rx)q = ra^2 implies xq = a^2 ] 3. Since ( p ) and ( q ) are relatively prime, ( r ) does not divide ( q ). Therefore, ( x ) and ( q ) must also be relatively prime. 4. The equation ( xq = a^2 ) implies that ( x ) and ( q ) are both factors of the perfect square ( a^2 ). Since ( x ) and ( q ) are relatively prime, each must be a perfect square itself. This is because the product of two relatively prime numbers is a perfect square if and only if each number is a perfect square. 5.

This simplifies the relation to depend solely on the areas derived from the bases in ABCD. 4. **Volumes Involving Point O:** Similarly, considering the pyramids divided further including point O instead of S, we have: [ V_{XO A B} + V_{XO C D} = V_{X O B C} + V_{X O D A} ] 5. **Combining the Volumes:** By subtracting the equality for volumes involving O from the corresponding volumes involving S, we obtain: [ (V_{XS A B} + V_{XS C D}) - (V_{XO A B} + V_{XO C D}) = (V_{X SB C} + V_{X S D A}) - (V_{X O B C} + V_{XO D A}) ] Since V_{XS AB} = V_{S O AB}, V_{XS CD} = V_{SO CD}, V_{XSB C} = V_{S O B C}, and V_{XSDA} = V_{SO D A} due to same triangular areas and heights considerations, the terms modify to: [ V_{SO A B} + V_{SO C D} = V_{SO B C} + V_{SO D A} ] This confirms the required volumetric relationship. # Conclusion: [ boxed{V_{O S A B} + V_{O S C D} = V_{O S B C} + V_{O S D A}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a_1=3 and a_n=S_{n1}+2^n, find the expressions for a_n and S_n.","completion":"Since a_1=3 and a_n=S_{n-1}+2^n, we have a_n-a_{n-1}=(S_{n-1}+2^n)-(S_{n-2}+2^{n-1}) =a_{n-1}+2^{n-1}, which implies a_n=2a_{n-1}+2^{n-1}.

From the information provided, we know that the crow eats a fifth of the total number of nuts in 8 hours. This means that the crow's eating rate is 1/5 of the nuts every 8 hours. If we want to find out how many hours it will take the crow to eat a different portion of the nuts, we can set up a proportion based on the rate of consumption. Let's say we want to find out how many hours it will take the crow to eat \\"p\\" portion of the nuts, where \\"p\\" is a fraction of the total nuts (for example, p could be 1/2 for half the nuts, 1/4 for a quarter of the nuts, etc.). We can set up the proportion as follows: (1/5 of nuts) / 8 hours = (p of nuts) / x hours Where \\"x\\" is the number of hours it will take the crow to eat \\"p\\" portion of the nuts.

For each one of these ( u ) triangles, the segment is counted ( u ) times in ( k(n-1) ), hence ( sum u^2 = k(n-1) ). - If we count the ( 3k ) edges of the ( k ) triangles, we are counting each one of these segments ( u ) times (as many times as it appears in a triangle), hence ( sum u = 3k ). 6. **Conclude the parity of ( k ):** - We conclude that [ (n-4)k = sum u^2 - sum u = sum u(u-1), ] where the sum is carried out over all possible segments formed by two points of the set other than ( P ), and each term in the sum is clearly even. Hence, ( (n-4)k ) is necessarily even. - If ( n ) is odd (e.g., ( n = 9 )), then ( k ) is even, and we are done.

Given a simple undirected graph G = (V, E) with |V| = 10 vertices and edges |E| = n that are 2-colored (either red or blue), we need to find the minimum value of n such that there always exists either a monochromatic triangle or a monochromatic quadrilateral. 2. Let's first analyze the scenario when the graph has exactly 45 edges (the maximum number of edges in a graph with 10 vertices, since binom{10}{2} = 45). 3. By Ramsey's theory, specifically R(3, 3) = 6, we know that any graph with 6 vertices (K_6) and 2 edges must contain a monochromatic triangle. Therefore, in a K_{10}, every subset of 6 vertices must contain a monochromatic triangle, implying our graph must contain such triangles. 4. However, we seek to minimize n, so we test values smaller than 45. We know from the condition in the problem that 4 cdot 44, meaning each edge of one color if there's 44 edges, will yield too simplistic scenarios because we need to minimize n. 5. Consider n = 31 edges. Use the Pigeonhole Principle to argue as follows: - If one color has at least lceil frac{31}{2} rceil = 16 edges, denote this color as blue. Thus the other color (red) has at most 15 edges. - From the Pigeonhole Principle, since a vertex v in V is connected to 9 other vertices and there are 16 edges of one color, there must be at least one vertex connecting three vertices (\`because for 16 vertices, one group must have at least 4 members, allowing the v vertex to have edges connecting 9\`). 6. To clarify: choose a vertex v that’s connected to three others all with blue edges. Since this must form at least k_6 = 6 vertices with 2-colored edges, any such following edges will theoretically adjust maintaining a definitive blue triangle or a forming at least quadrilaterals from that setup, must be present. 7.

The domain of f(x) is (-infty, 1) since the logarithm function is undefined for non-positive arguments. To find the intervals where f(x) is monotonic, we compute the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - 4ln(1-x)) = 2x - frac{4}{1-x}. This can also be written as: f'(x) = frac{-2(x-2)(x+1)}{1-x}. To determine the intervals of monotonicity, we analyze the sign of f'(x): - For f'(x) > 0, we find that x > -1. This means that f(x) is increasing on the interval (-1, 1). - For f'(x) < 0, we get x < -1. This indicates that f(x) is decreasing on the interval (-infty, -1). The extremum can be found by evaluating f(x) at the critical point x = -1: f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 4ln(1 - (-1)) = 1 - 4ln 2. Therefore, the minimal value of f(x) is boxed{1 - 4ln 2}. (2) For f(x) to be monotonic on the interval [-1, 1), the derivative f'(x) must hold the same sign throughout the interval. When f'(x) geq 0, we have: 2x - frac{2a}{1-x} geq 0 Rightarrow a leq min(x(1-x)). Since x(1-x) is maximal when x=frac{1}{2}, the minimum value is min(x(1-x))=-frac{1}{4} from the interval [-1,1).

With x(1-x) having a maximum value of frac{1}{4} at x=frac{1}{2}, this implies a geq frac{1}{4}. Combining both conditions, we conclude that the possible values of a are a leq -2 or a geq frac{1}{4}.

Define new coefficients: a_i' = N a_i quad text{and} quad b_i' = N b_i This transforms our equation into: x = frac{N b_i' a_j' - N a_i' b_j'}{N (a_i - a_j)} Simplifying the above: x = frac{N^2 (b_i a_j - a_i b_j)}{N^2 (a_i - a_j)} x = frac{b_i a_j - a_i b_j}{a_i - a_j} 6. **Ensure integer result:** Since (N) is the LCM of all (a_i - a_j), it is guaranteed that (a_i - a_j) is a divisor of (N) for each pair ((i,j)). Multiplying (a_i) and (b_i) by (N): - The numerator ((b_i a_j - a_i b_j)) becomes evenly divisible by (N). - The denominator (a_i - a_j) becomes evenly divisible by (N). Therefore, (x) remains an integer based on this transformation. # Conclusion: The x-coordinates of the intersection points of these 2021 functions can indeed be integer values.

Each person has exactly one friend at the table, and this friendship is reciprocal. Specifically, knights are always truthful, and their friend is a liar; conversely, liars always lie, and their friend is a knight. 2. Since the friendships are reciprocal and given that every knight has a liar as a friend and vice versa, it follows that the number of knights equals the number of liars. Therefore, out of the 30 people, there are 15 knights and 15 liars. 3. Consider the scenario where each pair of friends is answering the question: \\"Is your friend sitting next to you?\\" We need to determine the responses depending on whether friends are actually sitting next to each other or not. 4. Let’s analyze any pair of friends: - If they are sitting next to each other, a knight would answer \\"yes\\" (truthfully), and a liar would answer \\"no\\" (lying). - If they are not sitting next to each other, a knight would answer \\"no\\" (truthfully), and a liar would answer \\"yes\\" (lying). 5. Now, let's focus on the additional constraint provided in the problem: - It states that those sitting every second person (i.e., alternating around the table) all answered \\"yes.\\" 6. In alternating seating: - Suppose one such person is a knight and says \\"yes\\". Their friend, if immediately next to them, must be away (by the question setup). That friend's friend, answering \\"yes,\\" must thus validate that the friend's seat matches their answer. 7. This repeats through 15 alternating individuals, indicating an essential pattern. 8. A neat matching system must exist for consistency: - Review only remaining individuals (those not alternating): Knights and liars intersection must repeat but comply oppositely. 9.

Assign these groups to the four people. Step 1: Since four people need to share six tickets, and each person can have a maximum of two tickets, two people will get one ticket each, and the other two will get two tickets each. These tickets must be consecutive. This can be thought of as dividing the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] into four parts with three dividers, making sure that no three consecutive tickets are in the same group. We need to place 3 dividers in 5 available slots (between the numbers and on the sides), which results in C_5^3 = 10 possible cases.

If the product of the slopes of lines AB and AC is frac{1}{4}, find the value of k.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Equation of the Ellipse E Given that a vertex of E is A(-4,0) and the semi-minor axis has a length of 2, we can deduce the following: - The distance from the center of the ellipse to a vertex along the x-axis is a=4. - The length of the semi-minor axis is b=2. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse E is derived from its standard form frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 by substituting a=4 and b=2: frac{x^2}{16}+frac{y^2}{4}=1. So, the equation of the ellipse E is boxed{frac{x^2}{16}+frac{y^2}{4}=1}. Part 2: Finding the Value of k Given that a line l with slope k passes through point P(2,1) and intersects the ellipse at points B and C, and the product of the slopes of lines AB and AC is -frac{1}{4}, we proceed as follows: 1. Let the equation of line AB be x=ty-4, where t is the slope of line AB. 2. Substituting x=ty-4 into the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{16}+frac{y^2}{4}=1, we get: (t^{2}+4)y^{2}-8ty=0. 3. Solving for y, we find y_{1}=frac{8t}{t^2+4}, and subsequently, x_{1}=frac{4t^2-16}{t^2+4}, leading to point B being left(frac{4t^2-16}{t^2+4}, frac{8t}{t^2+4}right). 4. Given the product of the slopes of lines AB and AC is -frac{1}{4}, we replace t with -frac{4}{t} to find point C as left(frac{16-4t^2}{4+t^2}, -frac{8t}{4+t^2}right). 5. Since B, C, and P are collinear, we can find k by using the slope formula: k=frac{-frac{8t}{4+t^2}-1}{frac{16-4t^2}{4+t^2}-2}=frac{frac{8t}{t^2+4}-1}{frac{4t^2-16}{t^2+4}-2}. 6. Simplifying the equation for k leads to a quartic equation in t: t^{4}-4t^{3}-16t-16=0. 7. Factoring this equation gives us (t^{2}+4)(t^{2}-4t-4)=0, which simplifies to t^{2}=4t+4. 8. Substituting t^{2}=4t+4 back into the equation for k, we find: k=frac{-8t-4-(4t+4)}{-6(4t+4)+8}=frac{1}{2}.

We have the fraction frac{|x|-2}{x-2} set to equal zero. This implies that the numerator of the fraction must be zero while the denominator is not zero (since division by zero is undefined). Therefore, we have two conditions to satisfy: - |x| - 2 = 0 - x - 2 neq 0 2. Solving the first condition |x| - 2 = 0 for x gives us: - |x| = 2 - This leads to two possible values for x: x = 2 or x = -2, because the absolute value of x can be 2 either if x itself is 2 or if x is -2. 3. The second condition, x - 2 neq 0, tells us that x cannot be 2. This is because if x were 2, the denominator of our original fraction would be zero, which is not allowed. 4. Combining the results from steps 2 and 3, we find that the only value of x that satisfies both conditions is x = -2. The value x = 2 is excluded by the second condition.

The surface area of each triangular prism includes three rectangles and two triangles. The sum of the surface areas for both triangular prisms after cutting through this face is: 2 times (5 times 4 + 2 times (5 times 3 + 4 times 3)) **Case 2: Cutting through the 5x3 or 4x3 face** Without loss of generality, consider cutting through the 5x3 face (the case for 4x3 would be mathematically identical due to the symmetry of the problem). The resulting triangular prisms will have a base of 5x3 and height 4. Similar to the previous case, the surface area will include three rectangles and two triangles for each prism. The sum of the surface areas for both triangular prisms after cutting through this face is: 2 times (5 times 3 + 2 times (5 times 4 + 3 times 4)) We calculate the surface area for each case: For Case 1: 2 times (20 + 2 times (15 + 12)) = 2 times (20 + 2 times 27) = 2 times (20 + 54) = 2 times 74 = 148 For Case 2: 2 times (15 + 2 times (20 + 12)) = 2 times (15 + 2 times 32) = 2 times (15 + 64) = 2 times 79 = 158 Since we are looking for the maximum possible sum, we can see that Case 2 yields a greater surface area total than Case 1.

Consider the first scenario: - If the line l is vertical and parallel to the y-axis, then it can be represented as x = c for some constant c. - Given that c intersects the hyperbola at points A and D and the asymptotes at points B and C, the intersections are symmetric around the y-axis. - As a result, |AB| = |CD| directly. 3. Consider the second scenario where l is not vertical: - Assume the equation of the line l is ( y = kx + m ). 4.

The conversion factor is 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s. Speed of the train in km/hr = 72 km/hr Speed of the train in m/s = 72 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (10 / 36) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (5 / 18) Speed of the train in m/s = 20 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train in m/s and the total distance to cover in meters, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the platform using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 520 m / 20 m/s Time = 26 seconds Therefore, it takes boxed{26} seconds for the goods train to cross the platform."},{"prompt":"Let f(x) be a function defined on mathbb{R} that is never zero.

What is the ratio of A's share to B's share in the profit?","completion":"To find the ratio of A's share to B's share in the profit, we need to calculate the amount of capital each person effectively contributed over the year, taking into account the time each person's capital was invested. A started the business with Rs. 4500 and was in the business for the entire year (12 months). B joined after 7 months, so B's capital was in the business for 12 - 7 = 5 months. Now, we calculate the effective capital contribution of each person, which is the product of the capital invested and the time it was invested for. A's effective capital contribution = Rs. 4500 * 12 months B's effective capital contribution = Rs. 16200 * 5 months Now, let's calculate these: A's effective capital contribution = Rs. 4500 * 12 = Rs. 54000 B's effective capital contribution = Rs. 16200 * 5 = Rs. 81000 The ratio of A's share to B's share in the profit is the same as the ratio of their effective capital contributions. So, the ratio of A's share to B's share = A's effective capital contribution : B's effective capital contribution = Rs. 54000 : Rs. 81000 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor. In this case, we can divide by Rs. 27000 (which is the GCD of 54000 and 81000). A's share : B's share = (Rs. 54000 / Rs. 27000) : (Rs. 81000 / Rs. 27000) = 2 : 3 Therefore, the ratio of A's share to B's share in the profit is boxed{2:3} ."},{"prompt":"Let ( n ) be an even number greater than 2.

There are ((n-2)!) ways to place the remaining rooks without attacking each other. - Thus, there are ((n-2)! cdot frac{n^2}{2}) placements where the rooks violate the coloring condition. 4. **Valid placements**: - Hence, the number of valid placements is: [ n! - (n-2)! cdot frac{n^2}{2} ] 5. **Simplifying the expression**: - Simplifying the term ( n! - (n-2)! cdot frac{n^2}{2} ): [ n! - (n-2)! cdot frac{n^2}{2} = (n-2)! left( n(n-1) - frac{n^2}{2} right) ] [ = (n-2)! left( n^2 - n - frac{n^2}{2} right) = (n-2)! left( frac{n^2}{2} - n right) ] [ = (n-2)! cdot frac{n}{2} cdot (n-2) ] 6. **Final result**: - This number is positive for even ( n > 2 ), ensuring that there are always valid ways to place ( n ) rooks such that no two attack each other and no two rooks stand on squares of the same color.

According to the problem, B subscribes 1/4 of the capital, C subscribes 1/5 of the capital, and A subscribes some part we'll call A's share. D subscribes the rest. So, B's share = 1/4 * X C's share = 1/5 * X The rest of the capital, which is D's share, would be the total capital minus the sum of A, B, and C's shares. D's share = X - (A's share + B's share + C's share) Since B's share is 1/4 of X and C's share is 1/5 of X, we can calculate D's share as follows: D's share = X - (A's share + 1/4*X + 1/5*X) Now, we know that the total profit is Rs. 2490 and A's share of the profit is Rs. 830. The share of the profit is directly proportional to the share of the capital. Therefore, the fraction of the profit that A gets should be equal to the fraction of the capital that A subscribes.

By examining the pattern in the grid, we need to count the eligible positions where the shape b can be embedded. 2. **Calculate Horizontal Translations:** - Since the hexagon is symmetrical, the number of positions of placing shape b horizontally or diagonally is determined by moving it within the bounds of shape a. - The specific counts are identified as follows: - In the first row, shape b can be placed in 4 positions. - In the second row, it can be placed in 5 positions. - In the third row, it can be placed in 6 positions. - In the fourth row, it can be placed in 5 positions. - In the fifth row, it can be placed in 4 positions. - Adding these numbers together gives the total number of positions without considering rotations: [ 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 24 ] Therefore, there are 24 different ways to position the shape b within shape a without considering rotations. 3. **Factor in Rotations:** Now, we take into account the rotations of shape b. Since the hexagon has rotational symmetry, shape b can be rotated into 3 distinct orientations, maintaining its alignment with the grid. 4. **Multiply by Rotation Possibilities:** - Since each of the 24 positions can accommodate shape b in 3 different rotations: [ 24 times 3 = 72 ] # Conclusion: There are ( 72 ) different ways to select the shape b from the hexagonal grid a while considering rotational equivalence.

Janet has 80 horses. It takes 25 days until all her fields are fertilized. How many gallons of fertilizer does each acre need?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total amount of fertilizer produced by all the horses in 25 days. Each horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day, so 80 horses would produce: 80 horses * 5 gallons/horse/day = 400 gallons/day Over 25 days, the total amount of fertilizer produced would be: 400 gallons/day * 25 days = 10,000 gallons Since Janet spreads the fertilizer over 20 acres and it takes her 25 days to do so, she is able to cover all the acres in 5 cycles (because 25 days / 5 days per cycle = 5 cycles), as she can spread fertilizer over 4 acres per day. Now, let's calculate the amount of fertilizer needed for each acre.

Upon the command left turn, some turned left, some turned right, and the rest turned around. Can the sergeant always position himself in the line such that he has an equal number of recruits facing him on both sides?","completion":"1. **Initial Positioning**: - Let us agree that when the sergeant stands in line, let m denote the number of recruits standing to the left of the sergeant facing towards him, and let n denote the number of recruits standing to the right of the sergeant facing towards him. 2. **Determine Starting Point**: - Assume the sergeant initially stands at the leftmost end of the line. In this situation, there are no recruits on his left side, so m = 0. If there are no recruits to the right facing him (n = 0), the problem is trivially solved since there are no recruits at all. However, if there is at least one recruit to the right facing him (n > 0), we need to perform further analysis. 3. **Moving Through the Line**: - Let the sergeant move from left to right along the line, passing by each recruit one by one. 4. **Effect on m and n**: - When the sergeant passes a recruit who is facing away from him, the recruit now faces towards the sergeant's previous position. This changes the count m by increasing it by 1, but n remains unchanged. - When the sergeant passes a recruit who is facing towards him, that recruit now faces away from his previous position. This decreases n by 1 while m remains unchanged. 5. **Iteration Until Reaching the Right End**: - Initially, the value m - n starts as a negative number since m = 0 and n > 0. Each recruit affects either m or n as described above, and m can increase while n can decrease. - As the sergeant continues moving right, we will eventually encounter a situation where m = n. This is because the difference m - n changes incrementally by at most 1 during each step of the sergeant's movement. 6. **Mathematical Verification**: - At the start, the difference m - n < 0. - As the sergeant moves right, m increases or n decreases, which means the value of m - n approaches zero. - Ultimately, when the sergeant reaches the end of the line, he must have passed an equal number of recruits on either side facing towards him to establish equilibrium (m = n). # Conclusion Thus, it is always possible for the sergeant to position himself in such a way in the line that there are an equal number of recruits on both sides facing towards him at some point during his traversal. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"w many of the following statements are true?

We can solve for y by cross-multiplying: 48 * x = 8 * y Now, we know that the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the two numbers is 432. The LCM of two numbers is also equal to the product of the two numbers divided by their GCD (Greatest Common Divisor). Since the first number is 48 and is a multiple of 8, we can assume that the GCD of the two numbers is 8 (since 48 is 8 times some integer, and the ratio suggests that the second number is also a multiple of 8).

The original price is 50 yuan per kilogram, and after two consecutive reductions, the price becomes 32 yuan per kilogram. The reductions are equal, so we can model this situation with the equation: [50(1-a)^2 = 32] To solve for a, we rearrange and simplify the equation: [ begin{align*} (1-a)^2 &= frac{32}{50} (1-a)^2 &= 0.64 1-a &= pmsqrt{0.64} 1-a &= pm0.8 a &= 1 mp 0.8 end{align*} ] This gives us two possible values for a: 1.8 and 0.2. Since a reduction percentage greater than 100% is not possible, we discard 1.8 and keep 0.2 or 20%. Therefore, the percentage of reduction each time is boxed{20%}.

After increasing the price by x yuan, the daily sales decrease by 20x kilograms. The market aims for a daily profit of 6000 yuan.

This configuration satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as each side is less than the sum of the other two sides. Therefore, the sides 3, 6, and 6 can indeed form a triangle. The perimeter in this case is calculated as the sum of all sides: [3 + 6 + 6 = 15.] **Case 2:** When one of the legs is 3, the triangle would have sides of lengths 3, 3, and 6. To check if these lengths can form a triangle, we apply the triangle inequality theorem. However, for these lengths, we find that: [3 + 3 = 6,] which means the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides equals the length of the longest side. This does not satisfy the strict inequality required by the triangle inequality theorem for forming a triangle. Therefore, this configuration is not possible, and we discard this case.

How many guests did not eat the brownies ala mode?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total number of brownie pieces that were eaten by the guests. Troy baked 2 pans of brownies, with 16 pieces per pan, so that's a total of 2 * 16 = 32 pieces. The guests ate all of one pan (16 pieces) and 75% of the second pan. 75% of 16 pieces is 0.75 * 16 = 12 pieces. So, in total, the guests ate 16 (from the first pan) + 12 (from the second pan) = 28 pieces of brownies. Now, let's calculate the total number of scoops of ice cream that were eaten. The guests ate 6 tubs of ice cream, with each tub providing 8 scoops. So, that's 6 * 8 = 48 scoops of ice cream. Brownies ala mode require 2 scoops of ice cream per serving. Since 28 pieces of brownies were eaten, and assuming each piece of brownie ala mode would be served with 2 scoops of ice cream, we would expect 28 * 2 = 56 scoops of ice cream to be used for brownies ala mode. However, only 48 scoops were eaten, which means that not all brownie pieces were served ala mode. To find out how many scoops were not used for brownies ala mode, we subtract the number of scoops actually eaten from the number of scoops that would have been used if all brownies were served ala mode: 56 (expected for ala mode) - 48 (actually eaten) = 8 scoops not used for ala mode. Since each guest who did not eat brownies ala mode would still eat 2 scoops of ice cream, we divide the number of scoops not used for ala mode by the number of scoops per guest: 8 scoops / 2 scoops per guest = 4 guests.

Using the Law of Sines, we can express sin A in terms of sin C and cosfrac{A}{2}: - frac{a}{sin A} = frac{c}{sin C} implies sin Asin C = sin Ccosfrac{A}{2}. Since sin C neq 0, we can divide both sides by sin C: - sin A = cosfrac{A}{2}. Expanding cosfrac{A}{2} using the double angle formula: - 2sinfrac{A}{2}cosfrac{A}{2} = cosfrac{A}{2}. Given 0 < frac{A}{2} < frac{pi}{2}, we know cosfrac{A}{2} neq 0, so we can divide both sides by cosfrac{A}{2}: - sinfrac{A}{2} = frac{1}{2}. This implies frac{A}{2} = frac{pi}{6}, so A = frac{pi}{3}.

We then alternately color these strips black and white. Let's show why this coloring ensures that any move by the crocodile lands on a square of a different color. - Any valid move of the crocodile includes a shift of m cells in one direction (say horizontal) followed by a shift of n cells in the perpendicular direction (vertical in this case). Since m = du and n = dv, and both u and v are odd, moving horizontally m cells means shifting by an odd multiple of d units horizontally, which means crossing an odd number of vertical strips of width d. - Because the strips alternate in color, crossing an odd number of strips ensures that the crocodile lands in a strip of the opposite color. So, in this case, each move of the crocodile takes it to a square of a different color, proving m and n. 2. **Case 2: u and v have different parities.** We partition the infinite board into squares of size d times d and color them in a checkerboard pattern. Let's show why this ensures alternating colors after each move. - Break down the crocodile's move into two parts: - First, it moves horizontally (or vertically) by m = du cells. Since one of u or v is even, du or dv is an even multiple of d. This means that if the move traverses an even number of d times d squares or ends within a square of the same color. - Secondly, it moves perpendicularly by n = dv cells. The parity of this movement will differ from the first movement, causing the final landing square color to switch since one d times d square will be odd in terms of horizontal or vertical position, and it will change the initial color. Hence, the crocodile will always end up on a square of the opposite color after each move, regardless of the specific combinations of m and n. # Conclusion: For any given pair (m, n), there is a way to color the infinite checkerboard such that any two cells connected by a single move of the crocodile will be colored differently.

The distance d from the center of the circle to the line x + y + a = 0 is given by: d = frac{lvert 1 - 1 + a rvert}{sqrt{2}} = frac{lvert a rvert}{sqrt{2}} Since d^2 + left(frac{1}{2}ABright)^2 = r^2, we have: left(frac{lvert a rvert}{sqrt{2}}right)^2 + 1^2 = (sqrt{5})^2 Solving for a, we get: frac{a^2}{2} + 1 = 5 a^2 = 8 a = pm sqrt{8} = pm 2sqrt{2} Therefore, the value of a is boxed{a = pm 2sqrt{2}}."},{"prompt":"k bought a set of 6 flower pots of different sizes at a total cost of 8.25 . each pot cost 0.3 more than the next one below it in size . what was the cost , in dollars , of the largest pot ?","completion":"Let's denote the cost of the smallest pot as x dollars.

The total number of books borrowed by these 4 students is 40 (total books) - 17 (books already accounted for) = 23 books. To maximize the number of books borrowed by a single student, we should minimize the number of books borrowed by the other students. Since each of these students borrowed at least 3 books, let's assume that 3 of them borrowed exactly 3 books each. That would contribute 3 * 3 = 9 books to the total.

To do this, we need to figure out how many he bought on Thursday first, since we know that on Thursday he bought a third of what he had on Tuesday. 4.

Its axis should not be parallel to the axes of S_1 and S_2. Continue drawing new strips in this manner, ensuring each strip has an axis that is not parallel to any of the axes of the previously drawn strips. 4. **Form Parallelograms**: The pairwise intersections of these strips form a finite set of parallelograms. Thus, each new strip passes through existing intersections without necessarily randomizing using some distinct strip axes each time. 5. **Reiterate Until 10 Strips**: Continue this process until we have drawn 10 strips, ensuring each pair of 2 strips intersects, but any new strip does not intersect within the common part of any three existing strips. 6. **Draw Triangles**: Inside each strip, draw a sufficiently \\"long\\" triangle. This means the triangle should span most of the width of the strip, ensuring that it intersects any other triangle drawn in another strip at some point within the intersection of their respective strips. 7. **Ensure Conditions**: Arrange the triangles so that: - Any two triangles intersect at least once (as each pair of strips does intersect at some point over the plane). - No set of three triangles has a common intersection point (since each of the strips was explicitly planned to avoid common intersections beyond pairs, we ensure no triple region overlap). # Conclusion: The geometric arrangement ensures that every pair of triangles intersects at a point, while no set of three triangles shares a common intersection point.

By using the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, we can find the minimum value of 2a_7 + a_{11}. **Solution** Since the geometric mean of a_4 and a_{14} in the geometric sequence {a_n} with all positive terms is 2sqrt{2}, therefore a_4 cdot a_{14} = (2sqrt{2})^2 = 8, therefore a_7 cdot a_{11} = 8, Since a_7 > 0 and a_{11} > 0, therefore 2a_7 + a_{11} geqslant 2sqrt{2a_7 cdot a_{11}} = 2sqrt{2 times 8} = 8.

This ensures that at every stage, the same structure is maintained. 3. **Maintenance of Even Gaps:** - Each time player 1 or player 2 places a token or moves an existing one, player 1 adjusts their strategy to restore the even spacing of unoccupied cells. Consider any move by player 2 as possibly disrupting this balance. Player 1 can always restore it: - After player 2 makes a move, player 1 can place a token or move a token in such a way that the number of unoccupied cells between adjacent occupied cells or between the ends of the occupied cells and the board's edges remains even. 4. **Endgame:** - Eventually, there will be only one unoccupied cell left on the board. Since both players place one token per move, and there are 25 cells, it implies that the game will end after an odd number of moves. - With player 1 making the first move, after an odd number of moves, it will be player 1's turn to place the last (25th) token. **Conclusion:** By following this strategy, the first player ensures that the last move, which fills the final cell (hence winning the game), will always be theirs.

In the triangle ( CPQ ), ( k_1 ) is the inscribed circle and ( k_2 ) is the escribed circle. A known property in such triangles is that the lines drawn from the vertices to the points of tangency with the inscribed and escribed circles (relative to that vertex) are equal. Hence, ( PF_1 = QE_1 ) and ( PF_2 = QE_2 ). Using this, we have: [ E_1 E_2 = E_1 P + P E_2 = PF_1 + PF_2 = F_2 Q + PF_2 = PQ ] This shows that the section of the common internal tangent lying between the angle rays ( CP ) and ( CQ ) is equal to the distance between the tangency points of the common external tangent. 4. Next, let ( M ) be the projection of ( O_1 ) onto the line passing through ( O_2 ) and perpendicular to the segment ( E_2O_2 ).

It is known that a stronger team always beats a weaker team; however, if equally strong teams play against each other, it is impossible to predict in advance which one will win.

Is it always possible to divide the participants into pairs in such a way that in any match, the winner can be guaranteed? If not always, describe all cases where this is impossible and explain why.","completion":"1. **Observation:** Notice that if in any round there are only teams of different strengths, it is possible to predict the winner in each match of this and all subsequent rounds. This is because matches occur between teams of different strengths, hence it is pre-determined which team will win. 2. **Key Insight:** We are given that the strengths of 16 participating teams are represented by 15 distinct values. By the pigeonhole principle, this means that two teams will have the same strength. Let's denote these teams as team i and team j. 3. **Notation:** - Let the strengths of the teams be represented by the set {s_k} where ( k in {0, 1, 2, ldots, 14} ). - Assume ( s_i = s_j ) and without loss of generality, let these values range from 1 to 15 in natural numbers. 4. **Case Analysis:** - **Case a) ( s_i = s_j leq 14 ):** - In the first round, pair team i (one of the teams with identical strength) with a team of strength 15 (the strongest team). Pair the rest of the teams arbitrarily. - Since all other teams have unique strengths, predicting outcomes in these matches is straightforward. - Clearly, team i will lose in the first round and will not proceed to the subsequent rounds. Thus, in the next rounds, we will have teams with distinct strengths allowing us to predict the winners in all matches from this point onwards. **Conclusion:** If ( s_i = s_j leq 14 ), it is possible to arrange the matches such that the winner of every match can be predicted. 5. **Case b) ( s_i = s_j = 15 ):** - Since teams i and j have the highest strength, they will win all their matches against other teams. As the number of teams is halved each round, ultimately, teams i and j will face each other. **Conclusion:** If ( s_i = s_j = 15 ), teams i and j will inevitably face each other in the final match (or a match at some stage), making it impossible to predict the winner of this specific match. In summary, the scenarios can be handled as follows: - Predictable matches in all rounds if the teams with identical strength are not the strongest. - Unpredictable final or crucial match if the identical strength teams are the strongest. Thus, it is not always possible to guarantee that the winner of every match can be predicted. Conclusively, the answer to the problem is as follows: [ boxed{text{Not always.

After 10 days, there were ( x - 10 ) days of food left for 150 men. But at this point, 25 men left, so there were only 125 men remaining. The food then lasted for another 42 days for these 125 men.

Considering triangle (triangle ABE), we can apply the Stewart's theorem, which states: [ AB^2 cdot CE + BE^2 cdot AD = AC^2 cdot BE + DE^2 cdot AB + AE cdot BD^2 ] Simplifying for our given terms, we have: [ min {a^2, b^2} leq frac{a^2 cdot k + b cdot g}{k + g} ] 4.

Prove that the circles circumscribing (triangle BMR) and (triangle CNR) intersect at a point on (BC). 1. **Understanding the Problem:** To prove that the circumcircles of (triangle BMR) and (triangle CNR) intersect at a point on (BC), we need to show that (angle BMR + angle CNR = 180^circ). This is equivalent to showing that ( R) lies on the radical axis of the two circles. 2. **Key Relationships and Definitions:** - (O) is given as the midpoint of (BC), so ( OM = ON = frac{1}{2}BC ). - We need to use the fact that (M) and (N) are feet of the altitudes, so the triangles (triangle BMR) and (triangle CNR) are right triangles with (angle BMR) and (angle CNR) as right angles. 3. **Using Sine Rule in the Triangles:** By the definition of the segments (MR = NR) (since (R) is on the angle bisector of (angle MON)): [ frac{sin angle AMR}{sin angle MAR} = frac{AR}{MR} = frac{AR}{NR} = frac{sin angle ANR}{sin angle NAR} ] which implies: (sin angle AMR = sin angle ANR). 4. **Contradiction Argument to Strengthen Proof:** If we assume that (angle AMR = angle ANR), triangles (triangle AMR) and (triangle ANR) would be congruent by ASA (Angle-Side-Angle): - This would imply (AM = AN) - Consequently, it would lead to (AB = AC), contradicting the fact that (ABC) is a scalene triangle.

Let Z be a cycle in G, and suppose this cycle sequentially visits the vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{3k}. 2. **Existence of Path S**: Assume there is a path S connecting two vertices A_m and A_n within cycle Z that doesn't traverse any edge of cycle Z.

Since the lengths of both cycles Z_1 and Z_2 are divisible by 3, the length of path S would also be divisible by 3. 3. **Vertices Outside Cycle Z**: Consequently, no vertex X outside cycle Z can be connected by edges to two different vertices within cycle Z.

We are given the following geometric setup: 1. Points (A, B, C, D) lie on a circle in that order. 2. Lines (AB) and (CD) intersect at (M), and lines (AD) and (BC) intersect at (N). Since (A) and (C) are diametrically opposite, the following angles must hold: - (widehat{A B C}) and (widehat{A D C}) are right angles, because any angle subtended by a diameter in a circle is a right angle.

For the curve to be a circle, the coefficients of x^2 and y^2 must be equal and positive. This occurs when 5-t = t-1, which simplifies to 2t = 6 or t = 3. Substituting t = 3 into the equation gives frac{x^2}{2} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1, which can be rewritten as x^2 + y^2 = 2. This represents a circle centered at the origin with radius sqrt{2}.

However, this condition alone does not disprove the possibility of C being an ellipse under other conditions, so we cannot directly conclude that option B is incorrect based solely on option A being correct. The correctness of option B is implicitly questioned by the validation of other options, but it's not directly refuted in this explanation. **Option C:** If C is an ellipse with foci on the x-axis, then the larger denominator must correspond to x^2, implying 5-t > t-1 > 0. Solving this inequality gives 1 < t < 3. Therefore, option C is correct. **Option D:** For C to be a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis, the equation transforms to frac{y^2}{t-1} - frac{x^2}{t-5} = 1. For this to represent a hyperbola, we need t-1 > 0 and t-5 < 0, which implies t > 1 and t < 5 simultaneously. However, the condition for the foci to be on the y-axis is not correctly interpreted in the standard solution. The correct interpretation should focus on the sign of the denominators, where t-1 > 0 for y^2 to contribute positively, and t-5 < 0 to ensure x^2 contributes negatively, which is not directly related to t < 1. Therefore, the explanation for option D being incorrect is not accurately addressing the condition for a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis. The correct condition for a hyperbola with foci on the y-axis would be t > 1 and not t < 1 as stated, but the conclusion that option D is incorrect is based on a misunderstanding of the conditions for the hyperbola's orientation.

We can express the total number of democrats as the sum of female democrats and male democrats: D_T = D_F + D_M Substituting the expressions for D_F and D_M, we get: 260 = 1/2 * F + 1/4 * M Since we know that F + M = 780, we can solve for F or M and then find D_F. Let's solve for M: M = 780 - F Now, substitute M in the equation for the total number of democrats: 260 = 1/2 * F + 1/4 * (780 - F) Multiply through by 4 to clear the fractions: 4 * 260 = 2 * F + (780 - F) 1040 = 2F + 780 - F 1040 = F + 780 Now, subtract 780 from both sides to solve for F: F = 1040 - 780 F = 260 Now that we have the number of female participants (F), we can find the number of female democrats (D_F): D_F = 1/2 * F D_F = 1/2 * 260 D_F = 130 So, there are boxed{130} female democrats."},{"prompt":"f Leo gains 10 pounds, he will weigh 50% more than his sister Kendra.

So we can write the equation: 90 = 1.5K To find Kendra's weight, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.5: K = 90 / 1.5 K = 60 pounds Now that we know Kendra's weight, we can find their combined current weight: Combined weight = Leo's weight + Kendra's weight Combined weight = 80 + 60 Combined weight = 140 pounds Therefore, the combined current weight of Leo and Kendra is boxed{140} pounds."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, if lg sin A, lg sin B, lg sin C form an arithmetic sequence, and the three internal angles, A, B, C, also form an arithmetic sequence, then the shape of the triangle is __________.","completion":"Since lg sin A, lg sin B, lg sin C form an arithmetic sequence, we have lg sin A + lg sin C = 2lg sin B, which implies sin^2 B = sin A sin C quad (1) Also, since the internal angles A, B, C form an arithmetic sequence, we have B = 60^{circ}. Substituting into (1) gives sin A sin C = frac{3}{4} quad (2) Assume A = 60^{circ} - alpha, C = 60^{circ} + alpha. Substituting into (2) gives sin (60^{circ} + alpha) sin (60^{circ} - alpha) = frac{3}{4}. Expanding, we get frac{3}{4}cos^2alpha - frac{1}{4}sin^2alpha = frac{3}{4}. This implies cos^2alpha = 1.
