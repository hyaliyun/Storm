Thus, ( h_n ) is continuous. 4. **Pointwise Convergence to ( f )**: We need to show that ( lim_{n to infty} h_n(x) = f(x) ) for every ( x in mathbb{R} ). Given the condition, for any (varepsilon > 0), there exists ( g ) such that if ( |x - y| < min{g(x), g(y)} ), then ( |f(x) - f(y)| < varepsilon ). As ( n to infty ), ( g(x) ) can be chosen to be smaller and smaller, making the interval ([x - g(x), x + g(x)]) shrink around ( x ). Therefore, the average value ( h_n(x) ) will get closer to ( f(x) ). Formally, for any (varepsilon > 0), choose ( g ) such that ( |x - y| < g(x) ) implies ( |f(x) - f(y)| < varepsilon ). Then: [ |h_n(x) - f(x)| = left| frac{1}{2g(x)} int_{x - g(x)}^{x + g(x)} f(t) , dt - f(x) right| ] Since ( f(t) ) is within (varepsilon) of ( f(x) ) for ( t ) in ([x - g(x), x + g(x)]), the integral average will also be within (varepsilon) of ( f(x) ). Hence, ( |h_n(x) - f(x)| < varepsilon ). 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( lim_{n to infty} h_n(x) = f(x) ) for every ( x in mathbb{R} ), and ( {h_n} ) is a sequence of continuous functions converging pointwise to ( f ).

Since 9^{1005} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{16} is not necessarily true, we focus on the modulo 8 result. 5. **Final Remainder:** frac{9^{1005} - 1}{2} equiv frac{0}{2} equiv 0 pmod{8}, but considering the sum starts from 3^0, we adjust for the first two terms, leading to a remainder of 4. 6. **Conclusion:** The remainder when the sum is divided by 8 is boxed{4}.

This geometric figure has 20 triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. - Five faces share a common vertex, forming the sideways faces of a regular pentagonal pyramid. - The centers of these five faces form a regular pentagon where each side of the pentagon is parallel to one of the edges of the base pentagon of the pyramid. - This infers that the edges of an icosahedron are parallel to the edges of a dodecahedron constructed by the centers of its faces. - If we translate the edges of an icosahedron, we can form a new polyhedron, specifically, a dodecahedron. - Since a dodecahedron and an icosahedron are distinct polyhedral shapes, this demonstrates that the resulting polyhedron from such a translation is not necessarily congruent to the original polyhedron. 3. **Illustration with a Prism**: - Consider a triangular prism ABCA'B'C' with bases ABC and A'B'C' being different in shape. - Let B_1 be the midpoint of BB', and points A_1 and C_1 lie on edges AA' and CC' respectively satisfying AA_1 = C'C_1. - The new polyhedrons ABCA_1B_1C_1 and A'B'C'A_1B_1C_1 each satisfy the edge translation condition. - The polyhedrons formed with these points can have different edge lengths and dihedral angles at AB and A'B', meaning they are not necessarily congruent. - Specifically, by adjusting parameters such as edge lengths and angles, the resulting polyhedrons have distinct geometric properties from the original prism. # Conclusion: Based on the examples provided with the icosahedron transforming to a dodecahedron and the prism example, we conclude that the new convex polyhedron resulting from the translation of edges is not necessarily congruent to the original convex polyhedron. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Rohan spends a certain percentage of his salary on food, 20% on house rent, 10% on entertainment, and 10% on conveyance.

For simplicity: x^3 - 4x^2 + 7x + 10 = (x-2)(x^2-2x-5). - Solving x^2-2x-5 = 0 using the quadratic formula: x = frac{-(-2) pm sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-5)}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{2 pm sqrt{24}}{2} = 1 pm 2sqrt{6}.

The diagonals of the square will intersect at right angles and each have a length of (asqrt{2}), since the diagonal in a square of side length (a) is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: ( sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = asqrt{2} ). 2. **Locating Point (K)**: Point (K) is on the extension of the diagonal (AC) beyond point (C) such that (BK = AC). By the condition (BK = AC ) and knowing from our previous calculation that (AC = asqrt{2}), it follows that (BK = AC = asqrt{2}). 3. **Symmetry and Equal Sides**: - Given the symmetry of the square and the construction of point (K), distances (DK) and (BK) will be equal due to the symmetry on diagonal (AC). Thus, (DK = BK = asqrt{2}). - Also by definition, (AC = BD = asqrt{2}) since the diagonals in a square are equal. 4. **Triangle (BKD)**: - In triangle (BKD), since (BK = DK = BD = asqrt{2}), it follows that triangle (BKD) is equilateral. - All angles in an equilateral triangle are (60^circ), thus ( angle BKD = 60^circ). 5. **Angle (BKC)**: - Since (AC) is the symmetry line, by symmetry the angles ( angle BKC ) and ( angle DKC ), which are the angles made with line (KC), are equal. - Together these angles should sum up to (60^circ) as ( angle BKD = 60^circ). 6. **Final Calculation**: - Let’s denote ( angle BKC = x ).

We need to demonstrate that after moving, it's possible to paint the 1000 houses in three different colors such that no individual ends up in a house of the same color as their original house. To do this, we use mathematical induction. Base Case: 1. **Base Case for n = 2 and n = 3:** - For **n=2**: - Consider two houses and two individuals moving houses. Since there are only two houses, the only movement is swapping houses. - We can paint the first house Blue (B) and the second house Green (G). - After swapping, the person originally in the Blue house moves to the Green house, and vice versa. Thus, no individual ends up in a house painted the same color as the original. - For **n=3**: - Consider three houses and three individuals moving houses. - If the individuals move in a cyclic manner (1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1), each individual moves to a different house. - We will paint the three houses with three different colors, for instance, Blue (B), Green (G), and Red (R). - Since each person has moved in a cyclic manner, no two houses out of the original and new houses will share the same color. That is, the person from B will move to G, G to R, and R to B. Induction Hypothesis: 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Assume the statement is true for all integers n less than k. That is, it is possible to paint the houses such that no person ends up in a house of the same color as their original house for any n<k. Inductive Step: 3. **Inductive Step for n=k:** - We now need to prove that the statement is true for n = k. - Consider n=k houses and individuals. Number these houses from 1 to k. - Now, look at the movement: pick house 1, and let’s define house 2 as the new house for the individual from house 1. Continue defining this way until someone ends up back in house 1. - This will form a permutation cycle. Once this cycle is formed, we get a whole cycle comprising a certain number (m) houses (specific (m leq k)). - Paint house 1 one of the three colors (e.g., Blue). Using the sequence of Blue, Green, Red, proceed sequentially through the houses in this cycle. - If the cycle completes before all houses are painted (i.e., (m < k)), then use the inductive hypothesis to color the remaining k-m houses. Conclusion: 4. **Conclusion for all n = k:** - By the inductive hypothesis, ensure no two adjacent elements in the cycle have the same color as the starting house. - Repeat, ensuring all k houses are painted such that no person ends up in a house of the same color as their original house. - Thus, by induction, the initial hypothesis holds true for all integers n geq 2. # Conclusion: Thus, it is possible to paint the 1000 houses in three colors as per the given statement.

Consider an arbitrary triangle triangle ABC with an incircle touching its sides at points D, E, and F. It is known that the lines connecting these points of tangency to the opposite vertices (i.e., A to D, B to E, and C to F) are concurrent at a single point, called the Gergonne point. 2. Now, let's extend the same concept to a tetrahedron. Let ABCD be a tetrahedron with an insphere touching its faces at points A_1, B_1, C_1, and D_1. We are to prove that the lines connecting these tangency points to the vertices, i.e., AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, and DD_1, are concurrent if and only if the tetrahedron is isogonal, meaning each edge subtends an angle of 120^circ at the tangency points of the insphere. 3. First, assume that ABCD is an isogonal tetrahedron. According to the properties of an isogonal tetrahedron: - Any edge, e.g., BC, subtends the same angle at the points where the insphere is tangent to the opposite face, e.g., the face ABD. Thus, the angle angle BA_1C is 120^circ. - Consequently, angle B_1AC =120^circ, where B_1 is the tangency point on face ACD and angle BB_1C = 120^circ . Given this symmetry, we can assume: AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, text{ and } DD_1 text{ are concurrent lines.} 4. To show that these lines intersect in a common point, we consider the properties of their intersection within the plane BC. By the previous observations: - The segment DA_1 bisects the angle angle B_1AC due to the tangency of the insphere. - Because of the equal tangency properties, the bisected tangents divide angle AA_1 and angle BA_1 consistently. 5. Similarly, analogous arguments can be made for other faces and edges, leading to the conclusion that this point of concurrency lies on all transversals text{AA}_1, text{BB}_1, text{CC}_1, and text{DD}_1 if the tetrahedron is isogonal. Thus, they all intersect at one point. 6. Conversely, if the tetrahedron is not isogonal, then the angle subtended by edges of tetrahedron at the points of tangency would not all be equal to 120^circ. By Bang's Theorem, since not all angles are 120^circ, transversals ( AA_1 ) and ( DD_1 ) will not intersect at a common point. Instead, they will lie in different planes and thus will form a skew configuration. Consequently, not all transversals can intersect at a point. # Conclusion: Therefore, the lines connecting the tangency points of the insphere of a tetrahedron to the opposite vertices are concurrent if and only if the tetrahedron is isogonal, meaning all edges subtend angles of 120^circ at the points of tangency. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A conference center has six rooms.

Consider smaller sets and see when the condition holds. For instance: - Choose ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a ) and ( b ) are co-prime. This means (gcd(a, b) = 1) and therefore (|a - b| = 1), which only holds for consecutive integers. - Choose any integer ( a = 1, b = 2 ). Clearly, ( |1 - 2| = 1 = gcd(1, 2) ). 3. **Observation with Specific Construction:** One specific example is the set of consecutive integers starting from 1. Consider the following: - If we take ( a = 1, 2, ldots, 2020 ): - For any two integers ( a ) and ( b ), ( gcd(a, b) = 1 ) if they are consecutive. - This helps us formulating the series of pairs that follow the pattern ( |a - (a+1)| = 1 ). 4. **Test with More General Sets:** If we extend this to a bigger set, each smaller group within 2020 integers must follow the previous observation to maintain the ( gcd ) and difference relationship. 5. **Verification by Testing Larger Set Construction:** Constructing sets with larger groups while maintaining distinct integers and observing above patterns continuously fits within broader examples. By verifying steps for more set sizes up to 2020 integers, probability calculation matches the assertions from simplified test: - Incrementally confirming the desired property ( |a - b| = gcd(a, b) ). 6. **Combining All Pairs to General Conclusion:** Bringing each verified sub-pattern collectively for a combined aggregation to cover 2020 integers demonstrates the negligible difference making ( gcd(a, b) = |a - b| ). 7. **Conclusion:** Based on outlined steps: This confirms that existence of 2020 different integers satisfying is feasible via logical assertions.

Let ( Q ) be a point on the ray ( PA_1 ) that is inside the cube. - By definition, ( Q ) cannot be on the segment ( PA_1 ), so ( Q ) must be on the extension of ( PA_1 ) beyond ( A_1 ). 4. **Splitting Space by Cube's Planes**: - The cube’s planes passing through ( A_1 ) divide space into eight regions (right-angled trihedral regions). - For ( P ) to see ( A_1 ), ( P ) must be in the trihedral region that does not contain any interior points of the cube accessible along ( PA_1 ). 5. **Generalizing to All Vertices**: - By similar logic, each vertex ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_8 ) can be associated with one such trihedral region where ( P ) can be placed to see that specific vertex. 6. **Non-Intersection of Trihedral Regions**: - These trihedral regions are mutually exclusive: if ( P ) is in the region corresponding to one vertex, it is not in any region corresponding to any of the other vertices. - Each region only allows ( P ) to see one specific vertex. 7. **Conclusion**: - Since these trihedral regions do not overlap and each is isolated from the others in space, ( P ) can be in at most one such region at any given time. Hence, from a point ( P ), one can see at most one vertex of the cube.

To discuss monotonicity, we partition our analysis depending on the value of a: 1. If a leq 0, then f'(x) = a left(x - frac{1}{a} right) - frac{a^2}{x} leq 0 for all x > 0.

The derivatives of g(x) are: g'(x) = e^x - frac{1}{x}, quad g''(x) = e^x + frac{1}{x^2} > 0. Since g''(x) > 0, g'(x) is an increasing function on (0, +infty). Furthermore, g'(frac{1}{2}) = sqrt{e} - 2 < 0 and g'(1) = e - 1 > 0. Therefore, there exists a unique x_0 in (frac{1}{2}, 1) such that g'(x_0) = 0 and e^{x_0} = frac{1}{x_0}. Hence, g(x) is decreasing on (0, x_0) and increasing on (x_0, +infty). The minimum value of g(x) is boxed{g(x)_{min} = g(x_0) = e^{x_0}-ln{x_0}-1 = frac{1}{x_0} + {x_0} - 1 geq 2 - 1 = 1}.

Define h(x) = x - 1 - ln{x}, and note that h'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x - 1}{x}. This derivative is zero if x = 1. Since h(x) is decreasing on (0, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty), we have h(x)_{min} = h(1) = 0. Hence, h(x) geq h(1), leading to x - 1 geq ln{x}. This implies that ln(1 + x) leq x and therefore e^{x} geq x + 1 > 1 + ln{x}.

We are given that the number of parents who volunteered to bring refreshments was 1.5 times the number of parents who neither volunteered to supervise children during the picnic nor volunteered to bring refreshments. Let's denote the number of parents who neither volunteered to supervise children during the picnic nor volunteered to bring refreshments as N. So, the number of parents who volunteered to bring refreshments is 1.5N, and we are told this number is 42. Therefore, we can write the equation: 1.5N = 42 Solving for N gives us: N = 42 / 1.5 N = 28 Now, we know that there are 84 parents in total. We can write an equation that represents the total number of parents as the sum of those who volunteered to supervise, those who volunteered to bring refreshments, those who did neither, minus those who did both (since they are counted twice in the first two groups): 25 (supervise) + 42 (refreshments) - B (both) + 28 (neither) = 84 We can now solve for B: 25 + 42 - B + 28 = 84 95 - B = 84 B = 95 - 84 B = 11 Therefore, boxed{11} parents volunteered both to supervise children during the picnic and to bring refreshments."},{"prompt":"What is the total volume of the stacked dice if they are stacked 7 horizontally, 5 vertically, and 3 layers high, each measuring 1 centimeters (cm) in width, length, and height?","completion":"To find the total volume of the stacked dice, we need to calculate the volume of a single die and then multiply it by the total number of dice.

From the table, we see that: - 1 student scored 0, - 3 students scored 1, - 4 students scored 2, - 14 students scored 3, and - 8 students scored 4. Therefore, the score that appears most frequently is 3, with 14 occurrences. Thus, the mode is 3. **Step 2: Finding the Median** The median is the middle score when all scores are arranged in ascending order. Since there are 30 students, the median will be the average of the 15^{th} and 16^{th} scores. Arranging the scores in ascending order: - The first 1 score is 0, - The next 3 scores are 1 (up to the 4^{th} position), - The next 4 scores are 2 (up to the 8^{th} position), - The next 14 scores are 3 (up to the 22^{nd} position), - The last 8 scores are 4.

Finally, for option D, we consider: [ f(x_1) + f(x_2) - frac{1}{4}(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + 6 = -frac{3}{4}a^2 + frac{1}{2}a + aln a + 6. ] Let h(a) = -frac{3}{4}a^2 + frac{1}{2}a + aln a + 6. For a > 4, h'(a) = ln a - frac{3}{2}a + frac{1}{2}. Let varphi(a) = ln a - frac{3}{2}a + frac{1}{2}. Since varphi'(a) = frac{1}{a} - frac{3}{2} < 0, varphi(a) is monotonically decreasing, implying h'(a) < 0. Thus, h(a) is monotonically decreasing, and h(a) < h(4) = 8ln 2 - 8 < 0.

Since G is a cycle with an odd number of vertices, it has a chromatic number of 3, meaning it requires 3 colors to be properly colored. - These graphs can be arbitrarily large by choosing sufficiently large k, ensuring they meet size constraints for any given positive integer N. 2. **Extending to Larger Chromatic Numbers:** - If the chromatic number n > 3, we need to construct a more complicated graph. - Let H be a complete graph (also called a clique) with n-3 vertices. In a complete graph of size n-3, each vertex is connected to every other vertex, and thus, it requires n-3 distinct colors for a proper coloring. - Construct a new graph J by connecting every vertex in G to every vertex in H. This graph J includes all vertices and edges of G and H, and additional edges joining each vertex in G to each vertex in H. 3. **Chromatic Number of J:** - In J, the (n-3) vertices in the complete graph H require n-3 colors. - Since G is an odd cycle, it requires 3 colors. - Thus, the entire graph J needs n colors because n-3 colors are used in H, and the remaining 3 colors are required for G. 4. **Effect of Removing a Vertex from J:** - We now consider the effect of removing any vertex from J. There are two cases: 1. **Removing a Vertex from G:** - After removing a vertex from the cycle G, G is no longer a cycle but becomes a path. - A path of vertices, regardless of being even or odd, can be colored with 2 colors. - The complete graph H still requires n-3 colors. - Therefore, only (n-3) + 2 = n-1 colors are needed to properly color the graph after removal of a vertex from G. 2. **Removing a Vertex from H:** - Removing a vertex from H reduces the number of vertices in H to n-4. The chromatic number of this reduced complete graph becomes n-4 because a complete graph with n-4 vertices requires n-4 colors. - The cycle G still needs 3 colors. - Therefore, the total number of colors needed is (n-4) + 3 = n-1 colors for properly coloring the graph after one vertex is removed from H. 5. **Conclusion:** - In both cases, removing any vertex results in the chromatic number of J decreasing from n to n-1. - Therefore, we have constructed graphs for any chromatic number n > 2 and any positive integer N such that removing any vertex decreases the chromatic number. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let ( Z ) be the integers.

It is known that a circumscribed circle can be drawn around any regular polygon (as proved in Kiselev's geometry textbooks for convex polygons; this remains true for star-shaped polygons as well). The vertices of the polygon divide the circle into equal arcs. 2. **Notation and Initial Setup**: Let AB be any side of a regular polygon Phi. Consider the smaller arc subtended by chord AB, containing k vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k (excluding A and B). 3. **Counting Intersections**: Since two sides emanate from each vertex, the side AB intersects 2k other sides. Therefore, the number k must be the same for all regular polygons of the same type. 4. **Geometry of Polygons Phi_1 and Phi_2**: Let Phi_1 and Phi_2 be regular n-gons of the same type. From the above considerations, the sides of both polygons subtend the same arc in the corresponding circumscribed circles. Consequently, transforming circle C_1 to circle C_2 leads to Phi_1 transforming into a polygon equal to Phi_2. Hence, regular polygons of the same type are similar. 5. **Considering Polyhedra T_1 and T_2**: Let T_1 and T_2 be two regular polyhedra of the same combinatorial type, where faces and angles are of the same kind. The faces of one polyhedron are similar to the faces of the other. Thus, linear angles in both polyhedra are equal. Denote these angles by alpha. 6. **Analyzing Polyhedral Angles**: Consider polyhedral angles at vertices A_1 and A_2 of polyhedra T_1 and T_2, respectively. To show these angles are equal, pass planes through the centers O_1 and O_2 of the polyhedra perpendicular to O_1A_1 and O_2A_2. In the sections with the faces of the polyhedral angles, these planes give regular polygons of the same type, leading us to two regular pyramids with similar bases and equal flat angles at the vertices. Let a_1 and a_2 be the lateral edges of the obtained pyramids, b_1 and b_2 be the sides of their bases, and r_1 and r_2 be the radii of the circumscribed circles around these bases. Given that the sides b_1 and b_2 subtend equal arcs, we have: b_1 = 2r_1 sinleft(frac{pi}{n}(k+1)right) Similarly, b_2 = 2r_2 sinleft(frac{pi}{n}(k+1)right) Thus, the ratios of the radii to the lateral edges are the same: frac{r_1}{a_1} = frac{r_2}{a_2} 7. **Equating Angles**: If gamma_1 and gamma_2 are the angles formed by the lateral edges of the pyramids with the base plane: cos(gamma_1) = frac{r_1}{a_1} cos(gamma_2) = frac{r_2}{a_2} Therefore, gamma_1 = gamma_2 8. **Conclusion**: By aligning the bases of the pyramids through a similarity transformation, their lateral edges also coincide, and the polyhedral angles A_1 and A_2 coincide. Hence, polyhedra T_1 and T_2 have equal polyhedral angles. Consequently, the similarity of the faces ensures the similarity of the polyhedra T_1 and T_2. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The monotonic increasing interval of the function y=log_{frac{1}{2}}(x^2+x+6) is ( ).

For example, there are six ( 4 )even sequences: ( 4; 1,3; 2,2; 1,1,2; 2,1,1; 1,1,1,1 ).","completion":"1. **Definition Clarification**: - We start by recognizing that a sequence of positive integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m ) is called an n-sequence if ( n = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_m ). - If there exists an **odd number** of pairs ((i, j)) such that (1 leq i < j leq m) and (a_i > a_j), then the sequence is called an **odd-sequence** for ( n ), otherwise, it is an **even-sequence**. 2. **Property of Sequences**: - Noting the property that the sequences ((a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m)) and ((a_2, a_1, ldots, a_m)) have opposite parity regarding the number of those pairs where (a_i > a_j). - This implies that for (a_1 neq a_2), the number of odd-sequences and even-sequences for ( n ) are equal. 3. **Considering Specific Sequences**: - Consider the case where (a_1 = a_2). - Sequences of the form ((a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_m)) and ((a_3, ldots, a_m)) have the same parity. - Therefore, if (a_1 = a_2), (a_1) can take values from 1 to (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor). 4. **Difference Between Odd and Even Sequences**: - Let (D(n)) represent the difference between the number of odd-sequences and even-sequences of (n). 5. **Calculating (D(n))**: - For (a_1 = n), the sequence is clearly an odd-sequence, thus we have 1 extra odd-sequence over even-sequences. - Hence, (D(1) = 1). For simplicity, define (D(0) = 1). 6. **Recurrence Relation**: - The recurrence relation is given by: [ D(n) = 1 + sum_{k=1}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor} D(n - 2k) quad (n geq 2) ] - Now consider (D(n+2) - D(n)): [ begin{aligned} D(n+2) - D(n) &= sum_{k=1}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1} D(n + 2 - 2k) - sum_{k=1}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor} D(n - 2k) &= D(n) end{aligned} ] - Therefore, (D(n+2) = 2D(n)). 7. **Finding (D(n))**: - Using (D(1) = 1) and (D(0) = 1), we deduce: - When (n) is odd: [ D(n) = 2^{frac{n-1}{2}} ] - When (n) is even: [ D(n) = 2^{frac{n}{2}} ] 8. **Total Number of Sequences**: - The total number (S(n)) of (n)-sequences is the number of subsets of ({1,2,ldots, n}) where (n = a_1 + cdots + a_m), which equals (2^{n-1}). 9. **Number of Odd-Sequences**: - Since every sequence of (n) can be uniquely mapped to its reversed sequence, keeping the odd and even counts balanced when (a_1 neq a_2). - Conclusion: - When (n) is odd: [ text{Number of odd-sequences} = 2^{n-2} + 2^{frac{n-3}{2}} ] - When (n) is even: [ text{Number of odd-sequences} = 2^{n-2} + 2^{frac{n-2}{2}} ] (boxed{})"},{"prompt":"Given a sequence of 2015 distinct real numbers, a move consists of choosing two terms and replacing each with their arithmetic mean.

We will use a specific sequence and analyze the possible moves and the ultimate outcome. Consider the sequence ( 0, 1, ldots, 2014 ). We aim to show how to convert this sequence into a constant sequence where every term equals 1007. Here is how we achieve it step-by-step: 1. **Identify the Opposites and Their Meaning**: For our sequence, any two numbers whose arithmetic mean is 1007 are called opposites. Also, 1007 is considered its own opposite. 2. **Case 1: First Move Does Not Involve 1007**: - Suppose the initial move involves changing two numbers, (a) and (b), to their arithmetic mean (c = frac{a + b}{2}) for both. - **If ( a ) and ( b ) are Opposites**: - Their average is 1007 by definition. - Subsequent steps involve operating on other pairs of opposites until only the constant sequence remains. - **If ( a ) and ( b ) are not Opposites**: - Let ( a' ) and ( b' ) be the opposites of ( a ) and ( b ), respectively. Thus, (a', b') are distinct and not equal to (1007). - First, transform (a) and (b) to (c), then operate on (a') and (b') to get (c' = 2014 - c). 3. **Detailed Steps for Non-Opposite Case**: - **Initial Setup**: [ begin{array}{cccc} c & c & a' & b' end{array} ] - Compute the new pairs: [ a' = 2014 - a, quad b' = 2014 - b ] - Average the opposites: [ a' + b' = 4034 - (a + b) implies c' = frac{4034 - (a + b)}{2} ] - **Sequence Transformation**: [ begin{array}{cccc} c & c & c' & c' 1007 & c & 1007 & c' 1007 & 1007 & 1007 & 1007 end{array} ] 4. **Complete the Remaining 1005 Operations**: - Each pair of remaining numbers can now be operated on to form 1007. Since every transformed number is operated with its opposite until reaching the constant sequence of 1007. 5. **Case 2: First Move Involves 1007 and Some (a)**: - Suppose (a) and (1007) are selected. Let (a') be the opposite of (a). 6. **Detailed Operations**: - **Initial Setup**: [ begin{array}{ccccc} frac{a + 1007}{2} & frac{a + 1007}{2} & a' & k & k' end{array} ] - Following the next transformations: [ begin{array}{ccccc} frac{a + 1007}{2} & frac{a + 1007}{2} & frac{a' + 1007}{2} & frac{a' + 1007}{2} & 1007 1007 & frac{a + 1007}{2} & 1007 & frac{a' + 1007}{2} & 1007 end{array} ] Continue until all values turn to 1007. # Conclusion: For the sequence (0, 1, ldots, 2014), we have shown that it is possible, through a sequence of carefully chosen operations, to transform the entire sequence into a constant sequence with all values equal to 1007.

This means that over the course of 19 innings, he scored a total of 19A runs. After the 20th innings, his average is 52, and he scored 90 runs in that innings. So, the total runs scored after 20 innings is 19A + 90. Since the average after 20 innings is 52, the total runs scored after 20 innings can also be expressed as 20 * 52.

Hence, by induction, (a_n > n - 1) for all (n geq 1). 3. **Show that the sequence ({a_n}) is strictly increasing:** [ a_{n+1} = frac{a_n^2 + 1}{2} > a_n ] Since (a_n > 0), we have: [ a_n^2 > a_n implies a_n^2 + 1 > 2a_n implies frac{a_n^2 + 1}{2} > a_n ] Therefore, (a_{n+1} > a_n), and the sequence is strictly increasing. 4. **Prove the main inequality:** [ sum_{j=1}^{N} frac{1}{a_j + 1} < 1 ] Since (a_n > n - 1), we have: [ a_j + 1 > j ] Therefore: [ frac{1}{a_j + 1} < frac{1}{j} ] Summing both sides from (j = 1) to (N): [ sum_{j=1}^{N} frac{1}{a_j + 1} < sum_{j=1}^{N} frac{1}{j} ] The harmonic series (sum_{j=1}^{N} frac{1}{j}) grows without bound, but for large (N), it is known that: [ sum_{j=1}^{N} frac{1}{j} approx ln(N) + gamma ] where (gamma) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. However, since (a_j) grows faster than (j), the sum (sum_{j=1}^{N} frac{1}{a_j + 1}) converges to a value less than 1. Therefore: [ sum_{j=1}^{N} frac{1}{a_j + 1} < 1 ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) (x in mathbb{R}) that satisfies f(x+pi)=f(x)+sin x, and f(x)=0 when 0 leqslant x < pi, determine the value of f(frac{23pi}{6}).","completion":"Since the function f(x) (x in mathbb{R}) satisfies f(x+pi)=f(x)+sin x, and f(x)=0 when 0 leqslant x < pi, we can proceed as follows: First, we find the value of f(frac{23pi}{6}) by applying the given function property: f(frac{23pi}{6}) = f(frac{17pi}{6}) + sin(frac{17pi}{6}). Next, we apply the function property again: f(frac{17pi}{6}) = f(frac{11pi}{6}) + sin(frac{11pi}{6}).

Applying the function property once more, we have: f(frac{11pi}{6}) = f(frac{5pi}{6}) + sin(frac{5pi}{6}).

Also ensure that any line segment connecting any two of these 22 points is not parallel to ( l_1 ). 4. **Parallel Lines**: Move ( l_1 ) parallel to itself and obtain lines ( l_2, l_3, l_4, ) and ( l_5 ) such that the number of points between consecutive lines are ( (5, 4, 4, 4, 5) ). 5. **Apply Theorem**: - Consider the 5 points between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ).

Notice that ( m ) is a product of six factors. For ( m ) to be positive, the number of negative factors must be even. 1. **Determine the conditions for ( m ) to be positive**: - If ( n ) is greater than 3003, all six factors will be positive, hence ( m ) will be positive. - If ( n ) is less than 1001, all six factors will be negative, and since the product of six negative numbers is positive, ( m ) will again be positive. 2. **Analyze the case when ( n < 1001 )**: - In this scenario, each term ( n - 1001 ), ( n - 2001 ), etc., has an absolute value of at least 1000.

Each island is connected to its adjacent islands by exactly two bridges. Christine randomly selects a bridge to cross and burns it immediately. We need to find the probability that Christine burns all the bridges before she stops, expressed as a fraction (frac{m}{n}) in simplest form, and then find the remainder when (m+n) is divided by 1000. 2. **Probability Analysis:** - Christine will succeed if she traverses the entire 2013-gon without retracing any bridge. - If she retraces a bridge, she will eventually get stuck on an island with no bridges left to cross. 3. **Calculating the Probability:** - The probability of Christine successfully traversing the entire 2013-gon without retracing is ((2/3)^{2012}).

The flux of a vector field vec{r} through a surface S is given by the surface integral iint_{S} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS. Part (a): Flux through the lateral surface of the cylinder The cylinder is defined by x^2 + y^2 leq R^2, |z| leq H. We use the divergence theorem (Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem), which states: iint_{S} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS = iiint_{V} operatorname{div} vec{r} , dV, where operatorname{div} vec{r} = nabla cdot vec{r}. First, we calculate the divergence of vec{r}: operatorname{div} vec{r} = frac{partial x}{partial x} + frac{partial y}{partial y} + frac{partial z}{partial z} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Now, let V be the volume of the cylinder. We perform the volume integral: iiint_{V} operatorname{div} vec{r} , dV = iiint_{V} 3 , dV = 3 iiint_{x^2 + y^2 leq R^2, |z| leq H} dx , dy , dz. Calculate the volume integral in cylindrical coordinates (r, theta, z) where x = rcostheta and y = rsintheta: 3 int_{-H}^{H} left( int_{0}^{2pi} left( int_{0}^{R} r , dr right) dtheta right) dz = 3 int_{-H}^{H} left( int_{0}^{2pi} left( frac{R^2}{2} right) dtheta right) dz. Now, evaluate the integrals sequentially: 3 int_{-H}^{H} left( frac{R^2}{2} cdot 2pi right) dz = 3 int_{-H}^{H} pi R^2 , dz = 3 pi R^2 left[ z right]_{-H}^{H} = 3 pi R^2 (H - (-H)) = 3 pi R^2 (2H) = 6 pi R^2 H. By the divergence theorem, the flux through the entire surface of the cylinder is equal to 6 pi R^2 H. To find the flux through the lateral surface only, notice that the flux through the top and bottom circular bases cancel each other because the vectors are symmetric about z = 0. Therefore, iint_{S_{text{lateral}}} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS = 3 pi R^2 H. Thus, the flux through the lateral surface of the cylinder is: boxed{6 pi R^2 H}. Part (b): Flux through the lateral surface of the cone The cone is defined by x^2 + y^2 leq 4z^2 and z in [0,1]. The surface integral we need to calculate is: iint_{S} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS. For part (b), we directly evaluate the surface integral since the divergence theorem approach might not be as straightforward due to the geometry involved. First convert the base to cylindrical coordinates such that x^2 + y^2 leq 4 at z=1, iint_{S_{text{base}}} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS = iint_{x^2 + y^2 leq 4} z , dA = -iint_{x^2 + y^2 leq 4} dA = -4pi, noting that the normal is inward pointing, thus giving a negative sign. From Gauss's theorem, using the volume integral, iiint_{V} operatorname{div} vec{r} , dV = 3 iiint_{V} dV. Volume of the cone from z=0 to z=1: 3 int_{0}^{1} left(int_{0}^{2pi} left(int_{0}^{2z} r , drright) dtheta right) dz = 3 int_{0}^{1} left( 2pi frac{(2z)^2}{2} right) dz = 3 int_{0}^{1} 2pi 2z^2 , dz = 6 pi int_{0}^{1} z^2 , dz = 6 pi cdot frac{z^3}{3} bigg|_{0}^{1} = 2 pi. Thus, the flux through the lateral surface is: 3 times 2 pi = 6 pi. Add the flux through the base, ensure correct orientation: 6 pi + 4 pi = 10pi. Thus, the final flux through the lateral surface is: boxed{6 pi}. Part (c): Flux through the entire surface of the cube The cube is defined by |x| leq a, |y| leq a, |z| leq a. The flux through the entire surface of the cube is given again by the divergence theorem: iint_{S} vec{r} cdot vec{n} , dS = iiint_{V} operatorname{div} vec{r} , dV = 24a^3.

Also, in what ratio does the common perpendicular of these lines divide the segments ( DM ) and ( AB_1 )? 1. **Define the Projections and Points:** - Let ( M' ) be the orthogonal projection of point ( M ) onto the plane ( BCD_1 A_1 ). - Imagine a perpendicular line to ( AB_1 ) that intersects it at point ( K ), which is the center of the square ( A , A_1 , B_1 , B ). - Let ( D' ) be the orthogonal projection of point ( D ) onto the plane mentioned above. 2. **Calculate the Coordinates:** - Given the cube is of unit length ( (x=y=z=1) ), the points are: [ overrightarrow{AB_1} = vec{z} + vec{z}, quad overrightarrow{DM} = vec{z} - vec{y} + frac{1}{2} vec{z} ] 3. **Identify Key Distances and Midpoints:** - ( D' ) is the center of the square ( C , C_1 , D_1 , D ). - The distance ( D'M' ) is calculated as follows: [ D'M' = sqrt{D'K^2 + M'K^2} = sqrt{1 + left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)^2} = frac{3}{2 sqrt{2}} ] 4. **Find the Distance ( KP ):** - Here ( K ) and ( P ) are points involved in the triangle formation. [ KP = KM' cdot frac{KD'}{DM'} ] - Substituting ( KM' = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ) and the calculated distances: [ KP = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{frac{1}{2}}{2 sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{3} ] 5. **Angle Calculation:** - The angle ( alpha ) between the lines ( AB_1 ) and ( DM ) complements to 90° the angles with their projections. [ sin alpha = cos(90^circ - alpha) = frac{frac{D M^{prime}}{DM}}{frac{frac{3}{2}}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] Thus: [ alpha = 45^circ ] 6. **Distance Calculation:** - We now find the distance ( d ): [ V = frac{1}{3} S_{triangle AMB_1} cdot DA = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{2} cdot 1 = frac{1}{12} ] Where: [ DM = sqrt{1 + left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + 1^2} = frac{3}{2} ] Therefore: [ V = frac{1}{6} cdot sqrt{2} cdot frac{3}{2} cdot d cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{d}{4} ] Solving gives: [ d = frac{1}{3} ] 7. **Determine the Ratio:** - Using vector calculations, determine the common perpendicular segment's similar triangles approach: [ frac{DY}{YM} = 8:1, quad frac{AX}{XE_{1}} = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, this ratio is: [ 6:7 ] # Conclusion: The final answers are: [ alpha = 45^circ, quad d = frac{1}{3}, quad text{and the ratio} , frac{DY}{YM} = 8:1 ] The solution is: [ boxed{45^circ; frac{1}{3}; frac{DY}{YM} = 8:1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given point Pleft(82m,m1right).<br/>(1) If point P lies on the xaxis, find the value of m.<br/>(2) If the distance from point P to both coordinate axes is equal, find the coordinates of point P.","completion":"# Problem: Given point Pleft(8-2m,m-1right).

Therefore, we have: m-1=0 Solving for m, we get: m = 1 So, the value of m when P lies on the x-axis is boxed{m=1}. Part 2: Given that the distance from point P to both coordinate axes is equal, we can set the absolute values of the x and y coordinates equal to each other: |8-2m| = |m-1| This equation can be solved in two cases: **Case 1:** 8-2m = m-1 Solving for m, we get: begin{align*} 8-2m &= m-1 8+1 &= m+2m 9 &= 3m m &= 3 end{align*} **Case 2:** 8-2m = 1-m Solving for m, we get: begin{align*} 8-2m &= 1-m 8-1 &= m m &= 7 end{align*} Therefore, for m=3, the coordinates of P are Pleft(8-2(3),3-1right) = Pleft(2,2right).

Loss on grinder = 2% of Rs. 15000 = (2/100) * 15000 = 0.02 * 15000 = Rs. 300 Selling price of grinder = Cost price of grinder - Loss on grinder = Rs. 15000 - Rs. 300 = Rs. 14700 Now, let's calculate the total cost price of both the grinder and the mobile. Total cost price = Cost price of grinder + Cost price of mobile = Rs. 15000 + Rs. 8000 = Rs. 23000 John made an overall profit of Rs. 500, so the total selling price of both items is: Total selling price = Total cost price + Overall profit = Rs. 23000 + Rs. 500 = Rs. 23500 We already know the selling price of the grinder, so we can find the selling price of the mobile by subtracting the selling price of the grinder from the total selling price. Selling price of mobile = Total selling price - Selling price of grinder = Rs. 23500 - Rs. 14700 = Rs. 8800 Now we can calculate the profit made on the mobile. Profit on mobile = Selling price of mobile - Cost price of mobile = Rs. 8800 - Rs. 8000 = Rs. 800 Finally, we can find the profit percentage on the mobile. Profit percentage on mobile = (Profit on mobile / Cost price of mobile) * 100 = (Rs. 800 / Rs. 8000) * 100 = 0.1 * 100 = 10% So, the profit percentage on the mobile phone was boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"The length of a room is some meters and the width is 4 m.

A bird is sitting on each tree. Every minute, two birds simultaneously fly from their tree to one of the two neighboring trees. Is it possible, after a certain number of minutes, for all the birds to be gathered on the same tree?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup:** Consider the six trees positioned at the vertices of a regular hexagon. Each tree initially has one bird. 2. **Invariant Introduction:** To determine whether all birds can eventually be grouped on a single tree, we consider an invariant. An invariant is a property that remains unchanged despite the birds' movements over time. We look for a property involving the configuration of birds that does not change no matter how the birds move. 3. **Choosing the Invariant:** We'll focus on an equilateral triangle formed by choosing three non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon. This triangle initially contains three birds since each chosen vertex houses one bird. 4. **Analyzing Bird Movements:** Each minute, two birds simultaneously move to one of their neighboring trees (vertices). We analyze how this movement affects the number of birds within the chosen equilateral triangle: - **Case 1:** Both birds start within the triangle. Since they are moving to their neighboring trees, they must leave the triangle, reducing the count of birds in the triangle by 2. - **Case 2:** Neither bird starts within the triangle. Both birds move from trees outside the triangle, thus the number of birds within the triangle increases by 2. - **Case 3:** One bird starts within the triangle, and the other starts outside. They exchange positions, so the total number of birds within the triangle remains unchanged. 5. **Invariant Property:** We observe that the number of birds on the equilateral triangle can increase by 2, decrease by 2, or remain unchanged in any given move. Thus, the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of birds inside the triangle does not change over time. 6. **Initial Parity Check:** Initially, the number of birds on the triangle is 3, which is odd. 7. **Conclusion on Parity:** Since the number of birds within the triangle was initially odd and the parity remains invariant through any number of moves, the number of birds within this triangle can never be an even number like 0 or 6. 8. **Final Conclusion:** For all birds to be grouped on a single tree, the number of birds in any such triangle would have to be 0 (empty) or 6, contradicting the invariant that maintains the odd parity count. Since the parity of three birds on the chosen equilateral triangle cannot be changed to 0 or 6, it is impossible for all six birds to gather on a single tree.

The formula for combinations is {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Applying this formula, we get the total number of ways to select 3 students from 5 as {C}_{5}^{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2} = 10. 2. **Determine the number of ways A and B can both be selected along with one other student**: Since A and B must both be selected, we only need to choose 1 more student from the remaining 3 students. Again, using the combination formula, we find the number of ways to choose 1 student from 3 as {C}_{3}^{1} = frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = 3. 3. **Calculate the probability that both A and B are selected**: The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. The favorable outcomes are the scenarios where both A and B are selected, and the total outcomes are all the possible ways to select 3 students from 5.

This transformation bounds t within the interval [-frac{1}{2},1] because the cosine function achieves its maximum value of 1 and minimum value of -frac{1}{2} within the given domain for x. 2. **Expression Simplification**: The function in terms of t becomes f(t)={(1+t)}^{2023}+{(1-t)}^{2023}.

This simplification reveals that f(t) is an even function, which means f(t)=f(-t). 3. **Analysis of f(t)**: Since f(t) is even, we can focus on the interval tin [0,1] without loss of generality. Within this interval, f(t) is monotonically increasing because each term in the expanded form of f(t) increases as t increases from 0 to 1. 4. **Finding the Range of f(t)**: - The minimum value of f(t) occurs at t=0, which gives f(t)_{min }=f(0)=2. - The maximum value of f(t) occurs at t=1, which gives f(t)_{max}=f(1)={2}^{2023}. 5. **Conclusion**: The range of the function y=left(1+cos xright)^{2023}+left(1-cos xright)^{2023}, given x∈[-frac{2π}{3},frac{2π}{3}], is therefore [2,2^{2023}].

This process involves manipulating the equation to isolate a perfect square trinomial on one side. Starting with the given equation: [y = -3x^2 - 6x] We factor out the coefficient of x^2 from the first two terms: [y = -3(x^2 + 2x)] To complete the square, we add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of x, which is (2/2)^2 = 1, inside the parenthesis. However, since we are factoring out -3, we add -3 cdot 1 inside the parenthesis and add 3 outside to keep the equation balanced: [y = -3(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 3] This simplifies to: [y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3] Now, to find the focus of the parabola, we consider the general form of a parabola and the fact that the focus is equidistant from any point on the parabola to the directrix. For a parabola described by y = -3x^2, the focus is along the axis of symmetry, which in this case is the y-axis, so the focus has the form (0, f). Let's consider a point (x, -3x^2) on the parabola y = -3x^2 and denote the focus by (0, f) and the directrix by y = d. The distance squared from a point (x, -3x^2) on the parabola to the focus (0, f) is given by: [PF^2 = x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2] Similarly, the distance squared from the point to the directrix y = d is: [PQ^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2] Since the point is equidistant from the focus and the directrix, we have: [x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2] Expanding and simplifying both sides, we obtain: [x^2 + 9x^4 + 6fx^2 + f^2 = 9x^4 + 6dx^2 + d^2] Matching coefficients, we find that: begin{align*} 1 + 6f &= 6d, f^2 &= d^2. end{align*} From the first equation, we can solve for d - f = frac{1}{6}. Given that f^2 = d^2, it implies f = d or f = -d. Since f cannot equal d (as they are on opposite sides of the parabola), we conclude f = -d. Substituting this into -2f = frac{1}{6}, we solve for f to get f = -frac{1}{12}. Therefore, the focus of the parabola y = -3x^2 is at (0, -frac{1}{12}). To adjust for the shifts applied to the original parabola y = -3x^2 - 6x, we shift the focus left by 1 unit and up by 3 units, resulting in the focus of the given parabola being at boxed{left( -1, frac{35}{12} right)}."},{"prompt":"Let h ge 3 be an integer and X the set of all positive integers that are greater than or equal to 2h .

The latter indicates that although the shapes of plane triangles can vary greatly, the sum of their three interior angles remains constant. The following statements are about invariants: (1) For a parallelogram ABCD with fixed side lengths, when point A changes, the sum of any pair of opposite angles remains constant; (2) As the number of sides of a polygon increases, the sum of its exterior angles remains constant; (3) When △ABC rotates around vertex A, the sizes of its interior angles remain unchanged; (4) When observing a figure with an angle α under a magnifying glass, the size of angle α remains unchanged as the figure is magnified; (5) When the radius of a circle changes, the ratio of the circle's circumference to its radius remains constant; (6) When the radius of a circle changes, the ratio of the circle's circumference to its area remains constant.

Show that it is possible to draw ( n ) nonintersecting line segments, each connecting a blue point to a red point, in such a way that each point is used exactly once.","completion":"1. **Initial Step and Base Case:** We begin by reasoning through strong induction on ( n ). - **Base Case ( n = 1 ):** For ( n = 1 ), the problem states that we have 2 points, one blue and one red. Connecting these two points with a single segment trivially satisfies the conditions of the problem. Thus, the statement holds for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Suppose that for some ( n geq 1 ), the statement is true for all values ( k ) where ( 1 le k < n ). This means that if we have ( k ) blue points and ( k ) red points with ( 1 le k < n ), it is possible to draw ( k ) non-intersecting segments each connecting a blue point to a red point. 3. **Inductive Step:** We need to prove that the statement holds for ( n ). - Consider ( n ) blue points and ( n ) red points in the plane, ensuring no three points are collinear. 4. **Convex Hull Argument:** - Take the convex hull of the ( 2n ) points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all ( 2n ) points. - **Case 1: Convex Hull Contains Two Points of Different Colors:** If there are two consecutive points ( B ) and ( R ) on the convex hull's boundary that are of different colors (say ( B ) is blue and ( R ) is red), we can connect them with a segment ( overline{BR} ). This segment will be part of the convex hull and thus will not intersect any other segment inside the convex hull. This effectively reduces the problem to ( n - 1 ), to which the inductive hypothesis can be applied. - **Case 2: All Points on the Convex Hull are the Same Color:** Suppose all points on the convex hull are blue. Let's arrange the points such that any straight horizontal line passing through these points will cross exactly one point at each level (no two points share the same y-coordinate). - As we draw a horizontal line from top to bottom, eventually, the highest point ( A_{1} ) (which is blue) and the lowest point ( A_{2n} ) (which is also blue) will be crossed. - Once the line passes just below ( A_{1} ), there will be one extra blue point in the upper half above the line. - Conversely, right before the line reaches ( A_{2n} ), an extra red point must have appeared in the lower half below the line. During this process, there must be a position where the number of blue points equals the number of red points on either side of the horizontal line. We can now split the set of ( 2n ) points into two subsets each containing equal numbers of blue and red points by this line, ensuring that no two points of the same subset lie on opposite sides of the line. 5. **Application of the Inductive Hypothesis:** - Now, each subset of ( n ) points on either side fulfills the condition of having equal numbers of blue and red points. By the inductive hypothesis, we can apply the result recursively to each subset. - This will give us ( n ) non-crossing segments within each subset that satisfy the problem conditions. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that the statement holds for any ( n geq 1 ). Thus, it is always possible to draw ( n ) non-intersecting segments each connecting a blue point to a red point, using each point exactly once.

Now, we know that the expansion will have n + 1 = 9 terms, and by using the symmetric property of binomial coefficients, the middle term when n is an even number will have the greatest binomial coefficient. Therefore, the 5th term will have the maximum binomial coefficient since the terms are symmetric about the middle. The 5th term, T_5, is given by: T_5 = binom{8}{4}(3x)^{8-4} left(-frac{1}{3x}right)^4 = binom{8}{4} cdot 3^4 cdot x^4 cdot left(-frac{1}{3}right)^4 cdot x^{-4}.

Simplifying, we get: T_{r+1} = binom{8}{r} cdot 3^{8-r} cdot (-1)^{r} cdot 3^{-r} cdot x^{8-2r}. For T_{r+1} to be a constant term, the power of x must be zero: 8 - 2r = 0, Solving for r yields: r = 4. Now, we can determine the constant term, which is T_{4+1} = T_5: T_5 = binom{8}{4} cdot 3^{8-4} cdot (-1)^4 cdot 3^{-4} = binom{8}{4} cdot 3^{4} cdot 3^{-4}, which simplifies to: T_5 = binom{8}{4} cdot 1 = 70.

To maximize the price of the most expensive product, we should minimize the price of the other 14 products (while keeping them at 1,000 or more). If we set the price of each of these 14 products at exactly 1,000, the total price for these 14 products would be: 14 products * 1,000/product = 14,000 Now, we subtract this amount from the 26,000 to find the greatest possible selling price for the most expensive product: 26,000 - 14,000 = 12,000 Therefore, the greatest possible selling price of the most expensive product is boxed{12,000} ."},{"prompt":"Solve the system of equations: left{begin{array}{l}{x+3y=2}{4xy=8}end{array}right.

The teachers distinguish the children but do not distinguish the trees: two configurations are considered identical if one can be converted into the other by swapping the trees (along with the corresponding groups) or by rotating each group around its tree. In how many ways can the children be divided into groups?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We have 5 children and 2 identical trees (with corresponding identical circles around them). We need to partition the children into two groups where each group has at least one child, and the circles around the trees can be rearranged with respect to each other. 2. **Number of Ways to Partition the Children into Two Non-Empty Groups:** We need to count the ways to partition the 5 children into two non-empty groups. We use the binomial coefficient and sum the relevant terms: [ text{Total ways} = binom{5}{1} + binom{5}{2} + binom{5}{3} + binom{5}{4} ] Calculating each term: [ binom{5}{1} = 5 ] [ binom{5}{2} = 10 ] [ binom{5}{3} = 10 ] [ binom{5}{4} = 5 ] So, the total number of ways to partition is: [ 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30 ] 3. **Correcting for Identical Trees:** Each partition of children can be divided between two circles in two equivalent ways since the circles are identical. Thus, we have counted each arrangement twice. Therefore, we divide by 2: [ frac{30}{2} = 15 ] 4. **Arranging the Children around the Trees in a Circle:** Each group of children around a tree can form a circle. For a group of size ( k ), the number of unique circular arrangements is ((k-1)!). Considering all possible group sizes again: - For a group of size ( k ), the other group has ( 5-k ). The product of arrangements around both trees must be considered as: [ (k-1)! times (5-k-1)! ] Now we sum the arrangements for each partition: - For partition (1, 4): [ 0! times 3! = 1 times 6 = 6 ] - For partition (2, 3): [ 1! times 2! = 1 times 2 = 2 ] - For partition (3, 2): [ 2! times 1! = 2 times 1 = 2 ] - For partition (4, 1): [ 3! times 0! = 6 times 1 = 6 ] This summing: [ 6 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 16 ] 5. **Multiplying by Number of Partitions:** Each of the 15 partitions can be arranged in those 16 different ways: [ 15 times 16 = 240 ] However, this number still requires negotiation about rotations and the fact that they can swap around: As stated in the initial steps, the rotations are unique for each set due to the nondistinguishable trees, meaning the factor 2 should have been factored in still higher.

Step 1: Representation of the Sums Let's denote the numbers in the sequence as (a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{15}). Consider the sums of three consecutive numbers and four consecutive numbers: - The sum of three consecutive numbers: (a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2}) - The sum of four consecutive numbers: (a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + a_{i+3}) Step 2: Summation Conditions for Positivity and Negativity Given the conditions: - The sum of any three consecutive numbers is positive: [ a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} > 0 quad forall , 1 leq i leq 13 ] - The sum of any four consecutive numbers is negative: [ a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + a_{i+3} < 0 quad forall , 1 leq i leq 12 ] Step 3: Deriving Consequences from the Conditions Let's analyze the implications of these conditions. Firstly, consider the sums of groups of three consecutive numbers: - (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 > 0) - (a_2 + a_3 + a_4 > 0) - (a_3 + a_4 + a_5 > 0) - ... If we add up the sums of the four sets of three consecutive numbers (specifically from (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) to (a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{14})): [ (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + (a_2 + a_3 + a_4) + cdots + (a_{12} + a_{13} + a_{14}) > 0 ] This summation includes (a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{13}) three times and each of (a_1, a_{14}, a_{15}) once: [ 3(a_2 + a_3 + cdots + a_{13}) + a_1 + a_{14} + a_{15} > 0 ] Step 4: Contradiction with Sum of Four Consecutive Numbers Now, consider four sets of consecutive numbers: - (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 < 0) - (a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 < 0) - ... Adding these inequalities up (specifically from (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) to (a_{9} + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12})): [ (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4) + (a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5) + cdots + (a_9 + a_{10} + a_{11} + a_{12}) < 0 ] This sum includes (a_2, a_3, cdots, a_{11}) three times and each of (a_1, a_{4}, a_{8}, a_{12}) twice: [ (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{12}) < 0 ] Conclusion We have summed all numbers from both conditions, revealing an inconsistency. If the sum of any three consecutive numbers is positive and the sum of any four consecutive numbers is negative, adding all such sums shows that positive sums and negative sums overlap in a range where a solution is not possible due to their conflicting nature.

Expanding (2z+b)^2 gives us: [ (2z+b)^2 = 4z^2 + 4bz + b^2 ] Comparing this with our original quadratic expression, we see that 4bz should be equal to -20z, which implies that b = -5.

Using induction, we find that (Q_{(n+1)(i+1)} = Q_{ni}Q_{n(i+1)}) has length: [ binom{n-1}{i-1} + binom{n-1}{i} = binom{n}{i} ] as needed. (blacksquare) 3. **Define Operation**: For any finite sequence (A = (x_1, x_2, dots, x_n)) (where all the (x_i) are positive integers), define the operation: [ hat{A} = (1, 2, dots, x_1, 1, 2, dots, x_2, dots, 1, 2, dots, x_n) ] Then, of course, we have (hat{A}hat{B} = hat{AB}). 4. **Claim 2**: (Q_{ni} = hat{Q_{(n-1)i}}) for (n ge 2) and (1 le i le n-1). - **Proof**: We use induction on (n). This is trivial for (i = 1) because (Q_{n1} = Q_{(n-1)1} = (1)). This also implies the truth of the claim for (n = 2). For (n > 2), (1 < i < n), we find by the induction hypothesis: [ Q_{ni} = Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}Q_{(n-1)i} = hat{Q_{(n-2)(i-1)}}hat{Q_{(n-2)i}} = hat{Q_{(n-1)i}} ] (blacksquare) 5. **Claim 3**: The (j)-th term from the left in (Q_{ni}) is a 1 if and only if the (j)-th term from the right in (Q_{n(n+1-i)}) is not a 1 ((n ge 2)). - **Proof**: Inducting on (n), starting from the trivial (n = 2), we note that either (i = 1) or (i = n), in which case we are done based on the definition, or else we have (Q_{ni} = Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}Q_{(n-1)i}) and (Q_{n(n+1-i)} = Q_{(n-1)(n-i)}Q_{(n-1)(n+1-i)}). In the latter case, the (j)-th term from the left in (Q_{ni}) is either in the part (Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}), or it is in (Q_{(n-1)i}). Because of Claim 1, we notice that (Q_{(n-1)(n+1-i)}) is just as long as (Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}), so the (j)-th term from the left in (Q_{ni}) and the (j)-th term from the right in (Q_{n(n+1-i)}) coincide with either the (j)-th term from the left in (Q_{(n-1)(i-1)}) and from the right in (Q_{(n-1)(n+i-1)}), or the (j^*)-th term (for some (j^*)) from the left in (Q_{(n-1)i}) and from the right in (Q_{(n-1)(n-i)}). In both cases, we are done because of the induction hypothesis. (blacksquare) 6. **Claim 4**: (R_n = Q_{n1}Q_{n2}dots Q_{nn}). - **Proof**: This is trivial for (n = 1). Proceeding by induction and using the definition of (R_n) and also Claim 2, we see that: [ R_n = hat{R_{n-1}}Q_{nn} = hat{Q_{(n-1)1}}hat{Q_{(n-1)2}}dotshat{Q_{(n-1)(n-1)}}Q_{nn} = Q_{n1}Q_{n2}dots Q_{n(n-1)}Q_{nn} ] (blacksquare) 7. **Final Step**: Now take the (k)-th term from the right in (R_n). Using the identity of Claim 4, we see that this is inside some sequence (Q_{ni}), at place number (j) (from the left). Because of Claim 1, this implies: [ k = binom{n-1}{0} + binom{n-1}{1} + dots + binom{n-1}{i-2} + j = binom{n-1}{n-1} + binom{n-1}{n-2} + dots + binom{n-1}{n+1-i} + j ] Hence, using Claim 1 again, we find that the (k)-th term from the right in (R_n) is none other than the (j)-th term from the right in (Q_{n(n+1-i)}). By Claim 3, this implies the statement of the problem.

This is true if: 0 < (2l - 1)p^k leq 2n implies frac{1}{2} < l leq frac{n}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} implies 1 leq l leq leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor. 8. Thus, there are exactly (m_k = leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor) terms in the set divisible by (p^k). Therefore, v_p((2n - 1)!!) = sum_{i=1}^n v_p(2i - 1) = sum_{i=1}^n sum_{k=1}^{v_p(2i - 1)} 1 = sum_{k=1}^infty sum_{l=1}^{m_k} 1 = sum_{k=1}^infty leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor. 9. Returning to the original problem, set (N = frac{(2a + 2b - 1)!!}{(2a - 1)!! cdot (2b - 1)!!}). 10. Clearly, (N > 1). Thus, there exists an odd prime (p) such that (v_p(N) > 0). 11. Since both numerator and denominator of (N) in the factorial product form are odd, (p) is an odd prime. By the lemma, we derive: 0 < v_p(N) = sum_{k=1}^infty left(leftlfloor frac{a + b}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{a}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{b}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloorright). 12. Therefore, there exists a positive integer (k) such that: d_k = leftlfloor frac{a + b}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{a}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{b}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor geq 1. 13. Using the floor function approximation, we have: leftlfloor frac{a + b}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = frac{a + b}{p^k} pm left|frac{a + b}{p^k}right|, making 1 leq d_k = leftlfloor frac{a + b}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{a}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{b}{p^k} + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = pm left| frac{a + b}{p^k} right| pm left| frac{a}{p^k} right| pm left| frac{b}{p^k} right|. 14. Since for any rational number (x) with an odd denominator, (|x| < frac{1}{2}), the only possibility for the inequality to hold is when all three terms are positive and: left| frac{a}{p^k} right| + left| frac{b}{p^k} right| + left| frac{a + b}{p^k} right| = 1. 15. Hence, we conclude that: boxed{left| frac{a}{p^k} right| + left| frac{b}{p^k} right| + left| frac{a + b}{p^k} right| = 1.}"},{"prompt":"f john makes a contribution to a charity fund at school , the average contribution size will increase by 50 % reaching 75 per person . if there were 3 other contributions made before john ' s , what is the size of his donation ?","completion":"Let's call the size of John's donation \\"J\\" and the average contribution size before his donation \\"A\\".

By definition, we know that {A}_{n}^{2} = n(n-1) since there are n ways to choose the first element and n-1 ways to choose the second, without repetition. For combinations, {C}_{n+1}^{2} = frac{(n+1)n}{2} because we're choosing 2 elements out of n+1 without considering the order, and thus we divide by 2! to account for the repetition in arrangement. Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get: n(n-1) = frac{(n+1)n}{2}. To solve for n, we multiply both sides by 2 to clear the denominator: 2n(n-1) = (n+1)n. Expanding both sides gives: 2n^2 - 2n = n^2 + n. Rearranging the terms to bring them all to one side: 2n^2 - n^2 - 2n - n = 0, which simplifies to: n^2 - 3n = 0.

Since they start 20 miles apart, we can calculate the time it will take for them to collide by dividing the distance by their combined speed: Time to collide = Distance / Combined Speed Time to collide = 20 miles / 24 miles/hr To convert the speed to miles per minute, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 24 miles/hr ÷ 60 = 0.4 miles/minute Now, we can calculate the time to collide in minutes: Time to collide = 20 miles / 0.4 miles/minute Time to collide = 50 minutes Now, we want to find out how far apart they are one minute before they collide.

Therefore, we can write the equation: Sheila's share + Purity's share + Rose's share = Total rent 5P + P + 1,800 = 5,400 Combining Purity's share, we get: 6P + 1,800 = 5,400 Now, we subtract 1,800 from both sides to solve for P: 6P = 5,400 - 1,800 6P = 3,600 Divide both sides by 6 to find Purity's share: P = 3,600 / 6 P = 600 Now we have Purity's share (P) as 600 and Rose's share as 1,800. To find the ratio of Rose's share to Purity's share, we divide Rose's share by Purity's share: Ratio = Rose's share / Purity's share Ratio = 1,800 / 600 Ratio = 3 / 1 Therefore, the ratio of Rose's share to Purity's share is boxed{3:1} ."},{"prompt":"Bruce can make 15 batches of pizza dough using a sack of flour.

Since (2 + i)(2 - i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5, and (-1 - 3i)(2 - i) = -2 + i + 6i -3i^2 = -2 + 7i + 3 = 1 + 7i, the fraction simplifies to: frac{-1 - 3i}{2 + i} = frac{1 + 7i}{5} = frac{1}{5} + frac{7i}{5} = frac{1}{5}(1 + 7i). However, further simplification reveals that: frac{1 + 7i}{5} = frac{1}{5} + frac{7}{5}i = frac{1}{5}(1 + 7i) = 0.2 + 1.4i = -1 - i. Now that we have the simplified form of the complex number in set N, we can find the elements of M+N as follows: - 0 + 0 = 0 - (1+i) + 0 = 1 + i - 0 + (-1-i) = -1 - i - (1+i) + (-1-i) = 1 - 1 + i - i = 0 After simplifying, the elements of the set M+N are {0, 1+i, -1-i}. However, we note that 0 appears twice, so we only count it once. Therefore, M+N has 3 distinct elements. Thus, the correct answer is boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"vartriangle ABC has side lengths AB = 4 and AC = 9 . Angle bisector AD bisects angle A and intersects BC at D . Let k be the ratio frac{BD}{AB} .

Given the triangle ( triangle ABC ) with side lengths ( AB = 4 ) and ( AC = 9 ), and the angle bisector ( AD ) intersecting ( BC ) at ( D ), we need to find the sum of all possible values of ( k^2 ) where ( k = frac{BD}{AB} ). 2. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have: [ frac{BD}{DC} = frac{AB}{AC} = frac{4}{9} ] Let ( BD = 4k ) and ( DC = 9k ). Therefore, the length of ( BC ) is: [ BC = BD + DC = 4k + 9k = 13k ] 3. Applying the triangle inequality: [ AB + BC > AC implies 4 + 13k > 9 implies 13k > 5 implies k > frac{5}{13} ] [ AB + AC > BC implies 4 + 9 > 13k implies 13 > 13k implies k < 1 ] Thus, we have: [ frac{5}{13} < k < 1 ] 4.

Since ( AD ) is an integer, let ( AD = 6m ) where ( m ) is a rational number. Then: [ 6m = 6sqrt{1 - k^2} ] [ m = sqrt{1 - k^2} ] Given ( frac{5}{13} < k < 1 ), we have ( 1 > k^2 > frac{25}{169} ). Therefore: [ 1 > 1 - k^2 > frac{144}{169} ] [ 1 > sqrt{1 - k^2} > frac{12}{13} ] 6. The possible values for ( m ) in the range ( frac{12}{13} > m > 0 ) that are rational and make ( AD ) an integer are: [ m = frac{5}{6}, frac{2}{3}, frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{3}, frac{1}{6} ] 7.

To simplify this equation, let's isolate the term involving the root. Add (1) to both sides to get: [ 2021x + 1 = 2022 cdot sqrt[2022]{x^{2021}} ] 4. Consider that (sqrt[2022]{x^{2021}} = x^{2021/2022}). Substituting this back into the equation, we have: [ 2021x + 1 = 2022 cdot x^{2021/2022} ] 5.

To verify that this is the only solution, consider the theorem or property of the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality for (n) numbers. AM-GM states that for non-negative numbers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n): [ frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n}{n} geq sqrt[n]{a_1 cdot a_2 cdot cdots cdot a_n} ] with equality if and only if (a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_n). 8. In our context, consider: [ 2021x + 1 = 2022 x^{2021/2022} ] The AM-GM applied to (2021x) terms and one (1) term confirms that (x=1) is the equality case. 9.

Does Person A have a guaranteed winning strategy?","completion":"1. **Initialization**: Consider a quadratic equation with real roots x_1 and x_2, [ x^2 + p x + q = 0 ] The quadratic can be factored using its roots: [ (x - x_1)(x - x_2) = 0 Rightarrow x^2 - (x_1 + x_2)x + x_1 x_2 = 0 ] Therefore, the coefficients can be expressed as ( p = -(x_1 + x_2) ) and ( q = x_1 x_2 ). 2. **Jia's Strategy**: Jia modifies the constant term ( q ) by subtracting the smaller real root ( x_1 ) and adds 1 to the linear coefficient ( p ): [ x^2 + (p + 1)x + (q - x_1) = x^2 - (x_1 + x_2 - 1)x + x_1 x_2 - x_1 = 0 ] The new roots of this quadratic will be ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 - 1 ). 3. **Yi's Strategy**: Yi has two options: - Change the constant term ( q ) to any real number and subtract 1 from the linear coefficient ( p ), or - Increase the constant term ( q ) by the larger real root ( x_2 ) and subtract 1 from the linear coefficient ( p ): [ x^2 + (p - 1)x + (q + x_2) = x^2 - (x_1 + x_2 + 1)x + x_1 x_2 + x_2 = 0 ] The new roots of this quadratic would be ( x_1 + 1 ) and ( x_2 ). 4. **Analysis**: We need to prove that Yi will be forced to choose the first option (as subtracting 1 from the larger root) after a finite number of moves. - If Yi continually picks the second option, the difference ( x_2 - x_1 ) would remain unchanged, but ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) would approach each other eventually, making it impossible for ( x_2 - x_1 ) to exceed 1 in perpetuity. Then, Jia's move makes ( p ) increase by 1 and would force Yi to choose the first option once their difference becomes 1. 5. **Jia’s Win**: Following Jia's strategy, after a finite number of moves with ( p ) becoming too large, Yi will end up driving one of the roots or the coefficient ( p ) to non-positive, indicating a loss for Yi. # Conclusion Jia always has a winning strategy by continuously modifying the constant term by subtracting the smaller root and adding 1 to the linear coefficient. This forces Yi to ultimately be unable to keep the roots within the allowed parameters, proving that Jia will always win given these rules.

The company wants to spend an equal amount of money on both types of printers, so we can set up the following equation: 350x = 200y To find the fewest number of printers, we need to find the smallest values of x and y that satisfy this equation. We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor of 350 and 200, which is 50: 7x = 4y Now we need to find the smallest integer values of x and y that satisfy this equation. Since 7 and 4 are relatively prime (they have no common divisors other than 1), the smallest values for x and y that satisfy the equation are multiples of 4 and 7, respectively. So, the fewest number of 350 printers (x) the company can purchase is 4, and the fewest number of 200 printers (y) is 7.

David has scheduled two hours for each client on different days of the week. On Monday, he mows the 14 per hour lawn; on Wednesday, he mows the 18 per hour lawn; and on Friday, he mows the 20 per hour lawn. After a week of mowing lawns, David deposits his earnings into a savings account yielding an interest rate of 2% annually. A month later, David decided to buy a pair of shoes on sale with a 15% discount. The original price of the shoes was 75. He then gives a third of the remaining amount after purchasing the shoes to his mom. Moreover, David also has to pay a 10% tax on his earnings from mowing lawns. How much money does he have left in his savings account after settling all his expenses, taxes, and the gift to his mom?","completion":"Let's calculate David's earnings from mowing lawns for a week first: For the 14 per hour lawn, he earns 14 * 2 = 28. For the 18 per hour lawn, he earns 18 * 2 = 36. For the 20 per hour lawn, he earns 20 * 2 = 40. Total earnings for the week = 28 + 36 + 40 = 104. Since he deposits this amount into a savings account yielding an interest rate of 2% annually, we need to calculate the interest earned in a month. However, since interest is typically compounded annually and a month is a short period, the interest earned in one month would be very small and not significant for this calculation (1/12th of 2% of 104, which is a few cents). For simplicity, we will not include this small interest amount in our calculation. Next, let's calculate the tax David has to pay on his earnings: Tax = 10% of 104 = 0.10 * 104 = 10.40. Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes with the 15% discount: Discounted price of shoes = Original price - (15% of original price) Discounted price of shoes = 75 - (0.15 * 75) Discounted price of shoes = 75 - 11.25 Discounted price of shoes = 63.75. After buying the shoes, David gives a third of the remaining amount to his mom: Remaining amount after buying shoes = 104 - 10.40 (tax) - 63.75 (shoes) Remaining amount after buying shoes = 93.60 - 63.75 Remaining amount after buying shoes = 29.85. Amount given to mom = 1/3 of 29.85 = 29.85 / 3 Amount given to mom = 9.95. Finally, let's calculate how much money David has left in his savings account: Money left after all expenses = Remaining amount after buying shoes - Amount given to mom Money left after all expenses = 29.85 - 9.95 Money left after all expenses = 19.90.

Найдите наименьшее возможное число пар друзей, один из которых рыцарь, а другой - лжец. Solution: 1. **Define Variable and Assumption:** - Let’s denote knights as K_1, K_2, ldots, K_{100} and liars as L_1, L_2, ldots, L_{100}. 2. **Possible Statements and Their Truth:** - Each knight tells the truth, so if a knight says \\"Все мои друзья - рыцари\\", then all of this knight's friends must indeed be knights. - Conversely, if a knight says \\"Все мои друзья - лжецы\\", this must be false since knights cannot be friends with all liars. Hence, this statement must have been made by someone who knows at least one liar. - Liars always lie, so if a liar says \\"Все мои друзья - рыцари\\", it must mean there is at least one liar among their friends. Similarly, if a liar says \\"Все мои друзья - лжецы\\", this must be false, so there is at least one knight among their friends. 3. **Analysis of Friend Pairs:** - If at least 50 knights say \\"Все мои друзья - лжецы\\", then each of these knights must know at least one liar. Therefore, there are at least 50 knight-liar friend pairs. - Similarly, if at least 50 liars say \\"Все мои друзья - лжецы\\", this must be false, so each of these liars know at least one knight. Hence again, there will be at least 50 knight-liar friend pairs. 4. **Constructing a Scenario with Exact Number of Friend Pairs:** - Assume knight K_1 is friends only with liar L_1, knight K_2 is friends only with liar L_2, and this continues up to knight K_{50} being friends only with liar L_{50}. - Knights K_{51}, K_{52}, ldots, K_{100} are friends with each other only, and similarly, liars L_{51}, L_{52}, ldots, L_{100} are friends among themselves only. - In this case, there would be exactly 50 knight-liar friend pairs: {(K_1, L_1), (K_2, L_2), ldots, K_{50}, L_{50}}. - This configuration ensures the statements: the first 50 knights would say \\"Все мои друзья - лжецы\\", and the remaining 50 make the opposite statement. Among the liars, the first 50 would say \\"Все мои друзья - рыцари\\", and the others will assert the opposite. 5. **Conclusion:** - Hence, the minimum number of knight-liar pairs possible is exactly 50.

Given that we have 3 moles of NaOH and 2 moles of H2SO4, we can calculate how much Na2SO4 will be produced by each reactant. From NaOH: Since 2 moles of NaOH produce 1 mole of Na2SO4, 3 moles of NaOH would theoretically produce 3/2 = 1.5 moles of Na2SO4. From H2SO4: Since 1 mole of H2SO4 produces 1 mole of Na2SO4, 2 moles of H2SO4 would theoretically produce 2 moles of Na2SO4. Since NaOH would produce less Na2SO4 than H2SO4, NaOH is the limiting reactant in this step. Therefore, the maximum amount of Na2SO4 that can be produced is 1.5 moles. **Step 2: Reaction between Na2SO4 and BaCl2** The balanced equation is: Na2SO4 + BaCl2 → BaSO4 + 2 NaCl From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Na2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of BaCl2 to produce 1 mole of BaSO4. Given that we have 1.5 moles of Na2SO4 (from step 1) and 1 mole of BaCl2, we can determine the limiting reactant. Since we have more Na2SO4 than BaCl2, BaCl2 is the limiting reactant in this step. Therefore, the maximum amount of BaSO4 that can be produced is 1 mole, as we only have 1 mole of BaCl2. **Calculating the Percentage Yield** The percentage yield is calculated using the actual yield (the amount of product actually obtained) and the theoretical yield (the amount of product that could be formed based on the limiting reactant). Theoretical yield of BaSO4 = 1 mole (since BaCl2 is the limiting reactant) Actual yield of BaSO4 = 0.9 moles Percentage yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100 Percentage yield = (0.9 moles / 1 mole) × 100 Percentage yield = 0.9 × 100 Percentage yield = 90% Therefore, the percentage yield of BaSO4 is boxed{90%} ."},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=( sqrt {3}sin x,sin x), overrightarrow{b}=(cos x,sin x), where xin(0, frac {π}{2}).

This makes a total of 7 cubes. ![Figure 1](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_cd020beb15a61daf83d7g-1.jpg?height=260&width=265&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=911) 2. **Dividing and Organizing the Space**: To fill the space completely with these shapes, we first fill the space with identical cubes. We then group these cubes in sets of seven, organizing them to match the shape shown in Figure 1. 3. **Horizontal Layer Analysis**: Consider a horizontal layer of these cubes. In this layer, the intersections of the cubes with the plane create a grid of squares. For each shape from Figure 1 intersecting the plane, five cubes will be cut by the plane forming cross shapes as shown in Figure 2. ![Figure 2](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_cd020beb15a61daf83d7g-1.jpg?height=307&width=326&top_left_y=947&top_left_x=886) 4. **Examining Neighbors**: Additionally, the plane intersects single cubes from neighboring shapes whose central cube lies either above or below the plane. These intersections are marked F if above and A if below. Thus, the plane is filled with cross shapes (K) and single unit squares (F and A). 5. **Uniform Distribution**: Since the centers of the shapes are evenly distributed in each layer, the K, A, and F shapes also distribute uniformly. To ensure that each K shape from Figure 1 is surrounded by six other identical shapes, let's examine if this structuring can be extended to fill the entire space. 6. **Continuing the Pattern**: To propagate this structuring through all layers and ensure every cube is part of one of these shapes, we must find a repeating pattern of centers: ![Figure 3](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_cd020beb15a61daf83d7g-1.jpg?height=241&width=1065&top_left_y=1820&top_left_x=514) 7. **Building Layers**: Label rows such that the first layer contains the centers as illustrated.

Therefore, the domain of this equation is: [ [10^{-100}, +infty) ] 3. **Function Transformation:** Let ( P(x) = x^2 - sqrt{log x + 100} ). We need to analyze where ( P(x) = 0 ) by studying the behavior of ( P(x) ). 4. **Sign Analysis of ( P(x) ):** We evaluate ( P(x) ) at some specific points within the domain: * ( P(10^{-100}) = (10^{-100})^2 - sqrt{log 10^{-100} + 100} = 10^{-200} - sqrt{-200 + 100} > 0 ) because ( sqrt{-100} ) is undefined. * ( P(1) = 1 - sqrt{log 1 + 100} = 1 - sqrt{100} = 1 - 10 < 0 ) * ( P(0.1) = (0.1)^2 - sqrt{log 0.1 + 100} = 0.01 - sqrt{-1 + 100} = 0.01 - sqrt{99} approx 0.01 - 9.95 < 0 ) From this, we see ( P(x) ) changes sign between ( 10^{-100} ) and 1, suggesting the root lies in the interval ( [10^{-100}, 1) ). 5. **Equivalence to Another Form:** Rewrite the original equation as: [ x^4 = log x + 100 ] Define ( M(x) = x^4 ) and ( F(x) = log x + 100 ). 6. **Derivative Analysis:** To understand the behavior of these functions, we compute their derivatives: [ M'(x) = 4x^3 ] [ F'(x) = frac{1}{x ln 10} ] We compare ( M'(x) ) and ( F'(x) ): * For ( 10^{-100} < x < 0.1 ), we analyze that ( M'(x) < F'(x) ).

If (d geq 2), we can find an odd prime divisor (p) of (7^d + 1). Note that (7^d + 1) is not divisible by (16) when (d geq 2), and it is larger than (16), so it is not a power of (2). Hence, such a prime (p) exists. - Set (a = 7) and (b = p + 7). Then, (a^s + b^t equiv 7^s + 7^t equiv 0 pmod{p}), implying (p mid a^n + b^{n+1} equiv 7^n cdot 8 pmod{p}). - Since (p neq 7), (7^n cdot 8 equiv 0 pmod{p}) is impossible.

If (p mid a, b), for all (n geq r), (p^r mid a^n + b^{n+1}). - Suppose (p) is coprime to (a) and (b). Since (1 equiv a^{varphi(p^r)} equiv b^{varphi(p^r)} pmod{p^r}), for all integers (l), (a^{l varphi(p^r) - t - 1} equiv -b^{l varphi(p^r) - t} pmod{p^r}). - Thus, for that particular prime divisor, all (n) such that (varphi(p^r) mid n + t + 1) satisfy the condition. - We can choose (n = u varphi(a^{t+1} + b^t) - t - 1) for (u) sufficiently large to make (n) larger than all the exponents of prime divisors of (a^{t+1} + b^t).

Constructing the Function: We begin by defining the fractional part ({x}) of any rational number (x) as follows: [ {x} = x - lfloor x rfloor, ] where ( lfloor x rfloor ) is the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x ). Next, we introduce two sets: - ( Q subset mathbf{Q} ): The set of all rationals whose denominator (in lowest terms) is a power of 2. - ( R subset mathbf{Q} ): The set of all rationals whose denominator (in lowest terms) is an odd number. # Fundamental Lemma: For any rational number (x), it can be represented in the form ( x = q + r ) where ( q in Q ) and ( r in R ). Moreover, if ( x = q + r = q' + r' ) (with ( q, q' in Q ) and ( r, r' in R )), then ( q - q' ) is an integer. Proof of Fundamental Lemma: Let ( x = frac{m}{n} ) where ( m ) and ( n ) are coprime integers. Suppose ( n ) can be written as ( n = 2^a n_2 ) where ( n_2 ) is odd. Since ( 2^a ) and ( n_2 ) are coprime, there exist integers ( a, b ) such that ( a cdot 2^a + b cdot n_2 = 1 ). Define: [ q = frac{m b}{2^a}, quad r = frac{m a}{n_2}, ] then ( q in Q ), ( r in R ), and [ q + r = frac{m b}{2^a} + frac{m a}{n_2} = frac{m (a cdot 2^a + b cdot n_2)}{2^a cdot n_2} = frac{m}{n} = x. ] If ( x = q + r = q' + r' ) with ( q, q' in Q ) and ( r, r' in R ), then: [ q - q' = r' - r. ] Since ( q - q' in Q ) and ( r' - r in R ), it follows that ( q - q' ) is a rational number whose denominator (in lowest terms) is both a power of 2 and an odd number, hence it must be an integer. # Function Definition: Define the function ( f ) by: [ f(x) = {q} text{ for } x = q + r text{ with } q in Q text{ and } r in R. ] By the above lemma, this definition is unique. # Verification of Condition: For any ( x, y in mathbf{Q} ), let: [ x = q_1 + r_1 text{ and } y = q_2 + r_2 text{ with } q_1, q_2 in Q text{ and } r_1, r_2 in R, ] then: [ x + y = (q_1 + q_2) + (r_1 + r_2) text{ where } q_1 + q_2 in Q text{ and } r_1 + r_2 in R. ] From the definition of ( f ): [ f(x) = { q_1 }, quad f(y) = { q_2 }, quad f(x + y) = { q_1 + q_2 }. ] Hence: [ f(x+y) - f(x) - f(y) = { q_1 + q_2 } - { q_1 } - { q_2 }, ] since ( {q_1 + q_2} = q_1 + q_2 - lfloor q_1 + q_2 rfloor ) and similar definitions for the rest, their difference is always an integer. # Existence of Constant ( c ): Suppose there exists ( c in mathbf{Q} ) such that ( f(x) - cx in mathbf{Z} ) for all ( x in mathbf{Q} ). Consider a fixed odd number ( l ) such that ( l > |c| ). Note ( frac{1}{l} ) can be written as: [ frac{1}{l} = 0 + frac{1}{l}, quad 0 in Q, quad frac{1}{l} in R. ] Hence: [ fleft(frac{1}{l}right) = 0. ] By assumption: [ fleft(frac{1}{l}right) - frac{c}{l} = -frac{c}{l} text{ is an integer} ] This implies: [ c = 0. ] Thus, ( f(x) in mathbf{Z} ). However, consider: [ frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} + 0, quad frac{1}{2} in Q, quad 0 in R. ] Then: [ fleft(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{1}{2}, ] creating a contradiction since ( frac{1}{2} notin mathbf{Z} ).

A: First quadrant B: Second quadrant C: Third quadrant D: Fourth quadr","completion":"To determine the quadrant where the intersection point of f(x) and g(x) lies, we need to analyze the behavior of both functions for a > 1. For f(x) = log_a x: - The domain is x > 0. - The graph passes through the point (1, 0) since log_a 1 = 0. - As x increases, f(x) increases slowly because log_a x is an increasing function when a > 1. For g(x) = (1 - a)x: - This is a linear function with a negative slope since a > 1 implies (1 - a) < 0. - The graph passes through the origin (0, 0). - As x increases, g(x) decreases because of the negative slope. Now we need to find where these two graphs intersect. We set f(x) = g(x) to find the x-coordinate of the intersection. log_a x = (1 - a)x quad Rightarrow quad xlog_a x = x(1 - a) The equation simplifies to x(log_a x + a - 1) = 0. The solutions of this equation are x = 0 or log_a x + a - 1 = 0. The first solution, x = 0, is not within the domain of f(x). Thus, we look at the second part: log_a x + a - 1 = 0 quad Rightarrow quad log_a x = 1 - a To further analyze the solution, we investigate the sign of the right-hand side, 1 - a. Since a > 1, 1 - a is negative. This implies that the solution x must also yield a negative value when plugged into log_a x, which is not possible since the domain of the logarithmic function is x > 0. Therefore, the intersection cannot occur in the first or second quadrant as x > 0 and f(x) > 0 would need to hold true for the first quadrant, and x < 0 and f(x) > 0 for the second quadrant - both of which are not possible for f(x) = log_a x.

After that, we will investigate its behavior on the interval left(0,+infty right). **Step 1: Domain of f(x)** The domain of f(x) is all real numbers except x = 0, because the logarithm function ln |x| is undefined at x = 0. Therefore, the domain is {x | x neq 0}. **Step 2: Symmetry of f(x)** To determine if f(x) is an even or odd function, we evaluate f(-x): begin{align*} f(-x) &= (-x)^{2} + ln |-x| &= x^{2} + ln |x| &= f(x) end{align*} Since f(-x) = f(x), f(x) is an even function, which means it is symmetric about the y-axis. **Step 3: Behavior on left(0,+infty right)** For x > 0, the function simplifies to f(x) = x^{2} + ln x.

This is a very restrictive condition. Consider a polygon with vertices labeled consecutively as ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ). For any side ( A_iA_{i+1} ), the straight line formed by extending this side must contain at least one more vertex ( A_j ) where ( j neq i, i+1 ). 2. **Implications of the property:** The property implies that the polygon must have collinear points. This means some of the vertices ( A_i ) lie on the same straight line formed by extending some side ( A_iA_{i+1} ). 3. **Example of such a polygon with fewer vertices:** Consider a polygon with vertices labeled as ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, A_8, ) and ( A_9 ). Suppose the vertices are positioned such that they satisfy the given property. For example, if three vertices are collinear at a time, we can form a non-convex polygon or a polygon with multiple collinear points. 4. **Analyzing the given figures:** The figures given illustrate potential configurations of such polygons. These diagrams or illustrations show how vertices can be arranged such that the property is satisfied. 5. **Conclusion:** Upon studying such configurations, we realize that the arrangement of vertices can indeed satisfy the condition even if the number of vertices does not exceed nine or even eight. Therefore, the polygon can have its number of vertices **not exceeding nine** and **not exceeding eight** while still adhering to the properties described. **Conclusion:** \`\`\` It is possible for the polygon to have vertices such that: a) the number of vertices does not exceed nine. b) the number of vertices does not exceed eight. \`\`\` Thus, the answer is: boxed{text{Yes, it can.}}"},{"prompt":"f the average of 744, 745, 747, 748, 749, some numbers, 753, 755 and x is 750, and the value of x is 755, what is the missing number?","completion":"To find the missing number, we first need to calculate the sum of the given numbers and then subtract it from the total sum that would give an average of 750.

Consider an inversion through ( B ) with radius (sqrt{AB cdot BC}) with reflection through the bisector of (angle ABC). Denote the inversion as a function (psi). Then (psi(A) = C) and vice versa, (psi(Gamma) = overline{AC}) and vice versa, and (psi(Omega)) is a line through (psi(L)) parallel to (AC). But we see that (psi(L) equiv L') reflected through the angle bisector of (angle B) and so (psi(L)) had to be the midpoint of the arc (AC) of (Gamma), and this implies that (BL) is the actual angle bisector of (angle B). 2. **Lemma 2:** ( L ) is the center of (odot MM_1M_2NN_1N_2). Lemma 1 tells us (M_1 in BC) and (N_1 in BA). Also, by the reflection conditions we get (LM = LM_1 = LM_2) and (LN = LN_1 = LN_2). Also by Lemma 1 we have (angle NBL = angle MBL implies LN = LM). Combining this with the previous equalities gives the result. 3. **Lemma 3:** ( B, N_1, M_1, K ) are concyclic. Since (NN_2 perp AC) and (MM_2 perp AC), we have (NN_2 parallel MM_2). Also, by the tangency condition we have (angle NLC = angle NBL = angle MBL = angle MLA), and this along with reflection gives (angle NLN_2 = angle MLM_2). Combining this with (NN_2 parallel MM_2) tells us (M, L, N_2) are collinear, as well as (N, L, M_2). Because (L) is the center of the circle given in Lemma 2, we have (MN_1 perp N_1N_2 implies angle KN_1B = pi/2) and (NM_1 perp M_1M_2 implies angle KM_1B = pi/2), which give the result. 4. **Lemma 4:** ( L in odot B, N_1, M_1, K ). (M_1NN_1M) is an isosceles trapezoid, so we have (M_1N_1 = MN = M_2N_2), where the last equality follows from reflecting (MN) through (L). Also (M_1N_2 parallel N_1M_2) because (M_1N_2 perp M_1M) and (N_1M_2 perp NN_1), and obviously (MM_1 parallel NN_1).

If the two functions have 4 distinct intersection points, they must have 2 intersection points when x > 0. For x > 0, we have f(x)=a(ln x- frac {1}{2}). Let's consider the function h(x)=a(ln x- frac {1}{2})-x^{2}. For the two functions to have 2 intersection points for x > 0, the function h(x) must have 2 zeros. We can express h(x) as: h(x)=aln x-x^{2}- frac {a}{2}, Let's find the derivative h'(x): h'(x)= frac {a}{x}-2x= frac {a-2x^{2}}{x}. When aleq 0, h'(x)leq 0, the function h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,+infty) and thus only has 1 zero point, which contradicts our condition. Therefore, we must have a > 0. Now, let's find the critical points by setting h'(x)=0: frac {a}{x}-2x= frac {a-2x^{2}}{x}=0, Solving this gives us x=pm frac {sqrt {2}a}{2}. Since x > 0, we only consider x= frac {sqrt {2}a}{2}. Analyzing the intervals, we find that on (0, frac {sqrt {2}a}{2}), h'(x) > 0, making h(x) an increasing function. On ( frac {sqrt {2}a}{2},+infty), h'(x) < 0, thus h(x) is a decreasing function. For h(x) to have 2 zeros, the graph must intersect the x-axis at 2 points. Therefore, we must have h(frac {sqrt {2}a}{2}) > 0. This yields the inequality: aln (frac {sqrt {2}a}{2})-(frac {sqrt {2}a}{2})^{2}- frac {a}{2} > 0. We transform this into the inequality ln {frac {a}{2}} > 2, from which we can deduce that a > 2e^{2}.

We also know the hypotenuse c = 13 inches, so by the Pythagorean theorem, [ a^2 + b^2 = 13^2 = 169. ] To identify values of a and b that satisfy both conditions, we consider integer solutions that fit Pythagorean triples. Notably, 5, 12, 13 is one such triple: [ 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169, quad 5 times 12 = 60. ] But we need 5 times 12 / 2 = 24, scaling this by frac{4}{5}, the dimensions become 4 and 9.6 which is not an integer solution. Moving to the triple directly: [ 2 times 24 / 2 = 24 text{, so } a = 2, b = 24. ] So, hypotenuse c obtained: [ 2^2 + 24^2 = 4 + 576 = 580, ] This does not fit the given hypotenuse of 13, indicating an error in the use of a standard triple. So, we must solve using equations for a and b: Since we need integer solutions: [ a = b - 5 text{ or } a = b - 7 ] leading to: [ (b-5)^2 + b^2 = 169 text{ or } (b-7)^2 + b^2 = 169. ] Deriving the equations, we determine b = 12 and a = 5, which fits. The area scale factor from smaller to larger triangle is: [ frac{600}{24} = 25. ] Hence, side lengths scale by sqrt{25} = 5. Thus, the larger triangle's corresponding sides are 5(5) = 25 and 5(12) = 60. The sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is 25 + 60 = boxed{85}."},{"prompt":"Given an ellipse with its focus on the xaxis, dfrac{x^{2}}{m}+dfrac{y^{2}}{4}=1, and the eccentricity is dfrac{sqrt {2}}{2}, then the real number m is equal to: A: 2 B: 8 C: 4+2sqrt {2} D: 42sqrt {2}","completion":"Given: An ellipse with its focus on the x-axis, described by the equation dfrac{x^{2}}{m}+dfrac{y^{2}}{4}=1, and an eccentricity of dfrac{sqrt {2}}{2}.

For an ellipse centered at the origin, with semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b, and distance between the foci 2c, the eccentricity e is given by e = dfrac{c}{a}. For the given ellipse, the semi-major axis is sqrt{m} if m geq 4, which we assume since the focus is on the x-axis (implying that the larger dimension is aligned with the x-axis), and the semi-minor axis is 2.

How does the statement change if two or all three of the sphere radii are equal?","completion":"\`\`\`markdown 1. **Setup and Basic Considerations:** Let's consider the problem in a planar context. Take the line segment (E_1E_2), and denote the centers of the spheres (g_1, g_2, g) as (O_1, O_2, O) respectively, intersecting with a plane (S). If the three centers lie on a straight line (e), then any plane (S) containing (e) will intersect the spheres in circles, denoted (k_1, k_2), and (k) respectively. Consequently, (E_1) and (E_2) are points on the lines (OO_1) and (OO_2), and thus lie on (S). 2. **Intersection and Tangency:** In plane (S), circles (k_1) and (k_2) are touched (either inscribed or circumscribed) by circle (k) just as sphere (g) touches (g_1) and (g_2). Whether the tangency is internal or external, the questions about the constancy of a point on line (E_1E_2) are precisely the same as those addressed in the exercise 558 (referred to in the problem statement). 3. **Fixed Points and Similarity Centers:** The fixed points (H_k) and (H_b) are independent of the position of (S) since they lie on line (O_1O_2), which is contained in all configurations of (S). The distance from the respective centers only depends on (d = O_1O_2) and the radii of the spheres forming the focal circles. Thus, (H_k) and (H_b) are the external and internal similarity centers, respectively, of the two spheres. Similar observations hold for lines (E_1E_3) and (E_2E_3). 4. **Considering Three Points:** Now evaluating the three points (E_1, E_2, E_3) (as stated) and ensuring they lie on a straight line, it comes down to identifying six points: the external and internal similarity centers of each pair formed by (g_1, g_2, g_3). 5. **External and Internal Tangency Cases:** These centers lie in the plane defined by (O_1O_2O_3 = S^*). Correspondingly, they are interpreted as points in the plane slices of spheres (g) and (g_1, g_2, g_3), being external or internal similarity centers. According to known properties (from (^{2})), these six points are arranged such that three external centers are collinear, and each of the other lines of collinear points contains two internal and one external center such that each line contains one center from each pair of circles. As such, for any configuration of (g) with the given spheres, three points form a collinear set. 6. **Conclusion with Special Cases:** If all centers (O_1, O_2, O_3) are on a single line (t), then the mentioned lines align with (t). - If (r_1 = r_2) and (g) touches (g_1) and (g_2) in the same manner, then (E_1E_2) is parallel to (O_1O_2). If the tangency sense is opposite, (E_1E_2) crosses the midpoint of (O_1O_2). - If (r_1 = r_2 = r_3), the same principles apply for all pairs of spheres. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The fixed points and their collinearity are preserved as defined by the problem constraints and previously cited exercises.}} ] \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Given the parabola C: y^{2}=2pxleft(p gt 0right), the line x2y+1=0 intersects C at points A and B, and |AB|=4sqrt{15}.

Substituting x from the line equation into the parabola equation gives us: [y^{2}=2p(x)=2p(2y+1)] Simplifying, we get: [y^{2}-4py+2p=0] 2. From the quadratic equation, we know: [y_{1}+y_{2}=4p, quad y_{1}y_{2}=2p] And the discriminant Delta must be positive for real roots: [Delta =16p^{2}-8p gt 0] Simplifying, we find: [p(2p-1) gt 0] Thus, p gt frac{1}{2}. 3.

Given overrightarrow{MF}cdotoverrightarrow{NF}=0, we have: [(x_{1}-1)(x_{2}-1)+y_{1}y_{2}=0] Substituting y_{1}+y_{2}=4m and y_{1}y_{2}=-4n: [4m^{2}=n^{2}-6n+1] Therefore, 4(m^{2}+n)=(n-1)^{2} gt 0, implying nneq 1 and n^{2}-6n+1geqslant 0. 3.

Given ngeqslant 3+2sqrt{2} or nleqslant 3-2sqrt{2}, the minimum area occurs when n=3-2sqrt{2}, leading to: [S_{min}=(2-2sqrt{2})^{2}=12-8sqrt{2}] Therefore, the minimum area of triangle MNF is boxed{12-8sqrt{2}}."},{"prompt":"At a busy transportation hub, there are 4 stations (Station A, Station B, Station C, and Station D).

Therefore, (O) is the midpoint of (AB). 2. **Positioning and Geometry:** - Let (P) and (Q) be the points where plane (p) intersects circle (C). - Plane (p) also intersects the entire sphere in another circle (C'), and let the radius of (C') be denoted by (r'). 3. **Establishing BP and BQ Relationship:** - Note that any point on the circle (C) is equidistant from the center of the sphere. - Since angles (angle AP) and (angle AQ) subtended by the same segment (AP = AQ), the angles (angle ABP ) and (angle ABQ) are also equal. 4. **Congruence of Triangles:** - Because angles (angle ABP) and (angle ABQ) are equal and they share side (AB), triangles ( triangle ABP ) and ( triangle ABQ ) are congruent (by ASA criteria). 5. **Coordinate Geometry Application:** - Since triangles ( triangle ABP ) and ( triangle ABQ ) are congruent, (BP = BQ) and hence ( BR = BQ ), where (R) is a point on (C') such that (BP) and (BR) are equal. 6. **Using the Power of a Point Theorem:** - Consider the power of a point theorem at (B), which states that the product of the segments of any chord passing through the point is equal. Thus: [ BP cdot BQ = (BR)^2 = AB^2 - AP^2 ] - Here, ( AB^2 ) is the square of the diameter of the sphere and ( AP^2 ) is the square of the radius of the circle (C). 7. **Conclusion:** - The product ( BP cdot BQ = AB^2 - AP^2 ) does not depend on the specific choice of the plane (p) intersecting (AB) but solely on the fixed distances ( AB ) and ( AP ). - Therefore, we conclude that ( BP cdot BQ ) is independent of the choice of plane (p).

How many total polled votes were there?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of valid polled votes as V. Since one candidate got 20% of the votes, this means the other candidate got 80% of the votes because there are only two candidates and their vote percentages must add up to 100%. The candidate who got 20% of the votes was defeated by 500 votes. This means that the difference between the 80% and 20% of the votes is 500 votes. So, we can set up the following equation: 80% of V - 20% of V = 500 votes (80/100)V - (20/100)V = 500 (0.8)V - (0.2)V = 500 (0.8 - 0.2)V = 500 (0.6)V = 500 V = 500 / 0.6 V = 833.33 Since the number of votes must be a whole number, we can round this to 833 valid votes.

We are looking for a point on the curve where the tangent line is parallel to the given line 2x - y - 4 = 0. The slope of this line is 2 (since rearranging it into slope-intercept form y = 2x - 4 reveals the slope). Therefore, we set the slope of the tangent equal to 2: [2e^{2x_0} = 2.] 3. Solving the equation 2e^{2x_0} = 2 for x_0, we find that e^{2x_0} = 1. This implies 2x_0 = 0 because the exponential function e^x = 1 when x = 0. Thus, we have x_0 = 0. 4. Substituting x_0 = 0 into the original curve equation y = e^{2x}, we find the y-coordinate of the point of tangency, which gives y = e^{2(0)} = 1. Therefore, the point of tangency P is (0, 1). 5. To find the shortest distance d from the point P(0, 1) to the line 2x - y - 4 = 0, we use the distance formula for a point to a line: [d = frac{|2(0) - 1 - 4|}{sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|-5|}{sqrt{5}} = sqrt{5}.] Therefore, the shortest distance from a point on the curve y = e^{2x} to the line 2x - y - 4 = 0 is boxed{sqrt{5}}, which corresponds to choice A."},{"prompt":"Given that cos(75^circ + alpha) = frac{1}{2}, where alpha is an angle in the third quadrant, find the value of cos(105^circ alpha) + sin(alpha 105^circ).","completion":"Since cos(75^circ + alpha) = frac{1}{2} and alpha is an angle in the third quadrant, 75^circ + alpha is an angle in the fourth quadrant because the sum of the angles exceeds 180^circ but is less than 270^circ. In the fourth quadrant, the cosine is positive and the sine is negative. The angle alpha itself, being in the third quadrant, will satisfy: [75^circ + alpha = -60^circ + 360^circ k,] where k is an integer, because the cosine of -60^circ is frac{1}{2} and the angles differ by a full circle. Solving for alpha gives: [alpha = -75^circ - 60^circ + 360^circ k = -135^circ + 360^circ k.] Since alpha is in the third quadrant, it should be between 180^circ and 270^circ. Hence, k=1 and alpha = 225^circ. Now we consider cos(105^circ - alpha) and sin(alpha - 105^circ). Since alpha = 225^circ, we have: [cos(105^circ - 225^circ) = cos(-120^circ) = cos(240^circ),] [sin(225^circ - 105^circ) = sin(120^circ).] Both 240^circ and 120^circ lie in the second quadrant, where cosine is negative and sine is positive.

Since there are three girls, the sum of candies received by all three girls is: [ 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 ] 4.

Consider a polygon ( P ) in the coordinate plane, with the following properties: - ( P ) is a 100-sided polygon. - All its vertices lie on lattice points. - All its sides are parallel to coordinate axes. - All its side lengths are odd numbers. 2. We need to prove that the area of ( P ) is an odd number. 3. Suppose the entire polygon ( P ) lies inside the first quadrant. If not, we can translate it appropriately so this is the case. 4. As we traverse the boundary of ( P ) in a clockwise direction, let's label the 50 horizontal sides ( 1, 2, ldots, 50 ). Define the area of the rectangle on the ( x )-axis with the ( i )-th horizontal side as its lower base and its upper base appropriately, as ( S_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 50 ). 5. The area ( S ) of the polygon ( P ) can be expressed as: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{50} (pm S_i) ] Here, the signs ( pm ) depend on whether the direction of traversal of the corresponding rectangle is the same or opposite to the positive ( x )-axis. 6. For example, the area ( S ) might be: [ S = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 - S_4 + S_5 + cdots + S_{47} - S_{48} + S_{49} - S_{50} ] 7. Since the rectangles formed by these sides have odd lengths (due to all sides of ( P ) being odd), the oddity of their areas is determined by their vertical heights. Pairs of consecutive rectangles have heights differing by an odd number, leading to alternating odd-even area properties among these rectangles. 8. There are 50 such rectangles, and since their height differences alternate in terms of oddity, there are exactly 25 rectangles with odd areas among these rectangles – considering the property of consecutive pairs differing by odd lengths. 9. Therefore, the sum ( S ) of these areas retains the odd property: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{50} (pm S_i) = text{sum of 25 odd numbers (rectangles with odd areas)}. ] Since the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd, ( S ) is an odd number. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The area of the polygon } P text{ is an odd number.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given tan (pialpha)= frac {3}{4}, alpha in (frac {pi}{2},pi), find cos alpha =( ).

Solution Enhancement: Step 1: Recall the trigonometric identity for tangent of angle difference: tan (pi-alpha)= frac {tan pi - tan alpha}{1 + tan pi tan alpha}. Since tan pi = 0, the expression simplifies to tan (pi-alpha)= -tan alpha. Step 2: Apply the given information: -tan alpha = frac {3}{4}. Rewrite this expression using the definition of tangent: frac {-sin alpha}{cos alpha} = frac {3}{4}. Step 3: Introduce a variable k to represent the common denominator: -sin alpha = 3k and cos alpha = 4k. Step 4: Use the Pythagorean identity sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1 to solve for k: (3k)^2 + (4k)^2 = 1, which yields 9k^2 + 16k^2 = 1. Solving for k gives k = pm frac{1}{5}.

Since a_n in mathbb{N}^*, it follows that a_{n+1}+a_n neq 0, thus a_{n+1}-a_n-4=0. This means a_{n+1}-a_n=4, therefore, the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence.

Let's start by defining the polynomial ( f(x) ). We know that it must satisfy the condition: [ f(x^2 + 1) - f(x^2 - 1) = 4x^2 + 6 ] 2.

Consider the difference between these two polynomials' general terms: [ d_k(x) = a_k left[ (x^2 + 1)^k - (x^2 - 1)^k right] ] 4. Using the binomial theorem, simplify the difference using the identity ( u^k - v^k = (u-v)(u^{k-1} + u^{k-2}v + cdots + v^{k-1}) ): [ d_k(x) = a_k left[ (x^2 + 1)^k - (x^2 - 1)^k right] = 2 a_k x^2 left[ (x^2 + 1)^{k-1} + (x^2 + 1)^{k-2}(x^2 - 1) + cdots + (x^2 - 1)^{k-1} right] ] 5. Since each term in the sum is a polynomial with degrees ranging from (2k - 2) down to some lower degree, the highest degree term will determine the polynomial's overall degree. Given: [ f(x^2 + 1) - f(x^2 - 1) = 4x^2 + 6 ] We observe that ( 4x^2 + 6 ) is a quadratic polynomial, meaning the highest degree term is ( x^2 ). Therefore, the highest degree term in the difference ( f(x^2 + 1) - f(x^2 - 1) ) must also have its highest degree term being ( 2n - 2 ). 6. Since the polynomial (4x^2 + 6) is quadratic (degree 2), we must have (2n - 2 = 2), which implies (n = 2). 7. Hence, ( f(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial: [ f(x) = a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 ] 8.
