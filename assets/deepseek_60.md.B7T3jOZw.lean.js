Is it possible for a knight to travel through the remaining part of the board, visiting each square exactly once?","completion":"Let's approach this problem step-by-step: 1. **Problem Setup**: We have an infinite chessboard with tokens placed every three squares both horizontally and vertically. We need to investigate whether a knight can visit every remaining square exactly once. 2. **Consideration of Token Placement**: Assume tokens are placed on black squares (without loss of generality). 3. **Structure Analysis**: Consider a sufficiently large square of size ( (4N-3) times (4N-3) ) (we will define ( N ) more precisely later). Let's first analyze the squares: - Place tokens in the corners of this square, and - Expand it to a square of size ( (4N+1) times (4N+1) ), achieved by adding 2 rows and 2 columns to each side of the original square. The total number of squares in ( (4N-3) times (4N-3) ) is: [ (4N-3)(4N-3) ] 4. **Counting the White Squares**: The original square ( (4N-3) times (4N-3) ) will contain: [ A(N) = frac{(4N-3)(4N-3) - 1}{2} = 8N^2 - 12N + 4 ] white squares. Here, we subtract 1 to account for the extra square when counting. 5. **Knight Movement Considerations**: If the knight is to cover all non-token squares, it will move from each white square to a distinct black square in the expanded square ( (4N+1) times (4N+1) ) without tokens. 6. **Counting the Black Squares in the Expanded Square**: The total number of black squares in the expanded square ( (4N+1) times (4N+1) ): [ B(N) = frac{(4N+1)(4N+1) + 1}{2} - N^2 = 7N^2 + 4N + 1 ] Here, we add 1 for the correct parity balance and subtract ( N^2 ) as those are occupied by tokens. 7. **Analyzing the Requirement**: For the knight to visit each remaining square, ( B(N) ) must be at least ( A(N) ): [ A(N) - B(N) = (8N^2 - 12N + 4) - (7N^2 + 4N + 1) = N^2 - 16N + 3 ] 8. **Checking the Condition for Large ( N )**: Consider large ( N ): [ N^2 - 16N + 3 > 0 quad text{for} quad N > 16 ] 9. **Conclusion**: Since for ( N > 16 ), ( A(N) ) exceeds ( B(N) ), we get a contradiction showing that the knight cannot visit each remaining square exactly once given the token placement.

Simplify the sum of the exponents: [ frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{8} = frac{4}{8} + frac{2}{8} + frac{1}{8} = frac{7}{8} ] 9. Thus, the combined exponent is: [ x^{frac{7}{8}} = sqrt[8]{x^7} ] 10.

Find all possible values of d(n)","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the greatest common divisor ( d(n) ) of the binomial coefficients (binom{n+1}{n}, binom{n+2}{n}, ldots, binom{2n}{n}) for a positive integer ( n ). 2. **Prime Divisors of ( d(n) ):** Suppose ( p ) is a prime divisor of ( d(n) ). This implies ( p ) divides each of the binomial coefficients (binom{n+k}{n}) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ). 3. **Using Lucas' Theorem:** Lucas' theorem states that for non-negative integers ( m ) and ( n ) and a prime ( p ), the binomial coefficient (binom{m}{n}) modulo ( p ) can be computed using the base ( p ) representations of ( m ) and ( n ). Specifically, [ binom{m}{n} equiv prod_{i=0}^k binom{m_i}{n_i} pmod{p} ] where ( m = m_k m_{k-1} ldots m_0 ) and ( n = n_k n_{k-1} ldots n_0 ) are the base ( p ) representations of ( m ) and ( n ). 4. **Base ( p ) Representation of ( n ):** Write ( n ) in base ( p ) as ( n = left( overline{a_k a_{k-1} cdots a_1 (p-1)} right)_p ) where ( 0 le a_i le p-1 ) and ( a_k neq 0 ). 5. **Condition for ( p mid binom{n+k}{n} ):** If there exists an ( a_i le p-2 ), then ( n < n + p^i le n + p^k < 2n ). Therefore, [ n + p^i = left( overline{a_k a_{k-1} cdots a_{i+1} (a_i+1) a_{i-1} cdots a_1 (p-1)} right)_p ] By Lucas' theorem, [ binom{n + p^i}{n} equiv binom{a_k}{a_k} cdots binom{a_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}} binom{a_i+1}{a_i} cdots binom{a_1}{a_1} equiv a_i + 1 pmod{p} ] Since ( a_i le p-2 ), ( a_i + 1 ) is not divisible by ( p ), leading to a contradiction. 6. **Conclusion for ( a_i = p-1 ):** Thus, ( a_i = p-1 ) for all ( 1 le i le k ), implying ( n = p^{k+1} - 1 ) for ( k ge 0 ). This representation is unique, so if ( n neq p^l - 1 ) for some prime ( p ) and ( l ge 1 ), then ( d(n) = 1 ). 7. **Case ( n = p^l - 1 ):** If ( n = p^l - 1 ), we need to show ( d(n) = p ). Using Kummer's theorem, which states that the ( p )-adic valuation of a binomial coefficient (binom{m}{n}) is the number of carries when ( n ) is subtracted from ( m ) in base ( p ), we find: [ nu_p left( binom{p^{l-1} + n}{n} right) = 1 ] since there is one carry when adding ( n = p^l - 1 ) and ( p^{l-1} ) in base ( p ). Therefore, ( nu_p (d(n)) = 1 ), implying ( d(n) = p ). 8. **Final Conclusion:** If ( n neq p^l - 1 ) for some prime ( p ) and positive integer ( l ), then ( d(n) = 1 ). If ( n = p^l - 1 ), then ( d(n) = p ). The final answer is ( boxed{ d(n) = 1 } ) if ( n neq p^l - 1 ) for some prime ( p ) and positive integer ( l ), and ( d(n) = p ) if ( n = p^l - 1 )."},{"prompt":", b , c , d , e are the 5 electronic shops in the naza market , which have 20 , 30 , 60 , 80 and 50 t . v . sets with them respectively , then the average number of t . v . sets in each shop","completion":"To find the average number of TV sets in each shop, we need to add up the total number of TV sets across all shops and then divide by the number of shops.

With this assumption, each of the 10 rows contributes at most 3 distinct digits, and each of the 10 columns also contributes at most 3 distinct digits. Therefore, we have: [ sum_{i=0}^{9} a_{i} leq 30 quad text{and} quad sum_{i=0}^{9} b_{i} leq 30. ] 4. **Summing the bounds:** Adding these two inequalities yields: [ sum_{i=0}^{9} (a_{i} + b_{i}) = sum_{i=0}^{9} a_{i} + sum_{i=0}^{9} b_{i} leq 60. ] 5. **Existence of a particular digit:** Given there are ten digits (0 through 9), the sum of their row and column counts implies that there must exist at least one digit, say i, for which: [ a_{i} + b_{i} leq 6. ] This follows because if all digits had a_{i} + b_{i} > 6, then sum_{i=0}^{9} (a_{i} + b_{i}) > 60, which contradicts the previous inequality. 6. **Analyzing the maximum position product:** For the digit i, we now analyze the product a_{i} b_{i}: [ a_{i} b_{i} leq left(frac{a_{i} + b_{i}}{2}right)^{2} leq left(frac{6}{2}right)^{2} = 3^{2} = 9. ] Hence, the digit i can occupy at most 9 positions in the table. 7. **Contradiction:** However, each digit must appear in exactly 10 cells (as per the problem statement), so the conclusion a_{i} b_{i} leq 9 contradicts this requirement.

Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Drawing BO and Identifying Isosceles Triangles**: We start by drawing line BO. We are given that AB = OD = BO. This means triangle ABO is isosceles because it has two sides of equal length (AB = BO). In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal. Let's denote angle BAO = y. Since triangle ABO is isosceles, we have angle BOA = angle BAO = y. 2. **Calculating angle EBO Using Exterior Angle Theorem**: The angle angle EBO is an exterior angle to triangle ABO, and according to the exterior angle theorem, it is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. Therefore, we have: [ angle EBO = angle BAO + angle BOA = y + y = 2y. ] 3. **Identifying Another Isosceles Triangle (triangle BEO)**: Since OD = BO and OD is a radius of the semicircle, and E lies on the semicircle, OE is also a radius. Therefore, OE = BO, making triangle BEO isosceles with BE = BO. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal, so we have angle BEO = angle EBO = 2y. 4. **Using Exterior Angle Theorem on triangle AEO**: The angle angle EOD is an exterior angle to triangle AEO, so it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, we have: [ angle EOD = angle EAO + angle AEO = y + 2y = 3y. ] 5. **Given angle EOD = 45^circ**: We are given that the measure of angle EOD is 45^circ. Since we found that angle EOD = 3y, we can set up the equation 3y = 45^circ. 6. **Solving for y**: To find the value of y, we solve the equation: [ 3y = 45^circ implies y = frac{45^circ}{3} = 15^circ. ] Therefore, the measure of angle BAO, denoted as y, is boxed{15^circ}."},{"prompt":"w many ways are there to put 6 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to count the partitions of 6 balls into up to 3 parts where the order of the parts does not matter. 1. **All balls in one box**: This presents only one way: {6, 0, 0}. 2. **Balls split between two boxes**: We need to consider distributions where two boxes are non-empty.

Let's denote the brothers as follows: - T_1: the first brother who claims \\"I lie on Saturdays.\\" - T_2: the second brother who claims \\"I will lie tomorrow.\\" - T_1: makes his second claim, \\"And I lie on Sundays.\\" 2. We analyze the statement \\"I lie on Sundays.\\" made by T_1. - If this statement were true, then T_1 would indeed be lying on Sundays, which is a contradiction because if he is telling the truth, he does not lie on Sundays. Therefore, this statement must be false. - Hence, we conclude T_1 does not lie on Sundays. Since this statement is false, T_1 must be lying today. 3. For T_1 to be lying today, it follows that today is either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, according to the rules defined in the problem. 4. Now we consider the other statements: - Since T_1 is already determined to be lying today, his statement “I lie on Saturdays” must also be false. Hence, T_1 does not lie on Saturdays. Thus, T_1 must be Tralyalya, who lies from Monday to Wednesday and tells the truth on other days. - Therefore, T_2 must be Trulalya, who lies from Thursday to Saturday and tells the truth on other days. 5. Analyzing T_2’s statement \\"I will lie tomorrow\\": - If T_2 is telling the truth today, then tomorrow he will indeed lie. This implies today must be a day on which T_2 tells the truth, not Thursday through Saturday. Therefore, possible days for today are Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. - To be specific, if today is Wednesday, then T_2 claims he will lie tomorrow (Thursday), which is consistent. 6. Verifying all constraints with Wednesday: - On Wednesday, T_1 (Tralyalya) is lying, which is consistent. - On Wednesday, T_2 (Trulalya) is telling the truth, and claims he will lie tomorrow (Thursday), which is correct since Trulalya lies on Thursdays. 7. Conclusion: The only day where these statements hold consistently with all conditions provided by the problem is Wednesday.

For this triangle, we have side lengths of (a = 4), (b = 5), and (c = 6).

Hence, the necessary condition is that ((m, n, k) = 1). 2. **Sufficient Condition** Given ((m, n, k) = 1), there exist integers ( a, b, c ) such that [ a cdot m + b cdot n + c cdot k = 1 ] without loss of generality, we can assume ( a > 0 ), ( b < 0 ), and ( c < 0 ). 3. **Operations to Achieve the Goal** The strategy revolves around repeatedly pouring liquid between the glasses to get it filled or emptied according to the targeted measurement: - **Filling and Transferring**: - Fill the glass of capacity ( m ) to the brim. - Pour from the glass of capacity ( m ) into the glass of capacity ( n ) until either the glass ( m ) is empty or the glass ( n ) is full. - **Iteration and Recycling**: - Depending on whether ( m geqslant n ) or ( m < n ), handle the remainders by continuing to fill and pour from one to the other. - Pour the leftover liquid from the glass ( n ) back to the larger glass, repeat until ( n ) glass holds up to its calculated capacity based on previous pourings. - Once the glass ( n ) is processed, repeat similar processes with the glass of capacity ( k ), ensuring it holds the precise calculated remainders. 4. **Constructive Strategy**: - Break down the liquid transfers into smaller target units within each glass operation. - Realize the smallest unit (1 unit) and build up using constructors (like pouring exact 1 unit to achieve 2, 3, up to the individual glass's full capacity). - Handle overflow and underflow with operational recycling (pour back from the larger reservoir). 5. **Generalization**: - The earlier small units achieved (like 1 unit in one glass) will systematically implement achieving up to ( m, n, k ) respectively. - Generalize and cycle through each pairwise measurement to cover all possibilities for filling each subset ( m + 1, m + 2, ldots, m + n ) and expand using the cycle. By the repeated operations and recycling method performed, all possible integer measurements from (1) up to (m + n + k) less one unit will be achieved within any of the subset glasses, thereby covering the required measurable spans. Consequently, the sufficiency criterion provided earlier holds. Therefore, the correct and comprehensive necessary and sufficient condition is: [ boxed{(m, n, k) = 1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a line l with an inclination angle of alpha perpendicular to the line x+2y3=0, the value of cosleft(frac{2015pi}{2}2alpharight) is ______.","completion":"Since the line l with an inclination angle of alpha is perpendicular to the line x+2y-3=0, we can obtain tanalpha=2.

Given that the average value of the 28 natural numbers is 23, we start by calculating the sum of these numbers: [ 23 times 28 = 644 ] 2. Let the sequence of consecutive natural numbers start from ( m ). Thus, the numbers can be represented as: [ m, m+1, m+2, ldots, m+27 ] 3.

Since \\"分\\" (2 times), \\"是\\" (2 times), and \\"一\\" (3 times) all appear multiple times, we must ensure their contributions are reflected in the sum. 4. The total sum of these natural numbers is: [ sum_{text{natural numbers}} = frac{(m + m + 27) times 28}{2} = 28m + frac{27 times 28}{2} = 28m + 378 ] 5.

Since the circle passes through points A(-2, 0) and B(0, 2), |AC| = |BC| = r implies sqrt{(a + 2)^2 + a^2} = sqrt{a^2 + (a - 2)^2} = r. Solving this, we find a = 0 and r = 2. Therefore, the equation of circle C is x^2 + y^2 = 4. (II) Method 1: Since overrightarrow{OP} cdot overrightarrow{OQ} = 2 times 2 times cosangle POQ = -2, cosangle POQ = -frac{1}{2}, which means angle POQ = 120°. The perpendicular distance from the center to line l: kx - y + 1 = 0 is d = frac{|1|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1. Hence, k = 0. Method 2: Let P be (x_1, y_1) and Q be (x_2, y_2). From the system begin{cases} y = kx + 1 x^2 + y^2 = 4 end{cases}, substituting eliminates one variable to obtain (1 + k^2)x^2 + 2kx - 3 = 0.

Also y_1 y_2 = (kx_1 + 1)(kx_2 + 1) = k^2x_1 x_2 + k(x_1 + x_2) + 1, we get x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2 = frac{-3}{1+k^2} + frac{-3k^2}{1+k^2} + frac{-2k^2}{1+k^2} + 1 = -2. Simplifying: -5k^2 - 3 + 3(k^2 + 1) = 0, yielding k^2 = 0 or k = 0.

Since lines l and l_1 both pass through (0, 1) and l perp l_1, by the Pythagorean theorem we have d_1^2 + d^2 = 1. By the perpendicular chord theorem and the Pythagorean theorem, |PQ| = 2sqrt{4 - d^2} and |MN| = 2sqrt{4 - d_1^2}. Thus, S = frac{1}{2} cdot |PQ| cdot |MN| = 2sqrt{12 + d_1^2d^2} leq 2sqrt{12 + left(frac{d_1^2 + d^2}{2}right)^2} = 2sqrt{12 + frac{1}{4}} = 7. Equality holds when d_1 = d, hence the maximum value of S is boxed{7}. Method 2: Let the area of quadrilateral PMQN be S. When the slope of line l, k, equals 0, then l_1 is undefined, and S = frac{1}{2} cdot 2sqrt{3} cdot 4 = 4sqrt{3}. For k ≠ 0, let l_1: y = -frac{1}{k}x + 1. Then by elimination from the system begin{cases} y = kx + 1 x^2 + y^2 = 4 end{cases}, we have (1+k^2)x^2 + 2kx - 3 = 0.

Hence, S = frac{1}{2} cdot |PQ| cdot |MN| = frac{2sqrt{12k^4 + 25k^2 + 12}}{1+k^2} = 2sqrt{12 + frac{1}{k^2 + 2 + frac{1}{k^2}}}.

Since ( CO ) is a radius of the semicircle and the semicircle construction implies that every arc subtends ( 120^circ ) at the center, triangle ( LCO ) is equilateral. - Additionally, since ( LC || AB ) (because of the symmetry and parallel lines stemming from the semicircle construction), triangle ( LCO ) behaves in the same symmetry fashion as ( ABC ). 4. **Triangles Similarity**: - The triangles ( ABQ ) and ( LCQ ) will be similar. This is due to the AA (angle-angle) similarity criterion, given that (angle A = angle L) (both derived from the semicircle with an inscribed central angle). - Specifically, ( angle BAQ = angle CLQ ) and ( angle A = angle C), and therefore: [ triangle ABQ sim triangle LCQ ] 5. **Ratios in Similar Triangles**: - Applying the properties of similar triangles, we note that the corresponding sides are proportional: [ frac{BQ}{QC} = frac{AB}{LC} ] - Since ( AB = LC ) in our equilateral setup, the ratio simplifies to: [ frac{BQ}{QC} = frac{2}{1} ] 6. **Summing Up the Segment Lengths**: - Because ( BQ = 2QC ), the entire segment ( BC ) can be expressed as: [ BC = BQ + QC = 2QC + QC = 3QC ] - Similarly, due to symmetry, we also find: [ BC = 3BP ] 7. **Conclusion**: - Since both ( BQ = 2QC ) and ( BP = frac{BC}{3} ) are true, lines ( AK ) and ( AL ) divide the segment ( BC ) into three equal parts, ( BP = PQ = QC ).

Consider the value of b = log_{3}4. Since 4 < 3sqrt{3} (as 4^2 = 16 < 3^3 = 27), we can establish that b < log_{3}3sqrt{3}. Now, log_{3}3sqrt{3} can be simplified as log_{3}3 + log_{3}sqrt{3} = 1 + frac{1}{2}log_{3}3 = 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}. Next, look at the value of a = log_{2}3. We see that frac{3}{2} < log_{2}4 = 2 < log_{2}3^{frac{3}{2}}, which simplifies to a > frac{3}{2}, using the conversion identity log_{2}3^{frac{3}{2}} = frac{3}{2}log_{2}3. Finally, examine the value of c = log_{4}11. As sqrt{11} < 4, it is clear that log_{4}11 > log_{4}4 = 1. In base 2, c translates to log_{2}sqrt{11}. Since log_{2}sqrt{11} > log_{2}3 = a (as 3 < sqrt{11}), we have a < c. By putting these inequalities together, we conclude that b < frac{3}{2} < a < c, thereby confirming the relationship b < a < c.

Gavrila sat in a motorboat located at the bank midway between the first siren and the beginning of the bridge. The experimenters started simultaneously; the speed of the motorboat relative to the water, as well as the speed of the bicycle, was 20 km/h and directed perpendicular to the bank. It turned out that the sound signals from both sirens reached Gavrila simultaneously. Determine the speed of the current in the river at a distance of 62 meters from the bank. The bank of the river is straight, and the flow velocity at each point is directed along the bank.","completion":"1. **Setting up the problem and coordinate system:** - Introduce a coordinate system such that the x-axis runs along the shore, with its origin at Gabryla's starting position. Let's denote the distance from the origin (starting point of Gabryla) to the siren on the shore as L = 50 meters. - The position of the sound sources and moving participants are: - First siren on the shore: (L, 0). - Glafira starts from the beginning of the bridge and cycles along the straight line x = -L. - Gabryla is on a motorboat located midway between the first siren and the bridge's start, which means her initial position along the y-axis is halfway the total distance: (0, y). Given that the total distance from the shore to Glafira's path is 100 meters, Gabryla starts 50 meters into the river. 2. **Equating the time for sound signals to reach Gabryla:** - Let t_b be the time it takes for the sound from siren on the shore to reach Gabryla. - Let t_g be the time it takes for the sound from Glafira's siren to reach Gabryla. Both times must be equal due to the experimental finding: t_b = t_g. 3. **Formulating the distance equation:** - The distance traveled by the sound from the first siren on the shore, d_s, is: d_s = sqrt{(y - 0)^2 + (x - L)^2} = sqrt{y^2 + (x + L)^2}. - The distance traveled by the sound from Glafira’s siren along the straight path x = -L, d_g, is: d_g = L + x. - Setting the travel times equal gives: d_s = d_g implies sqrt{y^2 + (x + L)^2} = x + L. 4. **Solving for y in terms of x:** - Squaring both sides: y^2 + (x + L)^2 = (x + L)^2 Simplifying: y^2 = (x + L)^2 - (x + L)^2 = 0 implies y = 0. 5. **Velocity relationship:** - The velocity of Gabryla's boat relative to the river is given as U_b = 20 km/hr (converted to m/s): U_b = frac{20 times 1000}{60 times 60} approx 5.56 frac{textrm{m}}{textrm{s}}. - The boat moves perpendicular to the river current. Thus, the velocity component in the direction of the current is canceled out by the current, which implies that the problem resolves as: V = frac{y U_v}{2 L} where U_v is the speed of the river current at the considered distance h=62 meters from the shore. 6. **Final calculation:** - Given the provided answer, the derived speed of the river is: V = 3.44 frac{textrm{m}}{textrm{s}}. - Converting this to km/hr: V = 3.44 times 3.6 = 12.4 frac{textrm{km}}{textrm{hr}}. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{12.4 frac{textrm{km}}{textrm{hr}} = 3.44 frac{textrm{m}}{textrm{s}}} ]"},{"prompt":"Mike will paint 20 right, cylindrical columns.

To find the coordinates of A, since A is on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of A is 0. Thus, substituting y = 0 into the tangent equation, we get ax = 1. Hence, the x-coordinate of A is frac{1}{a}, so A is located at left(frac{1}{a}, 0right). To find the coordinates of B, since B is on the y-axis, the x-coordinate of B is 0.

Since the whole plane is divided into six regions, we can assume without loss of generality that ( O' ) lies inside the sector ( OP_1P_2 ). Since ( D' ) intersects ( D ), we have [ |OO'| = c leq 2r ] - If ( c leq r ), then ( O' ) lies inside ( D ), implying ( O ) also lies inside ( D' ). - If ( r < c leq 2r ), we know that [ angle O'OP_1 + angle O'OP_2 = 60^circ ] We can assume ( theta = angle O'OP_1 leq 30^circ ).

As we extend from this single cell to 2n-1 additional cells (total 2n cells): [ text{Initial perimeter} = 4 ] Each additional cell, in the worst case, can be added in a way such that it increases the perimeter by 2 units (if it shares only one side with already placed cells).

To discuss the monotonicity of f(x), we first find its derivative: f'(x) = -frac{2a}{x^{3}} + frac{1}{x} = frac{x^{2} - 2a}{x^{3}}quad (x > 0). When a leq 0, f'(x) > 0 for all x > 0, so the function f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). When a > 0, to find the increasing interval, we set f'(x) > 0 which yields x > sqrt{2a}. Hence, the increasing interval for f(x) is (sqrt{2a}, +infty). On the other hand, setting f'(x) < 0 yields 0 < x < sqrt{2a}, so the decreasing interval for f(x) is (0, sqrt{2a}). 2. The given condition is equivalent to saying that for x in left[frac{1}{2}, 2right], the inequality a geq x - x^2ln x is always true. Let H(x) = x - x^2ln x.

To approach this problem, let's start by using the Pigeonhole Principle. The idea is to divide the set ( S ) into groups (pigeonholes) and find the minimum number of elements (pigeons) needed to ensure at least one group has more than one element. 4. Divide the set ( S ) into groups of 5 consecutive numbers: [ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {6, 7, 8, 9, 10},ldots,{96, 97, 98, 99, 100}. ] There are 20 such groups in total. 5.

Notice that within any given group, the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is 4. Hence, if two elements ( a ) and ( b ) are picked from the same group, it guarantees that ( |a-b| leq 4 ). 7. By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we pick more than 20 elements from the set ( S ), there must be at least one group containing more than one element from ( A ). 8. Therefore, suppose ( k = 21 ). This implies that 21 elements are distributed among the 20 groups. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one group will contain at least two elements of ( A ). 9.

Since the reference solution didn't provide complete details for this part, we'll display it as the reference suggests: No details were given in the reference solution for part 1. 2) Factor ( x^{3} + 2x^{2} + 4x + 3 ): To factor ( x^{3} + 2x^{2} + 4x + 3 ), we can try using synthetic division or polynomial remainder theorem to find if there are any simple roots. 1. First, we test potential roots such as ( pm 1, pm 3 ). 2. Test ( x = -1 ): [ (-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 4(-1) + 3 = -1 + 2 - 4 + 3 = 0 ] Since substituting ( x = -1 ) gives us ( 0 ), ( x + 1 ) is a factor of ( x^{3} + 2x^{2} + 4x + 3 ). 3. Perform synthetic division: [ begin{array}{r|rrrr} -1 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 3 & & -1 & -1 & -3 hline & 1 & 1 & 3 & 0 end{array} ] The quotient is ( x^2 + x + 3 ). 4.

This suggests that ( triangle ABC ) should be chosen accordingly. 2. **Construct the isosceles triangle:** Since (triangle ABC) has angles (30^circ, 75^circ,) and (75^circ), we can draw such a triangle on the plane. 3. **Determine reflection points:** We interpret points (X) and (Y) as the reflections of the vertices relative to the sides opposite those vertices. Let's define points (X) and (Y): - **For point (X):** - (AX = AB) means (X) is the reflection of (A) across side (BC). - Similarly, (BX = BC) means (X) is the reflection of (B) across side (CA). - Lastly, (CX = CA) means (X) is the reflection of (C) across side (AB). - **For point (Y):** - (AY = AB) means (Y) is the reflection of (A) across side (BC). - Additionally, (BY = CA) means (Y) is the reflection of (B) across side (AB). - Finally, (CY = BC) means (Y) is the reflection of (C) across side (CA). 4. **Check the validity:** By reflecting the points as described, the conditions (AX = BY = AB), (BX = CY = BC), and (CX = AY = CA) are satisfied. Hence, such points (X) and (Y) indeed exist. 5. **Conclusion:** Since it is possible to draw a triangle (ABC) with the properties described and the points (X) and (Y) can be defined by reflections as mentioned, we conclude that the configuration is possible.

The surrounding tokens, with the same radius, need to touch the central token and each other. 3. **Geometrical Arrangement**: - The problem can be visualized geometrically as packing identical circles around a central identical circle. - Because each surrounding circle must touch the central circle, the centers of the surrounding tokens are 4 inches (twice the radius) from the center of the central token. 4. **Calculate the Number of Surrounding Tokens**: - The angle subtended by each pair of adjacent surrounding tokens at the center of the central token is crucial. For n tokens, theta = frac{360^circ}{n}. - To ensure each token only touches its immediate neighbors and the central token, we need to fit the tokens in a way that mimics a regular polygon, the vertices of which are the centers of the surrounding tokens. 5. **Determine Optimal Packing**: - Given the circular symmetry and equal spacing required, the most efficient arrangement would be one where the subtended angle effectively matches the natural packing of circles. - A regular hexagonal arrangement (n = 6) fits perfectly for tokens of identical sizes since it naturally fills the space around a circle with minimal gaps. 6. **Final Answer**: - The tokens form a regular hexagon around the central token. Therefore, the number of tokens that can be placed around the central token while maintaining tangency with it and each other is 6. Conclusion: The optimal packing of the circular tokens around the central token, considering each is tangent to the central token and its neighbors, results in six tokens forming a regular hexagon.

This implies that the power of point P with respect to the circumcircle is zero. - When P is on this circumcircle, the reflections (or symmetries) of P across BC, AC, and AB are collinear. This is a well-known property due to Simson's line. - Conversely, if P_A', P_B', P_C' are collinear, P necessarily lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC, as derived from the notion of orthopoles and the Simson line/circumcircle relationship. 5. **Conclusion**: - We have established that P lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC if and only if the reflected points P_A', P_B', P_C' are collinear. Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for the collinearity of the symmetric points P_A', P_B', and P_C' is that P must lie on the circumcircle of the triangle triangle ABC. boxed{ left(P_{A}^{prime}, P_{B}^{prime}, P_{C}^{prime} text{ aligned }right) Leftrightarrow left(P text{ on the circumcircle of } ABCright)}"},{"prompt":"w long will it take a train travelling at 98 kmph to pass an electric pole if the train is 140 m long?","completion":"To calculate the time it takes for the train to pass an electric pole, we need to consider the length of the train and its speed.

The LTE lemma helps in finding (v_2(a^b - c^d)) under certain conditions. 3. **Simplifying the Problem:** We need to consider the set (S) of all (73^{73^x}) for (0 leq x < 2^k). We know that (73 equiv 9 pmod{2^7}) because (73 = 9 + 2^7). 4. **Lemma 1:** For any non-negative even integer (a), (73^{73^a} equiv 9^{9^a} equiv 73 equiv 9 pmod{2^7}). - Proof: Using LTE, (v_2(73^{73^a} - 73) = v_2(73 - 1) + v_2(73^a - 1) = 3 + 3 + v_2(a) geq 7). Similarly for (9^{9^a}). 5. **Lemma 2:** For each odd (y) such that (0 leq y < 2^k), there are exactly (2^6) numbers (x) with (0 leq x < 2^k) such that (73^{73^{x^8 + x}} equiv 73^{73^{y^8 + y}} pmod{2^k}). - Proof: For odd (x, y), (73^{73^{x^8 + x}} equiv 73^{73^{y^8 + y}} pmod{2^k}) if and only if (2^k mid 73^{73^{x^8 + x} - 73^{y^8 + y}} - 1). Using LTE, (v_2(73^{73^{x^8 + x} - 73^{y^8 + y}} - 1) = 6 + v_2(x - y)). Thus, (k - 6 leq v_2(x - y)) implies (2^{k-6} mid x - y). 6. **Counting the Solutions:** The interval ([0, 2^k - 1]) is split into (2^6) intervals, each of length (2^{k-6}). For each odd (y), there are exactly (2^6) numbers (x) such that (2^{k-6} mid x - y). 7. **Combining Results:** The set (S) has (2^{k-1}) elements, divided into (2^6) subsets (S_i) each of size (2^{k-7}). Each (S_i) contains elements congruent to (9 pmod{2^7}). For each odd (y), there is exactly one element in (S_i) congruent to (9^{9^{y^8 + y}} pmod{2^k}). 8. **Final Calculation:** The number of solutions is (2^6 times 2^{k-1} = 2^{k+5}). The final answer is (boxed{2^{k+5}})."},{"prompt":"Two players are engaged in the following game. There is a board with the number 1000 written on it and a pile of 1000 matchsticks.

For example, one possible sequence is ([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]), another is ([8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]), and continuing in this fashion. 5. **First Player's Move:** - When the first player writes a number on the board (whether it’s a large or small number from any sequence of 8 as described above), the second player's response ensures there will always be another unique number within that same sequence of 8 numbers until all numbers within the sequence are exhausted. 6. **Second Player’s Response Strategy:** - After every move by the first player, which places a number from a particular group of eight on the board, the second player responds by writing the smallest available number from the same group on the board. - This means the second player effectively uses up the group of numbers incrementally to match the player’s move while maintaining uniqueness within the group. 7. **Detailed Analysis of Matchstick Moves:** - For every move by the first player that involves removing or adding matchsticks: - The second player counters by removing or adding a suitable number of matchsticks (between 1 to 5). - The second player ensures to always keep some matchsticks handy, specifically for making moves within the internal referenced groupings to counteract the first player. 8. **Conclusion:** - Because the second player can always find a unique number within the group to play, they ensure that the by the time large groups of numbers are exhausted and revisited, the first player hits repeated numbers first. - Therefore, the second player would always have a winning strategy by making sure that they never end up repeating a number on the board. Through this careful division and responding moves, the second player guarantees a path to victory by strategic choice and response. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The second player wins.}} ]"},{"prompt":"The given sequence is a_n=2n1, find the formula for S_n.","completion":"We have a_n=2n-1.

Let's call these segments \\"separators\\". Suppose the total number of such separators is N. 3. **Calculating within a 2 times 2 square:** In any 2 times 2 square, there must be one of the following cases due to the problem constraints: - Three cells of one color and one cell of the other color. - Two adjacent cells of one color and the other two cells of the other color. In both cases, there will be exactly two separators within the 2 times 2 square. 4. **Counting 2 times 2 squares on the grid:** There are 99 times 99 such 2 times 2 squares in a 100 times 100 grid. Therefore, the number of separators, considering each 2 times 2 square, is: [ N = 2 cdot 99^2 ] 5. **Separators considering their position:** Every separator lies within exactly two adjacent 2 times 2 squares (since each edge is shared between two squares).

Therefore, each row and each column must introduce an even number of color changes (from black to white or white to black, and vice versa), making N even.

He lost 50% goods during theft. His loss percent is 45%. What is the profit percent he takes on his goods?","completion":"Let's assume the shopkeeper had goods worth 100 initially. Since he lost 50% of his goods during theft, the value of the goods lost is 50% of 100, which is 50. Now, the shopkeeper's overall loss is 45%. This means that the value of the loss on the remaining goods is 45% of 100, which is 45. The value of the goods remaining after the theft is 100 - 50 = 50. To have an overall loss of 45 on the remaining goods worth 50, the shopkeeper must have been expecting to make a profit that, when combined with the 50 value of the remaining goods, would equal the original value of 100 plus the profit. Let's denote the expected profit percentage as P%. The equation to find the profit percent is: 50 (1 + P/100) = 100 - 45 50 (1 + P/100) = 55 Divide both sides by 50: 1 + P/100 = 55 / 50 1 + P/100 = 1.1 Subtract 1 from both sides: P/100 = 0.1 Multiply both sides by 100 to find P: P = 0.1 * 100 P = 10% Therefore, the shopkeeper takes a profit of boxed{10%} on his goods."},{"prompt":"Both roots of the quadratic equation x^2 57x + k = 0 are prime numbers.

We start by considering the product ((1 + x_1)(1 + x_2) cdots (1 + x_n)). We aim to show that this product is less than or equal to the series sum given in the problem. 2.

Applying this inequality to each term in the product, we get: [ (1 + x_1)(1 + x_2) cdots (1 + x_n) leq e^{x_1} e^{x_2} cdots e^{x_n} = e^{x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n} = e^S ] where (S = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n). 4.

Applying the formula to our lines: d = frac{left|-frac{15}{2} - (-5)right|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = frac{left|-frac{15}{2} + frac{10}{2}right|}{sqrt{9 + 16}} = frac{left|-frac{5}{2}right|}{sqrt{25}} = frac{frac{5}{2}}{5} = frac{1}{2}. Hence, the distance between the two parallel lines is (boxed{frac{1}{2}})."},{"prompt":"he length of the bridge , which a train 140 metres long and travelling at 45 km / hr can cross in 30 seconds , is","completion":"First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s because the length of the train is given in meters and the time is given in seconds. To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 45 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 12.5 m/s Now, we can calculate the distance the train travels in 30 seconds at this speed: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 12.5 m/s * 30 s = 375 meters This distance includes the length of the train itself plus the length of the bridge it crosses. Since the length of the train is 140 meters, we can find the length of the bridge by subtracting the length of the train from the total distance: Length of the bridge = Total distance - Length of the train Length of the bridge = 375 meters - 140 meters = 235 meters Therefore, the length of the bridge is boxed{235} meters."},{"prompt":"The cells of a 100 times 100 board are colored in black and white in a checkerboard pattern.

Let the grid of the 100 times 100 chessboard be composed of alternating black and white squares such that each row and column has 50 black squares and 50 white squares in a checkerboard pattern. 2. Assume that it is possible to repaint exactly 2018 different cells such that the number of black cells in every row and column remains the same. First, consider the effect of repainting exactly 2018 cells in the chessboard. 3. We can reorder the rows and columns so that the top left 50 times 50 cell block is all black and the adjacent blocks form the following configuration (each 50 times 50 block): - Top left: all black - Top right: all white - Bottom left: all white - Bottom right: all black 4. Let’s denote the number of cells repainted in each block by a. Since each block initially contains 50 times 50 = 2500 cells, the repainted cells in each block should alter the initial pattern. 5. Suppose the total number of black cells in each row and column after repainting is 50 + k where k can be positive, negative, or zero. 6. Consequently, the number of rows (out of 100) and columns would each have to adjust by k. Each element repainted from black to white alters this count. 7. Calculate the repainted cells mathematically: [ text{Total repainted cells} = = 4(a + 25k) ] where a is the repainted cells in any 50 times 50 quadrant and 25k refers to the cells painted to balance it. 8. For total repainted cells to equal 2018, [ 4(a + 25k) = 2018 ] Notice, 2018 div 4 approx 504.5 which shows that repaint count being a multiple of 4 fails for exactly 2018. Insight: By continuing with the algebraic approach: a. Denote 2018 being repainted cells adjusted by white and black counts, where the total alterations in cells would either be even k or 4k, rendering a modular conflict: [ 2018 - 4(a + k) = 2(a + 2k) ] This forces a contradiction in consistent row and column counts unevictably proving impossibility: Thus, it proves to naturally balance counts via precise even multiple refinements clearly impossible.

When frac {1}{2} < a < frac {e}{2}, let g'(x)=0, we get x=ln (2a)in(0,1). Thus, the function g(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [0,ln (2a)], and monotonically increasing on the interval (ln (2a),1]. Consequently, the minimum value of g(x) on [0,1] is g(ln (2a))=2a-2aln (2a)-b. In summary, when aleqslant frac {1}{2}, the minimum value of g(x) on [0,1] is g(0)=1-b.

(2) Proof: Let x_{0} be a zero point of f(x) in the interval (0,1). Since f(0)=f(x_{0})=0, f(x) cannot be monotonically increasing or decreasing on the interval (0,x_{0}).

Similarly, g(x) has a zero point x_{2} in the interval (x_{0},1). Thus, g(x) has at least two zero points in the interval (0,1).

Because angle BDC and angle BEC are both right angles (90 degrees), the points B, D, E, C lie on a circle. In other words, quadrilateral BDEC is cyclic. This follows from the property that a cyclic quadrilateral opposite angles are supplementary (sum to 180^circ), but in this case, it suffices to note the right angles formed by the altitudes. 3. Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we know that: [ angle ADE = angle ACB. ] This is because angles subtended by the same arc in a circle are equal. 4. Since CD and BE are altitudes, let us consider the small triangle triangle ADE and the large triangle triangle ABC.

Clearly, ( n > 0 ). 2. **Considering the polynomial ( P(x) ) and its properties**: Since ( frac{p}{q} ) is a root of ( P(x) ), by the Rational Root Theorem, ( a_0 ) (the leading coefficient) must be divisible by ( q ).

This transforms our equation into: [ left(frac{a}{d}right)^5 + 2 left(frac{b}{d}right)^5 + 5 left(frac{c}{d}right)^5 = 11 ] 3. Multiplying through by (d^5) to clear the denominators, we get: [ a^5 + 2b^5 + 5c^5 = 11d^5 ] 4. Next, we consider this equation modulo 11. Utilizing the properties of exponents under modulo operations (specifically Fermat's Little Theorem, which tells us that (a^{11-1} equiv a pmod{11})), we need to analyze the possible values of (a^5, b^5,) and (c^5) modulo 11.

Thus, it is impossible for the entire chessboard to become black. The process ensures a rigorous check of parity maintenance, proving the impossibility as detailed. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The number of correct propositions is ( ( ) ( )).

The number of pure Fuji trees plus the cross-pollinated ones totals 238: F + 0.10T = 238 2. Three-quarters of all his trees are pure Fuji: F = 0.75T Now we can solve for T using the second equation: F = 0.75T T = F / 0.75 Substitute the value of T from the second equation into the first equation: F + 0.10(F / 0.75) = 238 Now solve for F: F + (0.10/0.75)F = 238 F + (1/7.5)F = 238 F(1 + 1/7.5) = 238 F(7.5/7.5 + 1/7.5) = 238 F(8.5/7.5) = 238 F = 238 * (7.5/8.5) F = 238 * (7.5/8.5) F = 238 * (15/17) F = 238 * (15/17) F = 210 Now that we have the number of pure Fuji trees (F), we can find the total number of trees (T): T = F / 0.75 T = 210 / 0.75 T = 280 Now we can find the number of pure Gala trees (G) by subtracting the number of pure Fuji trees and the cross-pollinated trees from the total number of trees: G = T - F - 0.10T G = 280 - 210 - 0.10(280) G = 280 - 210 - 28 G = 70 - 28 G = 42 So, there are boxed{42} pure Gala trees in the orchard."},{"prompt":"Find the solutions of the following system of equations in the set of nonnegative numbers: begin{aligned} x^{3}+y^{3}+3 x y & =1 x^{2}y^{2} & =1 end{aligned} Do we obtain other solutions if we only assume that x+y>0?","completion":"Given system of equations: [ begin{aligned} x^3 + y^3 + 3xy &= 1 quad text{(1)} x^2 - y^2 &= 1 quad text{(2)} end{aligned} ] **I.

The team can either win, draw, or lose with points allocated as follows: - Win: (2) points - Draw: (-1) point - Lose: (0) points 2. **Probability Calculation**: Given that both teams are equally matched, the probability of a draw in any match is ( p ). Therefore, the probability of either team winning (and hence the other losing) is ( frac{1-p}{2} ) for each team. 3. **Equality of Points Condition**: Teams ( A ) and ( B ) will have equal points after two matches in the following cases: - Both matches end in a draw. - One match is won by team ( A ) and the other by team ( B ). 4. **Calculation of Equal Points Probability**: - The probability of both matches ending in a draw is ( p^2 ). - The probability of team ( A ) winning one match and team ( B ) winning the other match (or vice versa) is given by: [ 2 cdot left(frac{1-p}{2}right) cdot left(frac{1-p}{2}right) = frac{(1-p)^2}{2} ] Here, we multiply by 2 to account for two combinations: ((A text{ wins first, B wins second}) ) and ((B text{ wins first, A wins second})). 5. **Total Probability of Equal Points**: The total probability ( f(p) ) of the teams having equal points is the sum of the probabilities from step 4: [ f(p) = p^2 + frac{(1-p)^2}{2} ] Simplifying this, we get: [ f(p) = p^2 + frac{1 - 2p + p^2}{2} = p^2 + frac{1}{2} - p + frac{p^2}{2} = frac{3p^2 - 2p + 1}{4} ] 6. **Behavior of the Function ( f(p) )**: To analyze how the function ( frac{3p^2 - 2p + 1}{4} ) behaves with respect to ( p ), we can study its derivative to understand where it increases or decreases. However, given its quadratic nature: - The quadratic function ( 3p^2 - 2p + 1 ) represents an upward-opening parabola. - The vertex of this parabola, corresponding to its minimum point, is at ( p = frac{-b}{2a} = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} ). 7. **Implication on Probability**: Since the function ( 3p^2 - 2p + 1 ) decreases on the interval ( left[0, frac{1}{3} right] ): - For ( p ) in this interval, increasing ( p ) does not necessarily increase ( f(p) ); it may decrease. - Thus, the probability of the teams receiving an equal number of points might actually decrease as ( p ) (the probability of a draw) increases from 0 to (frac{1}{3}). # Conclusion: Therefore, it is not always true that an increase in the probability ( p ) of a draw will increase the probability that teams ( A ) and ( B ) will end the two-match series with equal points.

Define a new function g(x) = frac{1}{2}(x + frac{1}{x}). The derivative of this function is g'(x) = frac{1}{2}(1 - frac{1}{x^2}).

We need to find the smallest distance from (2010) that the grasshopper can reach. 2. **Formulating the Problem:** Let (x) be the number of (364)-unit jumps and (y) be the number of (715)-unit jumps. The position of the grasshopper after (x) and (y) jumps is given by: [ 364x + 715y ] We need to find the smallest distance from (2010), i.e., we need to minimize: [ |2010 - (364x + 715y)| ] 3. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** To determine the possible values of (364x + 715y), we need to find the GCD of (364) and (715). Using the Euclidean algorithm: [ gcd(715, 364) = gcd(715 - 364 times 1, 364) = gcd(351, 364) ] [ gcd(364, 351) = gcd(364 - 351 times 1, 351) = gcd(13, 351) ] [ gcd(351, 13) = gcd(351 - 13 times 27, 13) = gcd(0, 13) = 13 ] Therefore, the GCD of (364) and (715) is (13). 4. **Expressing the Problem in Terms of the GCD:** Since the GCD is (13), any linear combination (364x + 715y) must be a multiple of (13). Thus, we need to find the smallest distance from (2010) to the nearest multiple of (13). 5. **Finding the Nearest Multiple of 13 to 2010:** We divide (2010) by (13) to find the nearest multiple: [ 2010 div 13 approx 154.615 ] The nearest integers are (154) and (155). Calculating the corresponding multiples: [ 13 times 154 = 2002 ] [ 13 times 155 = 2015 ] 6. **Calculating the Distances:** The distances from (2010) to these multiples are: [ |2010 - 2002| = 8 ] [ |2010 - 2015| = 5 ] 7. **Conclusion:** The smallest distance the grasshopper can be from (2010) is (5).

The number of factor pairs of (2022^2 = 2^2 times 3^2 times 337^2) can be calculated by first determining the number of factors: [ text{Number of factors} = (2+1)(2+1)(2+1) = 3 times 3 times 3 = 27. ] 9. Each of these 27 factors corresponds to a pair ((x - 2022, y - 2022)), and thus we initially find 54 pairs (since each factor pair can be arranged in two ways: ((a, b)) and ((b, a))). 10.

The numerator 1-frac{2}{m+1} simplifies to frac{m+1-2}{m+1} = frac{m-1}{m+1}. The denominator frac{m^2-2m+1}{m^2-m} can be rewritten by factoring the numerator as (m-1)^2 and the denominator as m(m-1).

Since C is the midpoint of AB, the distance from A to C is half the distance from A to B, which is frac{5}{2}.

One circle has 100 marked points, while the other has several arcs whose total length is less than 1 cm. We need to prove that we can align these circles in such a way that no marked point falls on a marked arc. 1. Consider fixing the second circle and rotating the first circle around it. 2. Let's imagine a painter attached to a point on the first circle, such that this painter paints a spot on a point of the second circle whenever the marked point on the first circle intersects a marked arc on the second circle. Explanation: - Each rotation of the first circle corresponds to the painter encountering at most 1 cm of the total marked arcs on the second circle. Argument: - As we rotate the first circle one full revolution (360 degrees), every marked point has the possibility of aligning with any marked arc on the second circle. - Since there are 100 marked points on the first circle, we need to perform up to 100 such revolutions. Calculation: - In each revolution, at most 1 cm is painted. - After 100 complete revolutions, the painter will have painted less than ( 100 times 1 = 100 ) cm. However, because the total length of marked arcs is less than 1 cm, in many rotations, no new length will be painted, or the same lengths might reoccur. Conclusion: - Therefore, every rotation results in less than 1 cm being painted. After 100 rotations, less than 100 cm would be painted altogether. - Hence, there will always be some remaining length of the circle that is unpainted because it never intersects a marked arc during these 100 revolutions. Thus, we conclude that it is possible to arrange the circles such that no marked point on the first circle coincides with any marked arc on the second circle.

We know that 1 km/hr is equivalent to 1000 m / 3600 s (since there are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 3600 seconds in an hour).

He needs to save up 20% of the cost of a 450,000 house for a downpayment. It will take him 6 years. What is Mike's annual salary?","completion":"To calculate Mike's annual salary, we first need to determine the total amount he needs to save for the downpayment on the house. The cost of the house is 450,000, and he needs to save 20% of that for the downpayment. So the downpayment amount is: Downpayment = 20% of 450,000 Downpayment = 0.20 * 450,000 Downpayment = 90,000 Mike plans to save this amount over 6 years. So the amount he needs to save each year is: Annual Savings = Total Downpayment / Number of Years Annual Savings = 90,000 / 6 Annual Savings = 15,000 per year Mike saves 10% of his annual salary each year. To find out his annual salary, we can set up the equation: Annual Savings = 10% of Annual Salary We know the Annual Savings is 15,000, so: 15,000 = 10% of Annual Salary 15,000 = 0.10 * Annual Salary To find the Annual Salary, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.10: Annual Salary = 15,000 / 0.10 Annual Salary = 150,000 Therefore, Mike's annual salary is boxed{150,000} ."},{"prompt":"Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, who has 12 peaches.

This means that the amount of salt in the water is: 5% of 200g = 0.05 * 200g = 10g This 10g of salt does not change even after the water evaporates because only the water evaporates, not the salt. After some water has evaporated, the salt concentration becomes 8%. Let's call the final weight of the salt water after evaporation W grams. The amount of salt is still 10g, which is now 8% of W. So we can set up the equation: 10g = 0.08 * W Now we solve for W: W = 10g / 0.08 = 125g This means that after evaporation, the weight of the salt water is 125g.

Consider two 93-sided polygons, (A: A_{1} A_{2} cdots A_{93}) and (B: B_{1} B_{2} cdots B_{93}), inscribed in a common circle. We need to show that the ratio (frac{A_{i} A_{i+1}}{B_{i} B_{i+1}}) is a constant independent of (i). 2. Construct another 93-sided polygon (C: C_{1} C_{2} cdots C_{93}) that is similar to polygon (B) and is inscribed in the same circle where polygon (A) is inscribed, such that for each (i), the edge (C_{i} C_{i+1}) is parallel to (A_{i} A_{i+1}). 3. By the similarity of (B) and (C), we have ( frac{A_{i} A_{i+1}}{C_{i} C_{i+1}} = c ), where (c) is some constant, because the corresponding sides of similar polygons inscribed in the same circle are proportional. 4. To formally prove this, let's denote the arc subtended by (A_{i} A_{i+1}) as (overparen{A_{i} A_{i+1}}) and similarly for (B_{i} B_{i+1}) and (C_{i} C_{i+1}). 5. Since (A_{i} A_{i+1} parallel C_{i} C_{i+1}), their respective subtended arcs (overparen{A_{i} A_{i+1}}) and (overparen{C_{i} C_{i+1}}) must be equal in measure, (widehat{A_{i} A_{i+1}} = widehat{C_{i} C_{i+1}}), but oriented in opposite directions. 6.

The arcs (overparen{A_{i}C_{i}}) and (overparen{C_{i+1}A_{i+1}}) are thus directly opposite. 8. Consequently, the subtended arcs and their lengths must either coincide or be symmetrical across the center, leading to: [ overparen{A_{1}C_{1}} = 0^circ text{ or } 180^circ, ] implying that polygon (C) must superimpose polygon (B) exactly or act as a symmetrical counterpart with respect to the circle's center. 9.

The center (h, k) of the circle is found by transforming the equation into (x+2)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=r^{2}. Thus, the center is at (-2,3).

This is due to the nature of the operation: one piece becomes two pieces. 3. **Desired Outcome:** - We need each of these tiles to be separated into (40) individual pieces of size (1 times 1). 4. **Step-by-Step Process:** - Initially, there is one whole chocolate bar, (1) piece. - To reach (40) pieces from an initial piece, every break action splits one piece into two, thus increasing the total number of pieces by one. - If we denote the number of breaks as (n), then starting from (1) piece, the total number of pieces after (n) breaks is (1 + n). 5. **Determine the Number of Breaks:** - To achieve (40) pieces, we need: [ 1 + n = 40 ] - Solving for (n): [ n = 40 - 1 = 39 ] 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, it requires exactly (39) breaks to split the (4 times 10) chocolate bar into (40) individual (1 times 1) tiles. boxed{39}"},{"prompt":"the following statement true?

Utilizing the difference of squares, we write: [ y^2 - x^2 = (y - x)(y + x) = 6q ] 4. Observing that ( 6q ) must be even, it implies that both ( y - x ) and ( y + x ) must be even (since ( y ) and ( x ) must both be integers). 5. Given that ( q ) is a prime and ( 6q ) being divisible by 4 indicates ( q ) must be even. The only even prime number is: [ q = 2 ] 6. Substituting ( q = 2 ) into the equation ( 6q ), we get: [ 6q = 6 cdot 2 = 12 ] 7. Therefore, we rewrite the equation ( 6q ) as: [ (y - x)(y + x) = 12 ] 8.

The given expression for (P) is: [ P = frac{[a, b]}{a + 1} + frac{[a, b]}{b + 1} = frac{dmn}{dm + 1} + frac{dmn}{dn + 1} ] 4. Since (gcd(m, n) = 1), we have (gcd(d, dm+1) = gcd(d, dn+1) = 1). Therefore, (d) must divide (P). This implies that (d) is either 1 or a prime number. 5. Suppose (d) is a prime (p). Then the equation becomes: [ P = frac{pmn}{pm + 1} + frac{pmn}{pn + 1} ] 6. Since (gcd(m, pm+1) = 1), (m) must divide (pn+1). Similarly, (n) must divide (pm+1). Let (pn + 1 = km) and (pm + 1 = ln).

If (p) divides (k), then (p) divides (km = pn + 1), which implies (p = 1), a contradiction. Therefore, (p) does not divide (k) or (l). Hence, (k) must equal (l), implying (m = n).

Similarly, (n) must divide (m + 1 = n + 2), so (n = 1) or (2). This leads to (P = frac{5}{3}) or (frac{7}{2}), both of which do not work. 14. If (P) divides (n), since (P > frac{n}{2}), (P = n).

According to the information given, the hourly wage of a dishwasher is half as much as that of a manager. Therefore, the hourly wage of a dishwasher (D) is: D = M / 2 The hourly wage of a chef is 20% greater than that of a dishwasher. To find 20% of the dishwasher's wage, we multiply the dishwasher's wage by 20% (or 0.20): 20% of D = 0.20 * D So the hourly wage of a chef (C) is: C = D + (0.20 * D) C = D * (1 + 0.20) C = D * 1.20 We are also told that a chef earns 3 less than a manager each hour. Therefore: C = M - 3 Now we can substitute the expression for C in terms of D into the equation above: D * 1.20 = M - 3 Since we know that D = M / 2, we can substitute this into the equation: (M / 2) * 1.20 = M - 3 Now we solve for M: 0.60 * M = M - 3 To isolate M, we move all terms involving M to one side of the equation: 0.60 * M - M = -3 Combine like terms: -0.40 * M = -3 Now divide both sides by -0.40 to solve for M: M = -3 / -0.40 M = 7.5 Therefore, the hourly wage of a manager is boxed{7.50} ."},{"prompt":"ershel has 10 betta fish and 15 goldfish in a bowl.

Given that among any ( k ) of these sets, there are two with a nonempty intersection, we need to prove that there exists a set ( X ) of ( k-1 ) integers such that each ( S_i ) contains at least one integer in ( X ). 2. **Construct the sequence ( {b_i} ):** Let ( a_i ) be the maximum integer in ( S_i ) for each ( i ). Define a sequence ( {b_j} ) as follows: - ( b_1 = min{a_i} ) - For ( j geq 1 ), ( b_{j+1} = min{a_i mid S_i cap b_j = emptyset} ) 3. **Properties of the sequence ( {b_i} ):** Clearly, ( b_1 < b_2 < cdots < b_m ). We must have ( m leq k-1 ) because the ( m ) sets corresponding to the ( b_i ) do not intersect.

This implies that all elements of ( S_t ) lie between ( b_l ) and ( b_{l+1} ) for some ( l ). However, this leads to a contradiction: - If ( S_t cap b_l = emptyset ), then ( a_t < b_{l+1} ) - By definition, ( b_{l+1} = min{a_i mid S_i cap b_l = emptyset} ) - Since ( S_t cap b_l = emptyset ), ( a_t ) should be considered in the minimum, contradicting ( a_t < b_{l+1} ) 5. **Conclusion:** It follows that each ( S_i ) intersects the set ( X' = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_m} ) for all ( i ).

However, this does not satisfy the total score constraint which states that the total score of both players should add up to 62 (31 each) across all games. Hence, ( A ) must lose the second game and win the third game to make the total score add up correctly. 3. Let's calculate the least difference needed for ( A ) and ( B )'s scores so that ( B ) wins the second game. The maximum difference for each game is 2 points because a game is won by at least 2 points (if tied at 10:10, the winner would be at ( 12 ) points against ( 10 )). 4.

Find the nearest preceding year and the nearest subsequent year to 1928 in which February also had 5 Wednesdays.

This provides more opportunities for a specific day (like Wednesday) to occur 5 times. 2. **Determination of Year:** Starting from the Gregorian calendar reform in 1752, a pattern emerges where February with 5 instances of the same weekday repeats every 28 years. The calculation for this pattern is based on the alignment of weekday cycles over a 4-year leap year period, modulo 7 (since there are 7 days in a week). 3. **Calculation by Enumeration:** We start enumerating the years by adding 28 years to each identified year until the given year 1928: - Starting from 1752 (not a leap year): - (1764) (next closest leap year after 1752 with the same pattern) - adding 28 years to 1764: [ 1764 + 28 = 1792 ] - adding 28 years to 1792: [ 1792 + 28 = 1820 ] - adding 28 years to 1820: [ 1820 + 28 = 1848 ] - adding 28 years to 1848: [ 1848 + 28 = 1876 ] - noting that some years are skipped depending on divisibility rules and re-alignment needed every 100 years (like 1800 which was not a leap year): - The pattern adjusts after 1800, jumping to: [ 1832, 1860, 1888 ] 4. **Locating Years Near 1928:** To find the closest preceding and subsequent years around 1928 we continue adding 28: - From 1888: [ 1888 + 28 = 1916 ] - Continuing on, 1928 is already given as the year of interest. - For subsequent years past 1928: [ 1928 + 28 = 1956 ] - Additional years could then follow as: [ 1956 + 28 = 1984 ] [ 1984 + 28 = 2012 ] 5. **Conclusion:** Based on this enumeration and applying the 28-year cycle with corrected adjustments, the nearest preceding year to 1928 wherein February had 5 Wednesdays is 1888, and the nearest subsequent year is 1956.

Therefore, the two functions have only one intersection point in the interval left[0, frac{pi}{2}right]. When x > frac{pi}{2}, y=|x|=x > frac{pi}{2} > 1, y=cos x leqslant 1. Therefore, the two functions have no intersection points in the interval left(frac{pi}{2}, +inftyright). Thus, the graphs of y=|x| and y=cos x have only one intersection point in the interval left[0, +inftyright). Since both functions are even functions and their graphs are symmetric about the y-axis, they also have only one intersection point in the interval (-infty, 0]. In summary, the number of intersection points between the graphs of y=|x| and y=cos x is 2. Therefore, the number of zeros of the function f(x)=|x|-cos x is 2.

For a in [-1,1], g(a) > 0 must hold. - Evaluating g(-1) > 0 gives -(x^{2}-x)-2x+2 > 0, which simplifies to -x^{2}+3x-2 < 0. - Evaluating g(1) > 0 gives x^{2}-3x+2 > 0. Solving these inequalities gives -2 < x < 1, so the range of x is boxed{(-2,1)}. Part (3): The Range of Real Number a Given m > 0, let k = m + frac{1}{m} + 1 geq 3.

This implies a < -2 and, with k geq 3, substituting k=3 gets us a^{2}+8a+4 > 0.

Notice that 1+(1-a)^2 = 1 + 1 - 2a + a^2 = 2 - 2a + a^2 = (1-a)^2 + a^2 = 1+a^2, which means that the denominators of both fractions are the same. Thus, we can combine them into a single fraction: f(a) + f(1-a) = frac{a}{1+a^2} + frac{1-a}{1+a^2} = frac{a + 1 - a}{1+a^2} = frac{1}{1+a^2}. Since 0 < a < 1, it follows that a^2 > 0. Therefore, 1 + a^2 > 1, which implies that frac{1}{1+a^2} < 1. Now, we can evaluate the expression for two particular cases: a and 1-a. Based on the symmetry: f(a) + f(1-a) = frac{1}{1+a^2} + frac{1}{1+(1-a)^2} = frac{1}{1+a^2} + frac{1}{1+a^2} = frac{2}{1+a^2}. Since a^2 < 1, it follows that 1+a^2 < 2. Thus, frac{2}{1+a^2} > 1.

Our goal is to determine if it's possible to select one point on each line such that the selected points form the vertices (i) of a trapezoid, (ii) of a parallelogram. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Construct Parallel Planes**: - Construct planes ( alpha supset a ) and ( beta supset b ) such that ( alpha ) is parallel to ( beta ). - Similarly, construct planes ( gamma supset c ) and ( delta supset d ) such that ( gamma ) is parallel to ( delta ). 2. **Direction for Projection**: - Consider an arbitrary direction vector ( vec{v} ) that is not parallel to any of these planes. - Project line ( a ) along the direction ( vec{v} ) onto the plane ( beta ), and denote the point of intersection with line ( b ) as ( B ). Let ( A in a ) be the original point before projection. - Similarly, project line ( c ) along the direction ( vec{v} ) onto plane ( delta ), intersecting at point ( D ). Let ( C in c ) be the original point corresponding to the projection. 3. **Form Parallel Line Segments**: - Line segment ( AB ) will be parallel to ( vec{v} ).

The intersection with ( z = 0 ) is a circle. - Each point on this circle is traversed by exactly two lines lying entirely on ( H ). These lines form two families: - Lines in one family intersect each other, and lines from different families cross each other. 5. **Analyzing Families**: - Any three pairwise skew lines, not parallel to the same plane, can be affine transformed to any other set of three lines satisfying these constraints. 6. **Combining Findings**: - For four skew lines ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ), choose ( A, B, ) and ( C = a'_{fam}, b'_{fam}, c'_{fam} ) from one family such that they meet the condition of not lying in a single plane. - Similarly, ensure that line ( d ) intersects with these but follows the intersecting pattern. 7. **Affine Properties**: - Using the affine properties of hyperboloids (as each line on ( H ) intersects or crosses other distinct families), ensure the formation of a quadrilateral, excluding special cases involving planes. 8. **Final Considerations**: - For case (a), it's evident from the hyperboloid properties that at least a trapezoid is formed. - For case (b), ensuring a parallelogram specifically: - By organizing the arrangement of parallel planes and their intersections carefully. - Ensuring disparity in segment lengths ((|AB| neq |CD|)).

Consequently, triangle O B_1 C_1 is similar to the triangle with vertices at the midpoints of segments AD, AC, and BD. 4. **Parallelism**: Since MK and KN are the midlines of triangles ACD and DAB respectively, these midlines are parallel to the corresponding sides of triangle OB_1C_1. Therefore, MK parallel OB_1 and KN parallel OC_1. 5. **Perpendicularity**: In an isosceles triangle such as triangle OB_1C_1, the angle bisector is also the altitude, hence it is perpendicular to the base B_1C_1. Since MK and KN are parallel to B_1C_1, the line MN is perpendicular to the angle bisector of angle AOD. Thus, we have shown by the first method that the line passing through the midpoints of the diagonals is perpendicular to the angle bisector of angle AOD. Second Method: 1. **Denote Angle**: Let angle AOD = 2alpha. 2. **Project Midpoints**: Let M_1 and N_1 be the projections of midpoints M and N of the diagonals AC and BD onto the angle bisector of angle AOD. 3. **Use Trigonometric Relationships**: Since these points are projections, we can express OM_1 and ON_1 in terms of their respective sides and the cosine of the angle alpha: [ OM_1 = frac{1}{2}(OA + OC) cos alpha , quad ON_1 = frac{1}{2}(OD + OB) cos alpha ] 4. **Properties of Segments**: Notice that: [ OA + OC = AB + OB + OC = CD + OB + OC = OD + OB ] Therefore: [ OM_1 = ON_1 ] 5. **Coincidence of Projections**: Since OM_1 = ON_1, the projections M_1 and N_1 coincide. This leads to the conclusion that the line MN passing through the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD is indeed perpendicular to the angle bisector of angle AOD. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"A store ordered 300 more than twice as many pens as it did pencils at 5 each. The cost of a pencil was 4, and the store ordered 15 boxes, each having 80 pencils. Calculate the total amount of money they paid for the stationery.","completion":"First, let's calculate the total number of pencils the store ordered. Since there are 15 boxes with 80 pencils each, the total number of pencils is: 15 boxes * 80 pencils/box = 1200 pencils The cost of each pencil is 4, so the total cost for the pencils is: 1200 pencils * 4/pencil = 4800 Now, let's calculate the number of pens the store ordered. The store ordered 300 more than twice as many pens as pencils. So the number of pens is: Twice the number of pencils + 300 = 2 * 1200 pencils + 300 = 2400 + 300 = 2700 pens The cost of each pen is 5, so the total cost for the pens is: 2700 pens * 5/pen = 13500 Finally, to find the total amount of money they paid for the stationery, we add the total cost for the pencils and the total cost for the pens: Total cost for pencils + Total cost for pens = 4800 + 13500 = 18300 So, the store paid boxed{18,300} for the stationery."},{"prompt":"The average of a set of numbers including 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 9, 10, and x is 7.

The sum of the given numbers without x is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 10 = 46 Let's denote the sum including x as S. So, S = 46 + x. Now we can use the average formula: 7 = (46 + x) / 9 To find x, we multiply both sides by 9: 7 * 9 = 46 + x 63 = 46 + x Now, we subtract 46 from both sides to solve for x: 63 - 46 = x x = 17 Therefore, the value of x is boxed{17} ."},{"prompt":"Alan, Bella, Claire, Dora, and Erik met together and shook hands exactly once with everyone they already knew.

Formally, if the operation is applied to a set of integers {x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}}, then irrespective of the operation: sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i quad text{is constant}. 2. **Defining the Function F(X)**: For any set of integers X = {x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5}}, we define the function: F(X) = sum_{i=1}^{5} (x_i - x_{i+2})^2, where x_{i+5} = x_i (considering the periodicity of the indices around the circle). 3. **Applying the Operation**: Let x_i < 0 and consider the new set Y = {x_{i-2}, x_{i-1} + x_i, -x_i, x_{i+1} + x_i, x_{i+2}}. We need to evaluate F(Y) and compare it with F(X). 4. **Calculating F(X) and F(Y)**: By direct calculation, due to the symmetry and periodic boundary conditions in the indices, the difference: F(X) - F(Y) = -2x_i left(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 right). 5. **Inequality**: Given that sum_{i=1}^{5} x_i > 0 (as indicated by the problem that the sum of the integers is positive), and since x_i < 0, we have: -2x_i left(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 right) > 0, hence, F(Y) < F(X). 6. **Conclusion**: The above inequality shows that F(X), which is a non-negative integer, strictly decreases under the given operations whenever x_i < 0. This process of strictly decreasing positive integers cannot continue indefinitely. 7. **Residual State**: Therefore, the reductions will eventually stop, and the only stable configuration is when all integers are non-negative.

This identity holds for all values of x and is the basis for our analysis. # Step 1: Establishing Sufficiency We first examine the statement \\"sin x = -1\\" to determine if it is a sufficient condition for \\"cos x = 0\\". - Given sin x = -1, we substitute this into the trigonometric identity: (-1)^2 + cos^2x = 1 implies 1 + cos^2x = 1. - Simplifying the equation, we find that cos^2x = 0, which implies cos x = 0. Thus, when sin x = -1, it necessarily follows that cos x = 0. This establishes the sufficiency of the condition. # Step 2: Examining Necessity Next, we evaluate whether \\"cos x = 0\\" is a necessary condition for \\"sin x = -1\\". - Given cos x = 0, we substitute this into the trigonometric identity: sin^2x + (0)^2 = 1 implies sin^2x = 1. - This implies that sin x = pm 1, which means sin x can be either 1 or -1.

[ sin alpha + cos alpha = sqrt{2} sin left(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right) ] This can be derived by recognizing the identity: [ sin alpha + cos alpha = sqrt{2} left( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} sin alpha + frac{1}{sqrt{2}} cos alpha right) = sqrt{2} sin left(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right) ] 2. **Apply the bounds of the sine function**: Since ( sin theta leq 1 ) for any angle (theta), [ sqrt{2} sin left(alpha + frac{pi}{4}right) leq sqrt{2} ] This equality holds when (alpha + frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2}), implying (alpha = frac{pi}{4}). 3. **Geometric interpretation using the unit circle**: Let's illustrate using the unit circle. Consider a unit circle centered at (O) with a point (M) on the circle such that (angle NOM = alpha). - Let (N) be the intersection of the terminal side of (alpha) with the unit circle and draw the perpendicular from (N) to the x-axis, meeting it at (M_1). - From (N), draw a line parallel to the x-axis meeting the y-axis at (M'). By construction, (B_{1}M = M_{1}M) and also (MN = MA_1). Hence, [ A_{1}B_{1} = M_{1}M + MN = cos alpha + sin alpha ] 4. **Inequality involving the length (A_{1}B_{1})**: - In the quadrilateral (A A_{1} B_{1} B), since it forms a right triangle, the maximum length (A_{1}B_{1} leq AB = sqrt{2}). - From this, we conclude: [ cos alpha + sin alpha leq sqrt{2} ] - The equality holds if and only if (alpha = frac{pi}{4}). # Conclusion: Thus, we confirm that: [ sin alpha + cos alpha leq sqrt{2}, quad alpha in left(0, frac{pi}{2}right) ] (boxed{sin alpha + cos alpha leq sqrt{2}})."},{"prompt":"Consider a sequence x_1, x_2, x_3, dots defined by begin{align*} x_1 &= sqrt[4]{4}, x_2 &= (sqrt[4]{4})^{sqrt[4]{4}}, end{align*} and in general, [x_n = (x_{n 1})^{sqrt[4]{4}}]for n > 1.

There are 20 gentlemen, and we need to determine the maximum number of handshakes that can occur, given that no three gentlemen are all mutually acquainted. This implies no subset of three gentlemen can all know each other, forming a clique of size 3. **Step 2:** Establish the graph theory context. We can model the problem with an undirected graph ( G ) where each vertex represents a gentleman, and an edge between two vertices represents mutual acquaintance. The problem states that ( G ) contains no triangles (no ( K_3 ) subgraph). **Step 3:** Use Turán's theorem. Turán's theorem gives an upper limit on the number of edges in a triangle-free graph. Specifically, Turán's theorem for ( K_3 ) (denoted as ( T(2, n) )) tells us the maximum number of edges ( E ) in a graph with ( n ) vertices that does not contain a ( K_3 ) is [ E leq leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor ] Given ( n = 20 ) for our problem: [ E leq leftlfloor frac{20^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{400}{4} rightrfloor = 100 ] **Step 4:** Verify the calculation. [ leftlfloor frac{20^2}{4} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 100 rightrfloor = 100 ] Thus, the upper bound is 100 handshakes. **Step 5:** Construct a scenario to achieve this number. We can divide the 20 gentlemen into two groups of 10. Suppose: - Group A: ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{10}} ) - Group B: ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{10}} ) Each gentleman in Group A knows all gentlemen in Group B, but no gentleman within Group A knows another within the same group, and similarly for Group B. This configuration ensures every possible handshake occurs between the groups and none within a single group. - Handshakes between A and B: ( 10 times 10 = 100 ) - Handshakes within groups: (0) (no mutual acquaintances within Group A or Group B) Thus, we achieve the maximum number of 100 handshakes with 20 gentlemen. **Conclusion:** The maximum number of handshakes that can be achieved is [ boxed{100} ]"},{"prompt":"an won 100 in the lottery.

Further Analysis: - Point ( P ) lies on ( k_1 ), centered at ( A ) and radius ( AP ), and lies on an arc ( i ) such that ( A ) and ( C ) subtend an angle ( 180^circ - frac{beta}{2} ) from ( i ). - Given that these loci intersect and point ( P ) satisfies the conditions above, we can intersect ( AP ) with the circle ( k ) to locate ( D ). 7. Position Confirmation: - Such the point ( D ) should properly satisfy the property of the tangential quadrilateral: [ DA + BC = AB + DC ] - This indicates that quadrilateral ( ABCD ) is inscribed with a circle, thus confirming ( D ) is correctly found on the opposite arc. 8. Conclusion: - We have verified through construction and properties of angles and sides that the point ( D ) correctly results in a tangential quadrilateral. - This concludes that ( D ) rightly marks the point on circle ( k ).

Vehicle Robots: Michael has 20 vehicle robots, and he has 25% more than Tom. To find out how many vehicle robots Tom has, we need to work backward from Michael's number. If Michael has 25% more, we can say that Michael's number of vehicle robots is 125% of Tom's number (since 100% would be the same amount, and Michael has an additional 25%). Let's denote the number of vehicle robots Tom has as ( V ). Then, Michael's number of vehicle robots is ( 1.25V ). We know Michael has 20 vehicle robots, so we can set up the equation: ( 1.25V = 20 ) To find ( V ), we divide both sides by 1.25: ( V = frac{20}{1.25} ) ( V = 16 ) So, Tom has 16 vehicle robots.

The equation of the line using point-slope form at point (2, 8) is: y - 8 = frac{3}{4}(x - 2). Substituting x = 6, we find: y = 8 + frac{3}{4}(6 - 2) = 11. The point (6,11) lies on the line containing (2,8) and (14,17). For k = 11, we get a degenerate triangle (zero area). For maximum area, we consider k = 10 and k = 12 (one unit below and above 11, respectively). The area will be maximum when the height from (6,k) to line ell is maximized, which occurs when k is farthest from 11, maintaining integer values. We calculate the height when k=10 or k=12, both differing by 1 from 11: text{Area} propto |k - 11| = 1.

Substituting the given radius, we get C = 2pi times 2 = 4pi. 3. **Relate the Circumference to the Sector's Arc Length:** When the lateral surface of the cone is unwrapped, it forms a sector of a circle. The length of the arc of this sector is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone. The formula for the arc length of a sector is frac{n}{360} times 2pi r, where n is the central angle in degrees. Given the slant height as the radius of this sector, we substitute l for r in the formula, getting frac{n}{360} times 2pi times 6. 4. **Set Up the Equation and Solve for n:** Equating the arc length to the circumference of the base, we have 4pi = frac{n}{360} times 2pi times 6. Simplifying, we find 4pi = frac{npi times 6}{180}. Further simplification gives 4 = frac{n times 6}{180}. Solving for n, we multiply both sides by 180 and divide by 6, yielding n = frac{4 times 180}{6} = 120. Therefore, the central angle of the sector formed when the lateral surface of the cone is unwrapped is boxed{120^{circ}}. This step-by-step solution demonstrates how to calculate the central angle of the sector based on the given dimensions of the cone, using the relationship between the circumference of the base and the arc length of the sector."},{"prompt":"A dishonest shopkeeper professes to sell pulses at the cost price, but he uses a false weight of 980 gm for a kg. What is his gain percentage?","completion":"The shopkeeper is using a false weight of 980 grams instead of the true weight of 1000 grams (1 kg). This means that for every kilogram he claims to sell, he is actually selling 980 grams. To calculate his gain percentage, we need to determine how much more he is selling the pulses for compared to what he should be selling if he were honest. The actual weight he is selling is 980 grams, but he is charging for 1000 grams. So, the gain for every 980 grams is 1000 - 980 = 20 grams. To find the gain percentage, we use the formula: Gain Percentage = (Gain / Actual Weight) * 100 Plugging in the values, we get: Gain Percentage = (20 / 980) * 100 Gain Percentage = (20 / 980) * 100 = (2 / 98) * 100 = (1 / 49) * 100 ≈ 2.04% So, the shopkeeper's gain percentage is approximately boxed{2.04%} ."},{"prompt":"The ratio of the surface area of a cube's inscribed sphere (inner tangent sphere) to its circumscribed sphere (outer tangent sphere) is _______.","completion":"Let's denote the edge length of the cube as a.

Substituting this into the definition of (b_{n+1}): [ b_{n+1} = 4a_{2n} + 4. ] 9. Using the definition of (b_n): [ b_n = a_{2n} + 4 implies a_{2n} = b_n - 4. ] 10.

Therefore: [ 2^{1007} = 2^{40 cdot 25 + 7} = (2^{40})^{25} cdot 2^7 equiv 1^{25} cdot 2^7 equiv 2^7 pmod{100}. ] 16. Calculating (2^7): [ 2^7 = 128 implies 128 mod 100 = 28. ] 17.

Given alpha geq beta geq gamma, it follows that gamma leq 180^circ - 3gamma leq alpha, which implies 4gamma leq 180^circ leq 5gamma, therefore 36^circ leq gamma leq 45^circ. Thus, 180^circ - 3 times 45^circ leq 180^circ - 3gamma leq 180^circ - 3 times 36^circ which means 45^circ leq beta leq 72^circ. Hence, the answer is boxed{45^circ leq beta leq 72^circ}."},{"prompt":"bought a pair of shoes for 51, which included a 7% sales tax. The shoes were already marked 60% off, and then an additional 15% discount was applied. What is the original price of the shoes before any discounts and tax?","completion":"Let's denote the original price of the shoes as P. First, we need to find the price before tax was added. Since the final price includes a 7% sales tax, we can calculate the pre-tax price by dividing the final price by 1.07 (100% + 7% tax = 107%, which is the same as 1.07). Pre-tax price = 51 / 1.07 Now, let's calculate the pre-tax price: Pre-tax price = 51 / 1.07 ≈ 47.66 This pre-tax price of 47.66 includes the 60% off and an additional 15% discount. Let's denote the price after the 60% discount as D. The 60% off means the shoes are sold at 40% of the original price (100% - 60% = 40%), so: D = 0.40 * P Then, an additional 15% discount is applied to D, which means the shoes are sold at 85% of the price D (100% - 15% = 85%), so: Pre-tax price = 0.85 * D Substituting D with 0.40 * P, we get: 47.66 = 0.85 * (0.40 * P) Now, let's solve for P: 47.66 = 0.85 * 0.40 * P 47.66 = 0.34 * P P = 47.66 / 0.34 P ≈ 140.18 Therefore, the original price of the shoes before any discounts and tax was approximately boxed{140.18} ."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},W={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],N={key:0},E={key:1};function R(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",W,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
