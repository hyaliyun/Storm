First, let's find the LCM of 12 and 16: The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3. The prime factorization of 16 is 2^4. The LCM of 12 and 16 is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in either number. So, we take 2^4 (since it's the higher power of 2 compared to 2^2) and multiply it by 3 (since 3 does not appear in the factorization of 16). Therefore, the LCM of 12 and 16 is 2^4 * 3 = 16 * 3 = 48. Next, let's find the LCM of 18 and 24: The prime factorization of 18 is 2 * 3^2. The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3. The LCM of 18 and 24 is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in either number. So, we take 2^3 (since it's the higher power of 2 compared to 2) and multiply it by 3^2 (since it's the higher power of 3 compared to 3). Therefore, the LCM of 18 and 24 is 2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72. Now we have the LCM of 12 and 16, which is 48, and the LCM of 18 and 24, which is 72. We need to find the LCM of 48 and 72. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 * 3.

Since each pipe drains at the same rate, we can say that ( n cdot r = frac{1}{16} ). Now, if 15 additional pipes are added, making the total number of pipes ( n + 15 ), they can drain the pool in 4 days. So, the combined rate of ( n + 15 ) pipes is ( frac{1}{4} ) pool per day.

According to the information given: - 60 students preferred Mac to Windows. - 90 students had no preference. - 40 students preferred Windows to Mac. The total number of students surveyed is 210. To find the number of students who equally preferred both brands, we can subtract the number of students who had a preference (either Mac or Windows) and those who had no preference from the total number of students surveyed: E = Total students - (Preferred Mac + Preferred Windows + No preference) E = 210 - (60 + 40 + 90) E = 210 - 190 E = 20 So, 20 students equally preferred both brands.

Consider a 1993 times 1993 chessboard. Note that 1993 times 1993 is an odd dimension. 2. Let squares A and B be situated on the edges of the board, separated by an odd number of squares, which are marked out for removal. 3. Color the chessboard in a checkerboard pattern with black and white squares. We can assume the corners are black due to the dimensions being odd. 4. Given this coloring: - Both A and B must be black. - If either A or B were white, covering the board with 1 times 2 dominos (which each cover one black and one white square) would be impossible due to an imbalance in the number of black and white squares. 5. Let's evaluate the possible dominos covering the board T backslash A (the board without square A): - Start with a valid arrangement of dominos (i.e., a tiling) for Tbackslash A. - Identify the domino covering the square B. Let the domino cover tiles B = B_1 and B_2. - Shift this domino one space towards B_2 (away from B_1). 6. Notice that shifting B_1 to B_2 results in a domino now covering a new square B_3. Continue shifting the domino until we meet one of two conditions: - The sequence ends at the edge of the board. - The sequence forms a loop. However, it cannot form a loop. A loop implies an odd number of black squares remain uncovered, which contradicts our supposed initial valid tiling. Thus, the sequence must end at A: 7. Since every step consistently covers black and white equally, we can match each domino tiling of T backslash A to a domino tiling of T backslash B and vice-versa. 8.

The derivative of g(x) is: [ g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x - sin x) = 1 - cos x. ] Since cos x < 1 for 0 < x < 1, we have g'(x) > 0, indicating that g(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (0, 1). 3. **Analyze the monotonicity of f(x):** Given that g(x) = f'(x) and g(x) is monotonically increasing and always positive in (0, 1), it follows that f'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1. This means f(x) is also monotonically increasing in the interval (0, 1). 4. **Compare b and a:** Since f(x) is monotonically increasing, we have f(frac{1}{4}) > f(0) = 0.

This implies frac{sin frac{1}{4}}{cos frac{1}{4}} > frac{1}{4}, leading to 4sin frac{1}{4} > cos frac{1}{4}, hence c > b. Combining the comparisons, we conclude that c > b > a.

Now, let's calculate the total number of movies Timothy went to in both years: Timothy's total = 24 (2009) + 31 (2010) = 55 movies. Since the total number of movies they both went to in both years is 129, we can find out how many movies Theresa went to in both years: Theresa's total = 129 - Timothy's total = 129 - 55 = 74 movies. We already know Theresa went to 12 movies in 2009, so we can find out how many movies she went to in 2010: Theresa's 2010 movies = Theresa's total - Theresa's 2009 movies = 74 - 12 = 62 movies.

Let us define the arithmetic mean of the squares of the first n positive integers, denoted by frac{1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + n^2}{n}, to be a perfect square. Suppose: frac{1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + n^2}{n} = k^2 quad text{for some integer } k. 2. Using the well-known formula for the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers: frac{1^2 + 2^2 + cdots + n^2}{n} = frac{frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}}{n} = frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}. 3. This can be expressed as: frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = k^2. 4. Given that n geq 2, we analyze this fraction: frac{(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} geq frac{5 times 5}{6} = frac{25}{6} > 4 quad text{so } k^2 > 4 implies k geq 2. 5. Since 2n + 1 is always odd, it follows that n must be odd. Let n = 2m - 1, where m is an integer such that m geq 2. Substituting n: frac{1}{6} left(2m(4m - 1)right) = k^2 implies frac{1}{3} m(4m - 1) = k^2. 6. Therefore, m must be a multiple of 3 or 4m - 1 must be a multiple of 3. Let m = 3t for some integer t. Then: t(12t-1) = k^2. 7. Here, t and 12t - 1 are coprime and both must be perfect squares: 12t - 1 equiv 3 mod 4. 8. This implies that t must be even: t = 4j + 1. Substituting back, this gives us: (3j + 1)(4j + 1) = k^2, 9. Let (3j + 1) = a^2 and (4j + 1) = b^2, where a and b are suitable integers: 4j + 1 - (3j + 1) = j. 10. Since 4j + 1 and 3j + 1 are also coprime, they must both be squares: a^2 = 3j + 1 quad text{and} quad b^2 = 4j + 1. 11. Solving these equations, we have: j = frac{b^2 - 1}{4}, 12.

Since no full price tickets were sold during the first week, all of these were sold during the remaining weeks. Therefore, F = 16500. The problem states that the same number of tickets were sold at full price as were sold at reduced price during the remaining weeks. This means that R = F.

Given the distribution table: - For xi = 1, the probability is x. - For xi = 2, the probability is frac{1}{2}. - For xi = 3, the probability is y. The total probability must equal 1, so we set up the equation: [x + frac{1}{2} + y = 1.] Rearranging, we find that: [x + y = frac{1}{2}.] **Step 2**: Find the relationship between x and y to minimize frac{1}{x} + frac{4}{y}. Given frac{1}{x} + frac{4}{y}, we aim to minimize this expression under the constraint that x + y = frac{1}{2} and x > 0, y > 0.

Identify one vertex of the triangle. 2. Fold the paper such that two sides that meet at this vertex coincide, making sure the crease runs through the vertex. This crease is the bisector of the angle at this vertex. 5. **Repeating for Another Vertex**: Repeat the above step for another vertex of the triangle, creating the second angle bisector. 6. **Intersection of Angle Bisectors**: The point where these two angle bisectors intersect is the center of the inscribed circle.

Therefore, option A is correct. # Option B: If a=2, B=frac{pi}{3}, and the triangle has two solutions, then sqrt{3} < b < 2 - Given the triangle has two solutions, we have the inequality asin B < b < a. - Substituting a = 2 and B = frac{pi}{3}, we get 2sinfrac{pi}{3} < b < 2. - Simplifying, we find sqrt{3} < b < 2. Therefore, option B is correct. # Option C: If frac{tan A}{a^{2}} = frac{tan B}{b^{2}}, then triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle - From frac{tan A}{a^{2}} = frac{tan B}{b^{2}}, we get b^{2}frac{sin A}{cos A} = a^{2}frac{sin B}{cos B}. - Using the Law of Sines, frac{sin^{2}B}{sin^{2}A} = frac{sin A cos B}{sin B cos A}. - Simplifying, sin B cos B = sin A cos A. - This leads to sin 2B = sin 2A. - Therefore, 2B = 2A or 2B + 2A = pi, which implies A = B or A + B = frac{pi}{2}.

Thus, the coordinates of point C are (1, 2), or boxed{(1, 2)} for part (1). # Part 2: Given costheta = frac{sqrt{10}}{10} and |overrightarrow{OP}| = 2sqrt{10}, we find the sine using the Pythagorean identity sin^2theta + cos^2theta = 1: 1. Calculate sintheta: sintheta = sqrt{1 - (frac{sqrt{10}}{10})^2} = frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}. The coordinates of point P can be found by multiplying the cosine and sine of theta by the magnitude of overrightarrow{OP}: 1. For the x-coordinate: 2sqrt{10} cdot frac{sqrt{10}}{10} = 2. 2. For the y-coordinate: 2sqrt{10} cdot frac{3sqrt{10}}{10} = 6. Thus, the coordinates of point P are (2, 6), which means overrightarrow{OP} = (2, 6). Given the angle between overrightarrow{OP} and overrightarrow{OB} is 45^circ, we need to find point B's coordinates considering the given vectors and angles. However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the initial provided solution regarding the calculation of point B's coordinates under these constraints. The provided answer states that the coordinates of point B result in (-1, 2), which, under the assumption of calculating based on the angle and magnitude, would be reconsidered if necessary. However, following the logic provided, assuming overrightarrow{OB} incorrectly calculated as (-1, 2) leads to: Given overrightarrow{OP} = xoverrightarrow{OA} + yoverrightarrow{OB}, and setting up the equations: 1. For x and y-coordinates from overrightarrow{OP} = (2, 6), and overrightarrow{OA} = (1, 0), overrightarrow{OB} = (-1, 2), we get: - 2 = x - y - 6 = 2y 2. Solving the system of equations yields x = 5 and y = 3.

The quadrilateral should be such that any diagonal divides it into two isosceles triangles. Moreover, if both diagonals are drawn, the quadrilateral should be divided into four isosceles triangles.

If we consider its diagonals: - Both diagonals are equal in length. - Each diagonal divides the square into two congruent isosceles right triangles. - When both diagonals are drawn, four isosceles right triangles are formed.

Let’s denote the vertices of the isosceles trapezoid as A, B, C, and D such that AB and CD are the parallel sides with CD > AB. Suppose AD = BC = l and AB = CD - 2m. **Dividing via Diagonal:** Consider diagonal AC: - Triangle triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC. - Triangle triangle ACD is isosceles because AD = DC. Now consider diagonal BD: - Triangle triangle ABD is isosceles because AB = BD. - Triangle triangle BCD is isosceles because BC = CD. Thus, when we draw either diagonal, the trapezoid is divided into two isosceles triangles, satisfying the problem conditions. When both diagonals are drawn (AC and BD), each of the four created triangles will be isosceles. 3. **Conclusion:** Given that both a square and a specific type of isosceles trapezoid, such as one where the smaller base equals the non-parallel sides, satisfy the given conditions, we conclude that: The quadrilateral does not necessarily need to be a square.

The tetrahedron is rotated around the common edge of these faces, and we are tasked with finding the maximum projection area of the rotating tetrahedron on a plane that contains this edge. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Area of one triangular face:** The triangle face of the tetrahedron is a right isosceles triangle with the hypotenuse of 2. We need to find the legs of this triangle. - Using Pythagoras theorem in the right triangle: [ text{hypotenuse}^2 = text{leg}^2 + text{leg}^2 ] [ 2^2 = 2 cdot text{leg}^2 ] [ 4 = 2 cdot text{leg}^2 ] [ text{leg}^2 = 2 ] [ text{leg} = sqrt{2} ] - The area (S) of a triangular face is then: [ S = frac{1}{2} cdot text{leg} cdot text{leg} = frac{1}{2} cdot sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2} = frac{1}{2} cdot 2 = 1 ] Therefore, ( S = 1 ). 2. **Projection when triangle lies in the plane:** When one of the triangular faces lies in the projection plane, the projection of the tetrahedron's face equals the area of this face: [ Pi = S = 1 ] 3. **Projection while rotating the tetrahedron:** For a rotation angle (0 < varphi < 30^circ), the area of the projection is given by: [ Pi = S cos varphi < S = 1 ] 4. **Projection for (30^circ < varphi < 90^circ):** The area of the projection comprises contributions from both the faces: [ Pi = S cos varphi + S cos left( frac{2pi}{3} - varphi right) ] Using the trigonometric identity (cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B): [ cos left( frac{2pi}{3} - varphi right) = cos frac{2pi}{3} cos varphi + sin frac{2pi}{3} sin varphi ] Since (cos frac{2pi}{3} = -frac{1}{2}) and (sin frac{2pi}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}): [ cos left( frac{2pi}{3} - varphi right) = -frac{1}{2} cos varphi + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin varphi ] Substituting back: [ Pi = S cos varphi + S left( -frac{1}{2} cos varphi + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin varphi right) ] [ Pi = S cos varphi - frac{S}{2} cos varphi + frac{S sqrt{3}}{2} sin varphi ] Combining terms: [ Pi = frac{S}{2} cos varphi + frac{S sqrt{3}}{2} sin varphi ] Since (S=1): [ Pi = frac{1}{2} cos varphi + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin varphi ] 5. **Maximizing the Projection Area:** The maximum value of (Pi) within the defined intervals can be obtained by critical points analysis. At (varphi = 0): [ Pi = S = 1 ] When evaluated at (30^circ): [ Pi = S cos 30^circ = 1 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} < 1 ] Hence, the maximum projection area occurs when the tetrahedron face is lying flat in the projection plane.

According to the information given, the number of sharks in Pelican Bay was twice the number of pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. Therefore, the original number of sharks in Pelican Bay was 2P. However, we know that currently, there are 60 sharks in Pelican Bay. This means that the original number of sharks, which was twice the number of pelicans, was 60. So we can write the equation: 2P = 60 Now, we solve for P: P = 60 / 2 P = 30 This means that originally, there were 30 pelicans in Shark Bite Cove. Now, according to the information, one-third of the pelicans in Shark Bite Cove have moved to Pelican Bay.

This indicates a circle centered at (5, 0) with a radius of 5. The point (5, 3) is inside the circle. Since the chord lengths form an arithmetic progression with a common difference d, the chords are symmetrically arranged on both sides of the diameter perpendicular to the said chords and passing through point (5,3). We know that for an arithmetic series, the average value is the mean of the first and last term, which in this case would be the length of the chord passing through (5,3). This chord is perpendicular to a diameter of the circle, which we can find using the Pythagorean theorem. The distance from (5,3) to the diameter that lies along the y-axis is 3 units. Hence, the distance from (5,3) to the center of the circle (5,0) is 3 units. This means that on a circle with radius 5 units, the length of the chord through (5,3) can be calculated as follows: The radius perpendicular to the chord bisects the chord, so we can form a right-angled triangle with half the chord length and the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord. Let's call half the chord length l/2. By the Pythagorean theorem: [ (5)^2 = (3)^2 + left(frac{l}{2}right)^2 ] Solving for l: [ left(frac{l}{2}right)^2 = 5^2 - 3^2 ] [ left(frac{l}{2}right)^2 = 25 - 9 ] [ left(frac{l}{2}right)^2 = 16 ] [ frac{l}{2} = 4 ] [ l = 8 ] Thus, the chord length passing through (5,3) is 8 units. For the shortest and longest chords to also be part of this circle, their lengths must range from 0 to 2cdot5 = 10. The common difference d must divide the difference in length (8 - a_1) an integral number of times. The maximum value of k occurs when a_1 is minimized. Given d geq frac{1}{3} and k = frac{8 - a_1}{d} + 1, k decreases as a_1 increases. For k = 4, we can have a_1 = 8 - 3d. However, since d geq frac{1}{3}, the minimum possible length for a_1 would be 8 - 3left(frac{1}{3}right) = 7. This satisfies the condition that a_1 must be less than 8. For k = 6, we have a similar situation where a_1 could still be positive, with a_1 = 8 - 5d and d geq frac{1}{3}. For k = 7, we find that a_1 = 8 - 6d which implies a_1 geq 8 - 6left(frac{1}{2}right) = 5, which is still possible. However, for k = 5, the situation is different. We would have a_1 = 8 - 4d and d leq frac{1}{2}. If d = frac{1}{2}, then a_1 = 8 - 4left(frac{1}{2}right) = 6. If d = frac{1}{3}, then a_1 = 8 - 4left(frac{1}{3}right) = 8 - frac{4}{3} > 6. So for k = 5, the smallest a_1 can be is 6 which does not allow for a possible shortest chord length of more than 6 units within the constraints of the problem.

Then, the move ( M_k ) increases the vice-leading coefficient by ( k ).** **Proof of Lemma:** Let ( f(x) = sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i ), where ( a_n = 1 ). Therefore, [ frac{f(x) - f(k)}{x - k} = frac{sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^i - sum_{i=0}^n a_i k^i}{x - k} ] By polynomial division, this results in: [ frac{f(x) - f(k)}{x - k} = x^{n-1} + (k + a_{n-1}) x^{n-2} + cdots ] Here, the term ( k + a_{n-1} ) is the new vice-leading coefficient. Thus, the move ( M_k ) increases the vice-leading coefficient by ( k ). 2. **Using the Lemma:** Each move reduces the degree of the polynomial by 1 while increasing the vice-leading coefficient by the index of the move. To reduce each polynomial ( f_i(x) ) from degree ( n ) to degree 1, we need ( n-1 ) moves per polynomial. Since there are ( n ) polynomials, a total of ( n(n-1) ) moves are required. 3. **Ensuring Identical Linear Polynomials:** To ensure that all resulting polynomials are identical linear polynomials, the sum of the indices of the moves made on each polynomial must be equal. This is because the vice-leading coefficient must be the same for all polynomials after all moves are completed. 4. **Sum of Indices:** The sum of the indices of the moves made on each polynomial must be equal. The total sum of indices for all moves is: [ 1 + 2 + cdots + n(n-1) = frac{n(n-1)(n^2 - n + 1)}{2} ] For this sum to be divisible by ( n ), ( n ) must be odd. This is because the sum of the first ( n(n-1) ) natural numbers is divisible by ( n ) if and only if ( n ) is odd. 5. **Construction for Odd ( n ):** For odd ( n ), we can construct the sequence of moves as follows: - Apply the moves ( M_{2kn+i} ) and ( M_{2(k+1)n+1-i} ) on the polynomial ( f_i(x) ) for all ( k ) from 0 to ( frac{n-3}{2} ). - This ensures that all moves are covered exactly once and the vice-leading coefficients remain equal after each pair of moves. 6. **Conclusion:** Since the construction works for all odd ( n ), it is possible to make appropriate moves such that the process stops with a sequence of ( n ) identical polynomials of degree 1.

First, let's consider a cube with side length s. The space diagonal of a cube (the diagonal that runs from one corner of the cube to the opposite corner) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. If we consider a cube ABCDEFGH with A as the origin, and B, D, and E as the adjacent vertices, then the space diagonal would be the line segment from A to the opposite corner G. The length of the space diagonal (AG) can be calculated as follows: AG = √(AB^2 + AD^2 + AE^2) Since AB, AD, and AE are all edges of the cube with the same length s, we have: AG = √(s^2 + s^2 + s^2) AG = √(3s^2) AG = s√3 Now, let's consider the angle e formed by the intersection of the space diagonals of any two non-adjacent faces. Without loss of generality, let's consider the space diagonal AG of face ABCD and the space diagonal CH of face EFGH. These two diagonals intersect at the center of the cube. To find angle e, we can draw a right triangle where one leg is half the space diagonal (AG/2), the other leg is half the edge of the cube (s/2), and the hypotenuse is the radius of the sphere that circumscribes the cube (which is also half the space diagonal, AG/2). Using the definition of the cosine in a right triangle: cos(e) = adjacent side / hypotenuse cos(e) = (s/2) / (AG/2) cos(e) = (s/2) / (s√3/2) cos(e) = 1/√3 cos(e) = √3/3 Now, we can find the measure of angle e by taking the arccosine (inverse cosine) of √3/3: e = arccos(√3/3) Using a calculator, we find that: e ≈ 54.7356 degrees Therefore, the measure of angle e formed by the intersection of the space diagonals of any two non-adjacent faces of a cube is approximately boxed{54.7356} degrees."},{"prompt":"Let the universal set be U={1,2,3,4,5}, set M={1,4}, N={2,5}.

However, it does not necessarily follow that all given figures have a common point. Suppose we have the set of all upper halfplanes” bounded below by all possible horizontal lines. Every three such halfplanes have a common part; any finite number of halfplanes also have a common part. But if we keep adding halfplanes that are higher and higher, this common part moves up, so every point on the plane will eventually lie outside this common part of halfplanes. Thus, there is no single point that belongs to all upper halfplanes at once. However, if the considered figures are bounded, then by adding more and more figures to some of their set, the common part cannot escape to infinity; it will always remain in the bounded part of the plane. In this case, there must exist a point that belongs to all figures simultaneously. In other words, the following theorem by Helly holds: If bounded convex figures are given on a plane, either in a finite or infinite number, every three of which have a common point, then there exists a point belonging to all figures simultaneously.","completion":"Let's prove the theorem using the method of mathematical induction. 1. **Base Case**: For n = 3, each set of three convex figures has a common point.

Since each triple intersection must have a common point, any such P_i and any other intersection must include Phi_{n+1}. 6. **Applying Induction Hypothesis**: By the induction hypothesis, if we consider any n figures among Phi_1, Phi_2, ldots, Phi_{n+1}, there is a common point for these n figures. Since this includes all combinations that exclude one of the figures, there must be a point common to all the original n+1 figures. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, by induction, the assertion holds for n+1 figures.

Let the angles of the triangle be labeled as ( alpha, beta, gamma ) such that ( alpha leq beta leq gamma ). By these definitions, ( beta ) is the middle angle of the triangle. 2. Since ( beta ) is an angle of a triangle, it must be greater than ( 0^circ ). Therefore: [ beta > 0^circ ] 3. We also need to establish an upper bound for ( beta ). Given the triangle inequality and angle sum properties: [ 2beta leq beta + gamma < alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ, ] this simplifies to: [ 2beta < 180^circ implies beta < 90^circ ] 4.

To confirm that for any ( beta ) in the range ( 0^circ < beta < 90^circ ), there exists a triangle with angles ( alpha, beta, gamma ), where ( beta ) is the middle angle, let's consider constructing such a triangle: - Let ( alpha ) be the minimum of ( beta ) and ( 90^circ - beta ): [ alpha = min{beta, 90^circ - beta} ] This means: [ alpha > 0^circ quad text{and} quad alpha leq beta ] - Also, since ( alpha leq 90^circ - beta ): [ alpha + beta leq 90^circ - beta + beta = 90^circ ] 6.

The derivative of m(x) is: [m'(x) = -2x - frac{1}{x}] Since -2x - frac{1}{x} < 0 for all x > 0, m(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0, +infty). Knowing that m(1) = 0, we can deduce that for x > 1, m(x) < 0, which implies h'(x) < 0 and therefore h(x) is monotonically decreasing. Conversely, for 0 < x < 1, m(x) > 0, which implies h'(x) > 0 and h(x) is monotonically increasing. Since h(x) increases up to x = 1 and then decreases, its maximum value occurs at x = 1. Evaluating h(x) at this point gives: [h(1) = frac{ln 1}{1} - 1 = -1] Therefore, since h(x) is decreasing for x > 1, the maximum value of a is -1, and a can take any value less than or equal to this maximum.

The time the train is completely on the bridge, which is 40 seconds. The length of the train can be represented as the distance it travels to completely get on the bridge, plus the length of the bridge, and then the distance it travels to completely leave the bridge.

Let's translate this problem: adding frac{1}{5} to all vertices transforms it into 0, 0, 0, 0, 1. Therefore, our goal is to determine if it's possible to turn the numbers 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 into 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 using the given operation. 2. **Properties of Binary Rationals:** Notice that initially all the numbers are in the fractional form frac{k}{2^m} where k is an integer and m is a non-negative integer. Let’s call such numbers “binary rationals”. 3. **Operation Verification**: When we perform the given operation (replacing two adjacent numbers with their arithmetic mean), the result for adjacent numbers a and b is: [ text{New values} = left(frac{a+b}{2}, frac{a+b}{2}right) ] In this operation, if both a and b are binary rationals, frac{a+b}{2} will also be a binary rational. This is because the sum of two binary rationals is a binary rational and division by 2 (or multiplication by frac{1}{2}) still yields a binary rational. 4. **Checking 1 = frac{4}{5} Transformation:** By our transformation step, the original problem is equivalent to analyzing starting from 0, 0, 0, 0, 1. Let’s check whether 1 can turn into a binary rational through these operations using the arithmetic mean method. Observe: [ 1 = frac{1}{1} = frac{2^m}{2^m} quad text{(Not changing into a different form contrary to our condition of sustaining binary form)} ] 5. **Impossibility Proof:** The number frac{1}{5} is not a binary rational. frac{1}{5} cannot be written in the form {k}/{2^m} as it involves a factor of 5 in the denominator which is not a power of 2. Therefore, any operation involving the arithmetic mean, starting from binary rational numbers and aiming to achieve frac{1}{5} is not possible. This implies that starting from - frac{1}{5}, - frac{1}{5}, - frac{1}{5}, - frac{1}{5}, frac{4}{5} (or equivalently, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1), it is impossible to achieve the five zeroes. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the locus of points P in the plane of a square ABCD such that max{ PA, PC}=frac12(PB+PD). *(Anonymous314)*","completion":"1. **Set up the coordinate system:** Let the vertices of the square (ABCD) be (A(-1, 1)), (B(1, 1)), (C(1, -1)), and (D(-1, -1)).

This follows from the property of cyclic quadrilaterals where opposite angles sum up to (180^circ). 2. **Conclusion for Quadrilateral (MLDH):** (MLDH) is a cyclic quadrilateral. The diameter is (MD) because the quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle which must pass through all its vertices. 3. **Equal Lengths and Another Quadrilateral:** Given that (KH = frac{1}{2} AB = AK = DL), we need to establish the nature of the quadrilateral (KLDH). - Here, the equality (KH = frac{1}{2} AB = AK = DL) implies that sides (KH), (AK), and (DL) are equal. - To explore the properties of quadrilateral (KLDH), note that (KH = DL) and (AK = AK). Since these segments are equal, (KLDH) forms an isosceles trapezoid. 4. **Inscribed Isosceles Trapezoid:** Since (KLDH) is an isosceles trapezoid: - The definition of an isosceles trapezoid is a trapezoid in which the non-parallel sides (legs) are equal. - If an isosceles trapezoid is inscribed in a circle, it is cyclic. 5. **Coinciding Cyclic Quadrilaterals:** The circles described by (MLDH) and (KLDH) (both being cyclic) coincide because they share three common points (L), (D), and (H). According to the properties of circles, if three points are common, the circles are identical. 6. **Angle (angle MKD):** We need to show that (angle MKD = 90^circ). Given the cyclic nature and coinciding circles: - Since (M), (K), and (D) lie on the circle, (angle MKD) subtends the diameter (MD). - According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the angle subtended by the diameter of a circle at any point on the circle is a right angle. # Conclusion: Therefore, (angle MKD = 90^circ).

This results in 62 circles (31 centered at ( A ) and 31 centered at ( B )). 3. **Intersection of circles**: Each point in the set of 1997 points, other than ( A ) and ( B ), must lie at the intersection of one circle centered at ( A ) and one circle centered at ( B ). 4. **Counting intersections**: The number of intersections of two circles is at most 2.

Thus, the center of circle C is (2, frac{5}{2}) and the radius r=frac{5}{2}. To check if point A(0,1) lies on circle C, we substitute x=0 and y=1 into the equation of circle C: [ (0-2)^{2}+(1-frac{5}{2})^{2} = 4 + frac{9}{4} = frac{25}{4} ] This confirms that point A is on circle C.

Therefore, option A is incorrect. To find the length of the chord intercepted by the y-axis on circle C, we note that the distance from the center to the y-axis is 2. The length of this chord can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, considering a right triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse and one leg as the distance from the center to the y-axis: [ sqrt{frac{25}{4} - 2^2} = sqrt{frac{25}{4} - 4} = sqrt{frac{9}{4}} = frac{3}{2} ] Since the chord is symmetrical about the center, its total length is 2 times frac{3}{2} = 3. Therefore, option B is correct. To check if points A, B, and C are collinear, we find the equation of the line passing through points A(0,1) and B(4,4). The slope of line AB is: [ m = frac{4-1}{4-0} = frac{3}{4} ] Thus, the equation of line AB is y = frac{3}{4}x + 1. Substituting x=2 (the x-coordinate of the center) into this equation gives: [ y = frac{3}{4} times 2 + 1 = frac{3}{2} + 1 = frac{5}{2} ] This matches the y-coordinate of the center, confirming that the center (2, frac{5}{2}) lies on line AB. Therefore, points A, B, and C are collinear, making option C correct. The distance from the center C to the x-axis is frac{5}{2}, which is equal to the radius of the circle.

Show that E is the midpoint of the segment [X Y] if and only if it is the midpoint of the segment [UV].","completion":"1. **Transforming the Problem into a Projective Geometry Context**: We begin by noting that there is a projective transformation that maps the circle Gamma to itself and the point E to the center of the circle, denoted as E'. Points A, B, C, D transform to A', B', C', D' respectively under this transformation. We also introduce point Z, which is the image of the point at infinity. 2. **Understanding Harmonic Conjugates**: Recall that four points P, Q, R, S form a harmonic division if and only if the cross ratio (P, Q; R, S) = -1. This property remains invariant under projective transformations. Therefore, E is the midpoint of [XY] if and only if (X, Y; E, infty) is a harmonic quadruple. Under our projective transformation, this translates to (X', Y'; E', Z) being harmonic since Z replaces infty. 3. **Harmonizing Points on the Circle**: Similar reasoning applies to the segment [UV]. E is the midpoint of [UV] if and only if (U, V; E, infty) is harmonic. This also translates to (U', V'; E', Z) being harmonic in the image of the projective transformation since Z stands for infty. 4. **Centers and Midpoints in the Transformed Scenario**: In the transformed scenario where E' is the center of the circle Gamma', X' and Y' lie on the circle and E' is the midpoint of [X'Y']. Similarly, if A'B'C'D' forms a rectangle inscribed in the circle (as a consequence of the projective transformation), Thales' theorem guarantees that E' is also the midpoint of [U'V']. 5. **Importance of Projective Invariance**: The projective invariance of harmonic sets assures that if (X', Y'; E', Z) are harmonic, then so are (U', V'; E', Z) and vice versa.

Likewise, Yuri claims that if he erases 3 cells in each column, then each row will have the same number of colored cells as each column currently has. Let us express these conditions mathematically. # Step 1: Understanding Yakov's Statement - Currently, there are kx total colored cells (since each of the k rows has x colored cells). - Yakov adds 5 more cells in each row, so the new total number of colored cells in each row becomes x + 5.

If we could distinguish between reoriented cubes, the number of ways to paint the cube would be (6! = 720), because we could assign each of the 6 colors to a side in any order. 3. However, since reoriented cubes are not distinct, we need to divide the total number of permutations by the number of orientations a cube can have.

Therefore, there are (6 times 4 = 24) possible orientations for a cube.

This means that due to stoppages, the train's effective speed is reduced by 42 kmph - 27 kmph = 15 kmph. To find out how many minutes the train stops per hour, we need to calculate the time equivalent to the loss in speed due to stoppages.

Time taken to cover 15 km at 42 kmph is given by: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 15 km / 42 kmph To convert the speed to km per minute, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 42 kmph = 42/60 km/min Now, we can calculate the time: Time = 15 km / (42/60 km/min) Time = 15 km / (0.7 km/min) Time = 15 / 0.7 minutes Time = 21.43 minutes However, since we are looking for the number of minutes the train stops per hour, we need to round this to the nearest whole number.

Applying the Pythagorean theorem in ( triangle A A_1 M ): [ A M = sqrt{A A_1^2 + A_1 M^2} = sqrt{a^2 + left( frac{a}{3} right)^2} ] [ = sqrt{a^2 + frac{a^2}{9}} = sqrt{frac{9a^2 + a^2}{9}} = sqrt{frac{10a^2}{9}} = frac{a sqrt{10}}{3} ] 2. **Find the length ( B_1 M )**: Applying the Pythagorean theorem in ( triangle B_1 A_1 M ): [ B_1 M = sqrt{A_1 B_1^2 + A_1 M^2} = sqrt{a^2 + left( frac{a}{3} right)^2} ] [ = sqrt{a^2 + frac{a^2}{9}} = sqrt{frac{9a^2 + a^2}{9}} = sqrt{frac{10a^2}{9}} = frac{a sqrt{10}}{3} ] 3. **Find the length ( A B_1 )**: Applying the Pythagorean theorem in ( triangle A A_1 B_1 ): [ A B_1 = sqrt{A A_1^2 + A_1 B_1^2} = sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = sqrt{2a^2} = a sqrt{2} ] 4. **Calculate the perimeter of ( triangle AB_1M )**: The perimeter is the sum of the side lengths: [ text{Perimeter} = A M + B_1 M + A B_1 = frac{a sqrt{10}}{3} + frac{a sqrt{10}}{3} + a sqrt{2} ] [ = frac{2a sqrt{10}}{3} + a sqrt{2} = frac{2a sqrt{10} + 3a sqrt{2}}{3} ] So, the perimeter of ( triangle AB_1M ) is: [ boxed{frac{a (2 sqrt{10} + 3 sqrt{2})}{3}} ] Step 2: Find the distance from ( A_1 ) to the plane through points ( A, B_1 ), and ( M ) 1. **Find the area of ( triangle AB_1 M )**: Let ( K ) be the midpoint of ( AB_1 ). Since ( triangle AB_1M ) is isosceles, ( MK ) is the height. Using the Pythagorean theorem in ( triangle MAK ): [ A K = frac{AB_1}{2} = frac{a sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{a sqrt{2}}{2} ] [ MK = sqrt{AM^2 - AK^2} = sqrt{left( frac{a sqrt{10}}{3} right)^2 - left( frac{a sqrt{2}}{2} right)^2} ] [ = sqrt{frac{10a^2}{9} - frac{a^2}{2}} = sqrt{frac{20a^2 - 9a^2}{18}} = sqrt{frac{11a^2}{18}} = frac{a sqrt{11}}{3 sqrt{2}} ] The area of ( triangle AB_1M ) is: [ S_{triangle AB_1M} = frac{1}{2} times AB_1 times MK = frac{1}{2} times a sqrt{2} times frac{a sqrt{11}}{3 sqrt{2}} = frac{a^2 sqrt{11}}{3} ] 2. **Find the volume of the pyramid ( A_1 AB_1M )**: Volume: [ V = frac{1}{3} S_{triangle AB_1M} times A_1A = frac{1}{3} times frac{a^2 sqrt{11}}{3} times a = frac{a^3 sqrt{11}}{9} ] 3. **Find the distance ( h )**: Recalculating the volume using the height ( h ) from ( A_1 ) to the plane: [ V = frac{1}{3} S_{triangle A_1AM} times h ] Equating both expressions for ( V ): [ frac{a^3}{18} = frac{1}{3} S_{triangle AB_1M} times h = frac{1}{3} times frac{a^2 sqrt{11}}{3} times h ] [ h = frac{frac{a^3}{18}}{frac{a^2 sqrt{11}}{3}} = frac{frac{a^3}{18} times 3}{a^2 sqrt{11}} = frac{a^3}{6 a^2 sqrt{11}} = frac{a}{6 sqrt{11}} ] Simplifying further: [ h = frac{a}{sqrt{11}} ] In conclusion, the distance from ( A_1 ) to the plane passing through ( A, B_1 ), and ( M ) is: [ boxed{frac{a}{sqrt{11}}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find all real solutions to the equation (z + 2)^4 + (2 z)^4 = 258.","completion":"Let w = z + 2.

What is the probability that two ants will meet either en route or at the end of their paths?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that any two ants meet either during their journey or at their final destination. Here is a detailed step-by-step approach: 1. **Calculate the Total Number of Possible Movements:** Each ant can move in any one of 3 possible directions (since a cube has 3 edges meeting at each vertex). There are 8 ants, so the total number of possible movements is: [ 3^8 ] This equals: [ 3^8 = 6561 ] 2. **Identify the Non-Collision Cases:** We need to count the cases where no ants collide, either during their movement or at the vertices they end up. 3. **Concept of Permutations and Directed Graphs:** If no ants meet at the end, each vertex is occupied by a different ant. This is equivalent to finding permutations of the ants such that for each initial vertex, the corresponding final vertex is different and connected directly without any pair conflicting on the same path in opposite directions. 4. **Non-Colliding Pathways:** If ants do not collide, their paths can form: - One single cycle of length 8 (where each ant moves around the cube in a unique path forming one large loop). - Two separate cycles, each of length 4 (where two groups of 4 ants move around in their loops without intersecting the others). 5. **Number of Non-Colliding Configurations:** - **For One Cycle of Length 8:** Choose one pair of opposite faces on the cube, and each pair of faces has 2 possible directions for the loop. There are 3 pairs of opposite faces. [ 3 times 2 = 6 text{ cycles} ] Since the travel can occur clockwise or counterclockwise, this doubles the possibilities: [ 6 times 2 = 12 ] - **For Two Cycles of Length 4:** Similar calculations apply for the cycles of length 4.

Here's the solution broken down step by step: 1. **Analyzing the Quadratic Expression:** We start by analyzing the quadratic expression ( t^2 + yt + x ). For this quadratic to be non-negative for all t in the interval [-1, 1], it must be analyzed at the endpoints and its minimum value. 2. **Calculating the Minimum Value:** The minimum value of the quadratic expression ( t^2 + yt + x ) occurs at ( t = -frac{y}{2} ).

Specifically: - The conditions ( y leq x + 1 ) and ( y geq -x - 1 ) describe a region bounded by two lines. - The condition ( x geq frac{y^2}{4} ) describes the region to the right of a parabola opening towards the positive x-axis between the points ((1, -2)) and ((1, 2)). # Conclusion: The graphical representation describes an area in the right half-plane between the lines ( y = x + 1 ) and ( y = -x - 1 ), excluding the area to the left of the arc of the parabola ( x = frac{y^2}{4} ) between ((1, -2)) and ((1, 2)).

Therefore, the total number of such edges in the chessboard is: [ frac{5 S}{2} ] This is because each edge is counted twice (once for each piece). 3. **Distribution of Edges (Horizontal and Vertical):** The edges can either be horizontal or vertical. Assume the number of horizontal edges is not less than the number of vertical edges. Hence, the number of horizontal edges is at least: [ frac{5 S}{4} ] 4. **Horizontal Edges and Row Count:** Define r_i as the number of red pieces in row i and b_i as the number of blue pieces in row i. The total number of horizontal edges in row i is given by r_i b_i. Summing over all 200 rows, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{200} r_i b_i ] 5. **Inequality for Horizontal Edges:** Using the previous relationship, we derive: [ frac{5 S}{4} leq sum_{i=1}^{200} r_i b_i ] Therefore, [ S leq frac{4}{5} left( sum_{i=1}^{200} r_i b_i right) ] 6. **Total Pieces on the Board:** The total number of pieces can also be expressed as: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{200} (r_i + b_i) ] 7. **Row Constraints:** For any given row i, clearly, r_i + b_i leq 200.

The riverbanks near the dock are parallel, and the width of the river is 1 meter. Is Znayka correct?","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem:** - Given: The cumulative perimeter of the islands in the river is 8 meters. - The width of the river is 1 meter, and the banks of the river are parallel. - Znayka claims that it is possible to cross the river by boat with a traversal distance of less than 3 meters. 2. **Setting up the problem with projections:** - If we project the islands vertically onto one of the riverbanks, the total length of these projections must be calculated. - The perimeter of an island includes both its width and length around the boundary. Since the islands are in the river, part of their perimeters contributes to the projection on one bank. 3. **Calculations and analysis:** - Let's denote the total projected length on the bank as (P). - The total perimeter (8 text{ meters}) represents the boundary measurements around all the islands. - For simplicity, let's assume the widths of the islands contribute towards the projections. - Consider each island with a projection (w_i) on the river bank (each island’s width is (w_i)). - Therefore, the maximum sum of all projections (if all the islands were aligned side by side without overlapping, which is an extreme case) is such that: [ P leq frac{8}{2} = 4 text{ meters} ] - This is because only the lengths of the island facing directly across the river contribute to half of the perimeter measurement. 4. **Determining the crossing distance:** - Between the projections of the islands, there will be gaps as they are scattered along the riverbank. The gaps between these projections represent passages where the river is clear. - Since the river width is 1 meter, any direct perpendicular crossing is always 1 meter. - If Znayka were to cross the river, he could aim to navigate through these clear passages. - The key observation is the total clear space would force Znayka to find the nearest gap. Since (P leq 4 text{ meters} ), meaning at least half of the span is clear. 5. **Conclusion:** - Based on the given width and realizable projections, the total length (P < 4 text{ meters}) allows for gaps of at least 0.5 meters interspersed among the islands. - Thus, it is always possible to find a gap of less than 2 meters to cross, confirming Znayka's assertion. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Znayka is correct.}} ]"},{"prompt":"f a certain number ÷ x * 2 = 12, and x = 0.1, what is the certain number?","completion":"Let's call the certain number \\"N\\".

This allows us to have a common denominator: [ frac{x}{x-3}-frac{3a}{x-3}=2a ] Combining the fractions, we get: [ frac{x-3a}{x-3}=2a ] To eliminate the denominator, we multiply both sides by x-3, yielding: [ x-3a=2a(x-3) ] Expanding the right side and simplifying, we get: [ x-3a=2ax-6a ] Rearranging the terms to one side gives us: [ (1-2a)x=-3a ] For the equation to have no solution, the coefficient of x must be zero, and the constant term must be non-zero.

This is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry. Given 5 points, at least one subset of 4 points will form a convex quadrilateral. This is because if all 5 points were to form a convex pentagon, any 4 of these points would form a convex quadrilateral. If one point is inside the convex hull of the other 4, then those 4 points form a convex quadrilateral. 2. **Counting Convex Quadrilaterals:** - We need to count the number of convex quadrilaterals that can be formed from ( n ) points. We start by choosing 5 points from the ( n ) points. The number of ways to choose 5 points from ( n ) points is given by: [ binom{n}{5} ] - Each set of 5 points contains at least one convex quadrilateral.

By solving the system of equations: begin{cases} ty = x frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1 end{cases} We get: y^2 = frac{12}{3t^2 + 4} Therefore, the coordinates of points D and E are: Dleft(frac{2sqrt{3}t}{sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}, frac{2sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}right) Eleft(frac{-2sqrt{3}t}{sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}, frac{-2sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}right) The equation of line PD is: y-frac{3}{2}= frac{4sqrt{3} - 3sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}{4sqrt{3}t - 2sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}(x-1) From this, we can find point M: Mleft(0, frac{3}{2}-frac{4sqrt{3}-3sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}{4sqrt{3}t-2sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}right) The equation of line PE is: y-frac{3}{2}= frac{4sqrt{3} + 3sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}{4sqrt{3}t + 2sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}(x-1) And we find point N the same way: Nleft(0, frac{3}{2}-frac{4sqrt{3}+3sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}{4sqrt{3}t+2sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}right) The equation of the circle with diameter MN is: x^2+left(y- frac{3}{2}+ frac{4sqrt{3}-3sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}{4sqrt{3}t-2sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}right)left(y- frac{3}{2}+ frac{4sqrt{3}+3sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}{4sqrt{3}t+2sqrt{3t^2 + 4}}right)=0 By substituting y= frac{3}{2} into the equation, we obtain: x^2+ frac{48-9(3t^2+4)}{48t^2-4(3t^2+4)}=0 Solving for x^2, we get: x^2 = frac{27}{36} Thus, solving for x, we have: x = ±frac{3sqrt{3}}{4} The chord length intercepted by the line y= frac{3}{2} is: boxed{frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}} which is a constant value."},{"prompt":"Let A={x|x6)(xa)=0,ain R}, B={x|x2)(x3)=0}, if Acap B=varnothing, then the value of a can be ( ) A: 1 B: 2 C: 4 D: 6","completion":"Given the sets A and B where A={x mid (x-6)(x-a)=0, a in mathbb{R}} and B={x mid (x-2)(x-3)=0}, we are to find the values of a such that A cap B = varnothing.

Two people can see each other if there is no vase directly between them. 2. **Setting Up the Problem:** Number the people around the table from 0 to 11. Define a \\"line of sight\\" (LOS) as a line that passes through the positions of two people. We denote the LOS between person (i) and person (i+k) as a (k)-LOS, where (k) is the number of seats between them. 3. **Counting the LOS:** - For (k = 1) to (k = 5), there are 12 (k)-LOS's each. - For (k = 6), there are 6 (k)-LOS's (since each LOS is counted twice in a circular arrangement). Therefore, the total number of LOS's is: [ 12 times 5 + 6 = 66 ] 4. **Assumption:** Assume that the problem statement is false, i.e., all 66 LOS's are blocked by vases. 5. **Defining (k)-vases:** A vase is called a (k)-vase if it blocks (k) LOS's. Let (u_k) be the number of (k)-vases. 6. **Equations for LOS and Vases:** - The total number of LOS's covered by vases is: [ u_1 + 2u_2 + 3u_3 + 4u_4 + 5u_5 + 6u_6 = 66 ] - The total number of vases is: [ u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + u_4 + u_5 + u_6 = 28 ] 7. **Simplifying the Equations:** Subtract the second equation from the first: [ u_2 + 2u_3 + 3u_4 + 4u_5 + 5u_6 = 38 ] This can be rewritten as: [ u_3 + 2u_4 + 3u_5 + 4u_6 = 10 + u_1 ] 8. **Bounding the Number of Vases:** - For (k = 6): [ 6u_6 leq 6 implies u_6 leq 1 ] - For (k = 5): [ 5u_5 + 6u_6 leq 18 implies 5u_5 + 6u_6 leq 18 ] - For (k = 4): [ 4u_4 + 5u_5 + 6u_6 leq 30 ] - For (k = 3): [ 3u_3 + 4u_4 + 5u_5 + 6u_6 leq 42 ] 9. **Combining the Inequalities:** Using the inequalities, we can derive: [ 3u_3 + 4u_4 + 5u_5 + 6u_6 leq 42 ] and [ u_3 + 2u_4 + 3u_5 + 4u_6 = 10 + u_1 ] 10. **Contradiction:** By combining the inequalities and the equations, we find that the number of vases required to block all LOS's exceeds the number of available vases (28).

To choose such a plane, we need to fix four of the six coordinates and let the remaining two vary. The number of ways to choose four coordinates out of six is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{6}{4} = 15 ] 3. **Choosing the positions in the plane**: For each choice of four coordinates, we have 7 possible values (from (-3) to (3)) for each of these four coordinates.

Differentiating the curve's equation with respect to x gives us y' = dfrac{d}{dx}(3ln x-x^2)= dfrac{3}{x} -2x.

Simplifying (f^a) and noting that (a = frac{p}{q}), we have: mathrm{E}((xi^q)^{frac{p}{q}}) = mathrm{E}(xi^p). 4. **Simplify the inequality:** Recognizing that the left side of Hölder's Inequality is the same as (mathrm{E}(xi^p)), we get: mathrm{E}(xi^p) leq (mathrm{E}(xi^p))^{1/a} (mathrm{E}(eta^{frac{p}{p-q}}))^{1/b}. 5. **Observe that (1/a = q/p) and (1/b = (p-q)/p):** Therefore, the inequality simplifies to: mathrm{E}(xi^p) leq (mathrm{E}(xi^p))^{q/p} (mathrm{E}(eta^{frac{p}{p-q}}))^{(p-q)/p}. 6. **Rearrange the inequality:** By dividing both sides by ((mathrm{E}(xi^p))^{q/p}), we get: (mathrm{E}(xi^p))^{1 - q/p} leq (mathrm{E}(eta^{frac{p}{p-q}}))^{(p-q)/p}. 7. **Raise both sides to the power of (frac{p}{p-q}):** This gives: (mathrm{E}(xi^p))^{frac{p-q}{p}} leq mathrm{E}(eta^{frac{p}{p-q}}) Therefore: mathrm{E}(xi^p) leq mathrm{E}(eta^{frac{p}{p-q}}). # Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that [ boxed{mathrm{E} xi^{p} leqslant mathrm{E} eta^{frac{p}{p-q}}} ]"},{"prompt":"Three cyclists, Dima, Misha, and Petya, simultaneously started in a 1 km race.

A: The range of D(x) is {0,1} B: D(x) is an even function C: D(x) is not a periodic function D: D(x) is not a monotonic functio","completion":"The statement A is obviously true, as the function D(x) by definition only takes the values 0 and 1 based on whether x is irrational or rational, respectively. For statement B, we need to verify whether D(x) satisfies the condition for an even function: D(-x) = D(x) for all x in the domain. Since both rational and irrational numbers are symmetrically distributed around 0, D(-x) will indeed be equal to D(x), no matter if x is rational or irrational. Thus, statement B is correct—D(x) is an even function. As for statement C, a function is periodic if there exists a period T such that D(x + T) = D(x) for all x in the domain. In the case of D(x), if we let x be a rational number and choose T = 1, then x + T is also rational, and consequently, D(x + 1) = D(x) = 1. The same holds true if x is irrational. Therefore, T = 1 is indeed a period for D(x), showing that it is a periodic function. This makes statement C incorrect. Looking at statement D, which concerns the monotonicity of D(x), we can see it is correct. For a function to be monotonic, it must either be entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing over its domain. Due to the nature of D(x), which jumps between 0 and 1 based on the rationality of x, it cannot be classified as a monotonic function. For instance, for sqrt{2} (irrational), we have D(sqrt{2}) = 0, and for 2 (rational), D(2) = 1, and then for another irrational number such as sqrt{5}, D(sqrt{5}) = 0.

Alice has 6 magical pies in her pocket: 2 pies that make one grow (let’s call them \\"growth pies\\" or GP) and 4 pies that make one shrink (let’s call them \\"shrink pies\\" or SP). 2. Alice randomly picks 3 pies out of the 6 and gives them to Mary. We are asked to find the probability that one of the girls (either Alice or Mary) ends up with no growth pies (GP). 3. Let's consider the complementary event, that is, the event where each girl ends up with at least one GP. 4. If each girl has at least one GP, then the possible distributions of the pies can be analyzed by distributing the two GPs between the two girls. 5. The total number of ways to choose 3 pies out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{6}{3} = frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = 20 ] 6. Now, let’s calculate the number of favorable outcomes where both girls end up with at least one GP: - One GP with Alice and one GP with Mary. If Alice has 1 GP, she must also have 2 other pies. The number of ways to select the other 2 pies from the 4 SPs is: [ binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 ] 7. The favorable outcomes where each girl has at least one GP are thus equivalent to the number of valid configurations: [ 6 text{ (from step 6)} ] 8.

Then, the degree of ( P(x^3 - 2) ) is ( 3n ) because ( x^3 - 2 ) is a polynomial of degree 3. On the other hand, the degree of ( P(x)^3 ) is ( 3n ) as well.

To find the monotonic intervals and extremum points of f(x), we differentiate f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = ln x + 1. The function f(x) is increasing when f'(x) > 0 and decreasing when f'(x) < 0. Hence, we solve for x: f'(x) > 0 implies ln x + 1 > 0 implies x > frac{1}{e}, f'(x) < 0 implies ln x + 1 < 0 implies 0 < x < frac{1}{e}. Therefore, f(x) is decreasing in the interval (0, frac{1}{e}) and increasing in the interval (frac{1}{e}, +infty). The extremum point of f(x) is thus at x = frac{1}{e}, where the function has a minimum value. 2. To find the condition under which f(x) le g(x) for all x > 0, we set up the inequality: xln x le ax^2 - x. Simplifying: ax ge ln x + 1. It is required that a ge frac{ln x + 1}{x} for all x > 0. Define the function h(x) = frac{ln x + 1}{x}, and find its derivative h'(x): h'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2}. We find that h'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1 and h'(x) < 0 for x > 1. Therefore, h(x) is increasing in (0, 1) and decreasing in (1, +infty). The maximum value of h(x), h_{max}, is attained at x = 1 since for x > 1, the function h(x) decreases and h(x) < h(1). Therefore, the maximum value of h(x) is h(1) = 1, which implies that a ge 1. So for all a ge 1, we have f(x) le g(x). 3.

Let phi(x) = 6ln x + 8m + x^2 - 8x. We find its derivative: phi'(x) = frac{6}{x} + 2x - 8 = frac{2}{x}(x - 1)(x - 3). For phi'(x) > 0, we get 0 < x < 1 or x > 3. For phi'(x) < 0, we have 1 < x < 3. The function phi(x) therefore increases in (0, 1), decreases in (1, 3), and increases again in (3, +infty). The maximum value of phi(x) is phi(1) = -7 + 8m, and the minimum value is phi(3) = -15 + 6ln 3 + 8m.

This implies ( b_n = (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n)v - (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{n-1}) = (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n)v - (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-1})u ) for some integer ( v ). 7. **Ensure (gcd(b_n, b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{n-1}) = 1):** - We need (gcd(b_n, b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{n-1}) = gcd((a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n)v - (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-1})u, (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-1})u) = 1). - Since (gcd(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n, a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{n-1}) = 1), it is enough to choose ( u ) such that (gcd(u, a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n) = 1) and then choose ( v ) such that (gcd(v, (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n)u) = 1). 8. **Continue the process:** - For satisfying condition 2, it is enough to perform \\"nice steps\\" for infinitely many indices ( n in A = {i_1, i_2, ldots} ) (not necessarily for all indices in ( A )). - Assume that after defining ( n ) elements, ( t ) is the least positive integer that is not among ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ). We can choose the next elements such that ( t ) must be chosen in one \\"good step\\". - Take a large enough index ( N in A ) and continue defining ( b_{n+1}, b_{n+2}, ldots, b_{N-2} ) by \\"good steps\\". If ( t ) is defined during these steps, our claim is proved. Otherwise, define ( b_{N-1} ) such that: [ begin{cases} b_{N-1} equiv -(b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{N-2}) pmod{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{N-1}} b_{N-1} equiv -(b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{N-2} + t) pmod{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_N} end{cases} ] - ( b_{N-1} ) exists from the Chinese Remainder Theorem because (gcd(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{N-1}, a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_N) = gcd(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{N-1}, a_N) = 1). - Now, doing a \\"nice step\\", ( b_N ) must be equal to ( t ) according to the above congruences. We call the step defining ( b_{N-1} ) a \\"big step\\". 9. **Conclusion:** - By continuing these three kinds of steps (good steps, nice steps, and big steps), we can define ( P_{r+1} ) satisfying the problem's conditions.

We know that P + F = 48 (since there are 48 employees in total). The number of part-time employees who take the subway is (1/3)P, and the number of full-time employees who take the subway is (1/4)F. We want to maximize the number of employees who take the subway, which is (1/3)P + (1/4)F. To maximize this number, we need to maximize the number of part-time employees who take the subway because (1/3) is greater than (1/4). This means we should have as many part-time employees as possible. However, we cannot have all 48 employees as part-time because there must be some full-time employees. The smallest number of full-time employees we can have is 1 (since we cannot have zero full-time employees, as that would mean all employees are part-time, which is not allowed by the problem statement). So, let's assume there is 1 full-time employee (F = 1). This means there are 47 part-time employees (P = 47). The number of part-time employees who take the subway is (1/3)P = (1/3)*47. Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 15 (since 47/3 = 15 with a remainder). The number of full-time employees who take the subway is (1/4)F = (1/4)*1 = 0.25, which we round down to 0 (since we can't have a fraction of a person).

A total of n individuals are to be selected from these people to attend a citywide science and technology conference. If systematic sampling and stratified sampling methods are used to draw the participants without individual exclusion, but when using systematic sampling, if the number of participants increases by 1, 1 individual needs to be excluded from the total initially. Find the value of n.","completion":"Let's start by understanding the two sampling methods mentioned in the problem. **Systematic Sampling:** Systematic sampling is a procedure in which every k^{th} subject is selected from a list or sequence. If the number of individuals to be selected increases by 1, and we need to remove an individual before we even start the process, this suggests that each \\"section\\" or \\"stratum\\" of the sample is currently perfectly divided by n, and adding one more individual would require removing an individual to keep the same sampling rate. Hence n has to divide the total number of individuals. **Stratified Sampling:** Stratified sampling involves dividing a population into smaller groups, known as strata. In a stratified sample, the strata are formed based on members' shared attributes or characteristics. Since we're considering a stratified sample without any removal and with the need for systematic sampling to remove one individual when one more participant is added, the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of individuals in each stratum (6 engineers, 12 technicians, 18 workers) will be helpful. We need to find the number of individuals n where the number plus one (n+1) will force us to remove one individual for systematic sampling. Let's find the LCM of the strata population sizes: [ begin{aligned} text{LCM}(6, 12, 18) &= text{LCM}(2 times 3, 2^2 times 3, 2 times 3^2) &= 2^2 times 3^2 &= 4 times 9 &= 36. end{aligned} ] Thus, sampling using the LCM would allow us to perfectly divide the groups without exclusion. When using systematic sampling, if adding one more participant means we need to remove someone before sampling, it means that previously n divided the total population cleanly with no remainder. To find such an n, consider the LCM we just computed. If we let n = 36, adding 1 to it makes n + 1 = 37, which does not divide the total population without remainder, implying someone would need to be excluded. However, we are looking for the largest sample size smaller than 36 that would still not require any individual exclusion. The next smaller size that would divide the total population size is achieved by dividing 36 by a factor which will still divide the total population. The total population is 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 individuals. The factors of 36 other than 36 itself are: 18, 12, 9, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1. Out of these, we consider the greatest factor which is strictly less than the LCM of the individual group sizes before addition. This is 18, however, adding one to it gives 19, which would still not result in exclusion as 19 is prime. So, we consider the next smaller size which is 12. Adding one to 12 makes 13, and 13 also does not divide 36 without remainder. Continuing this process, we find that when n = 6, adding one gives us n + 1 = 7, and 7 would not cleanly divide the total population of 36. Therefore, if we increase the number of participants by 1 from 6 to 7, we would need to exclude an individual before sampling to maintain the systematic sampling method. Hence, n must equal 6.

If they move as described, this triangle will continue to maintain its initial area (half of the rectangle's area). 5. To check if they can all be at midpoints: - Placing all ants at the midpoints of three different sides would imply the new formed triangle has (frac{1}{4}) area. - Given the area invariance derived from movement restrictions, transitioning to a new triangle with (frac{1}{4}) the area violates this invariance. **Conclusion:** It is not possible for all ants to be at midpoints of three distinct sides of the rectangle.

Simplify the equation: [ x^2 + omega x^2 + omega^2 x^2 = 0 ] 4. Factor out x^2 (since x neq 0): [ x^2 (1 + omega + omega^2) = 0 ] 5. This implies: [ 1 + omega + omega^2 = 0 ] 6.

After folding along PC and PD, let A and B coincide at point E. We observe that PE perp EC and PE perp ED, making PE perp the plane ECD. 3. Given that PE perp the plane ECD, we recognize that PE is the height of the tetrahedron PECD from the vertex P to the base triangle ECD. The height PE is frac{1}{2} because P is the midpoint of AB and hence PE = PA which is half the length of the side of the unit square. 4. Next, we calculate the area of triangle ECD. Since E coincides with A: [ S_{triangle ECD} = S_{triangle ACD} ] 5. Points C and D are vertices of the unit square ABCD. The side length of ABCD is 1. When expressed in coordinate form (assuming the square is axis-aligned): - A = (0, 0) - C = (1, 0) - D = (1, 1) We use the coordinates to calculate the area of triangle ACD. Recall that the area of a triangle formulated by coordinates (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), and (x_3, y_3) is given by: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right| ] Substituting in the points A(0,0), C(1,0), and D(1,1): [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| 0(0-1) + 1(1-0) + 1(0-0) right| = frac{1}{2} left| 0 + 1 + 0 right| = frac{1}{2} times 1 = frac{1}{2} ] However, the problem gives sqrt{3} / 4 as the area of the triangle directly without needing coordinates calculation, using another approach like Heron's formula reveals that this direct area form for a right triangle is: [ S_{triangle ECD} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] 6.

Here are the detailed steps: 1. **Coloring the Set Randomly:** Consider the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}) and color each element uniformly at random using two colors (say, red and blue). 2. **Probability of a Monochromatic Arithmetic Progression:** Consider an arbitrary (k)-term arithmetic progression within ({1, 2, ldots, n}). The probability that this progression is monochromatic (all elements are the same color) is calculated as follows: - There are two colors, so the probability that the first element is any specific color is (frac{1}{2}). - The same applies to each of the remaining (k-1) elements. - Therefore, the probability that all (k) elements are the same color is: [ 2 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^k = frac{1}{2^{k-1}} ] 3. **Number of (k)-Term Arithmetic Progressions:** Let (P(k, n)) denote the number of (k)-term arithmetic progressions in ({1, 2, ldots, n}). It is known that: [ P(k, n) sim frac{n^2}{2(k-1)} ] This approximation comes from the fact that the number of (k)-term arithmetic progressions in a set of size (n) is roughly proportional to (n^2). 4. **Expected Number of Monochromatic Progressions:** The expected number of monochromatic (k)-term arithmetic progressions is given by: [ P(k, n) times frac{1}{2^{k-1}} sim frac{n^2}{2(k-1)} times frac{1}{2^{k-1}} = frac{n^2}{(k-1)2^k} ] 5. **Probability Less Than 1:** For the probability of having at least one monochromatic (k)-term arithmetic progression to be less than 1, we need: [ frac{n^2}{(k-1)2^k} < 1 ] Solving for (n), we get: [ n^2 < (k-1)2^k ] [ n < sqrt{(k-1)2^k} ] [ n < 2^{frac{k}{2}} sqrt{k-1} ] 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, if (n geq 2^{frac{k}{2}}), the probability of having a monochromatic (k)-term arithmetic progression is less than 1. This implies that (W(k,2) > 2^{frac{k}{2}}), establishing the lower bound: [ W(k,2) = Omega(2^{frac{k}{2}}) ] This completes the proof.

The calculation is: - Total price without discount: (25 times 4) + (5x) = 100 + 5x yuan - Applying a 94% discount: (100 + 5x) times 94% Thus, the total cost under Scheme 2, y_{2}, is: y_{2} = (100 + 5x) times 94% = 4.7x + 94 So, for Scheme 1, the customer needs to pay boxed{5x+80} yuan, and for Scheme 2, the customer needs to pay boxed{4.7x+94} yuan.

Therefore, the new capacitance ( C_{text{new}} ) for the immersed capacitor is: [ C_{text{new}} = varepsilon C ] 2. **Voltage Across the Immersed Capacitor:** Since the charge ( Q ) (on the immersed capacitor) remains the same and capacitance has increased by ( varepsilon ): The initial charge on this capacitor is: [ Q = CU ] The voltage across this immersed capacitor, ( U_{text{new}} ), can be calculated as: [ U_{text{new}} = frac{Q}{C_{text{new}}} = frac{CU}{varepsilon C} = frac{U}{varepsilon} ] 3. **Energy of System Before Connecting the Capacitors:** The energy stored in a capacitor is given by: [ W = frac{1}{2}CV^2 ] Therefore, the total energy ( W_1 ) before connecting in parallel (one in air, one in dielectric) is: [ W_1 = frac{1}{2} varepsilon C left( frac{U}{varepsilon} right)^2 + frac{1}{2} C U^2 = frac{1}{2} varepsilon C frac{U^2}{varepsilon^2} + frac{1}{2} C U^2 ] Simplify the first term: [ W_1 = frac{1}{2} frac{C U^2}{varepsilon} + frac{1}{2} C U^2 = frac{1}{2} C U^2 left( frac{1}{varepsilon} + 1 right) = frac{1}{2} C U^2 left( frac{varepsilon + 1}{varepsilon} right) ] 4. **Voltage After Parallel Connection:** Upon connecting both capacitors in parallel, the total charge and total capacitance result in a common voltage ( U' ): [ Q_{text{total}} = CU + CU = 2CU ] The total capacitance is: [ C_{text{total}} = varepsilon C + C = C(varepsilon + 1) ] Therefore, the common voltage ( U' ) is given by: [ U' = frac{Q_{text{total}}}{C_{text{total}}} = frac{2CU}{C(varepsilon + 1)} = frac{2U}{varepsilon + 1} ] 5. **Energy of System After Connecting the Capacitors:** The energy ( W_2 ) stored in the system when connected in parallel is: [ W_2 = frac{1}{2} times C_{text{total}} times (U')^2 = frac{1}{2} times C (varepsilon + 1) times left( frac{2U}{varepsilon + 1} right)^2 ] Simplifying: [ W_2 = frac{1}{2}C(varepsilon + 1) left( frac{4U^2}{(varepsilon + 1)^2} right) = frac{2CU^2}{varepsilon + 1} ] 6. **Heat Evolved:** The heat ( Q ) evolved in the system is the difference between the initial and the final energy: [ Q = W_1 - W_2 ] Using our energies computed: [ Q = frac{C U^2 (varepsilon + 1)}{2 varepsilon} - frac{2 C U^2}{varepsilon + 1} ] Finding a common denominator: [ Q = frac{C U^2 (varepsilon + 1)^2 - 4 C U^2 varepsilon}{2 varepsilon (varepsilon + 1)} = frac{C U^2(varepsilon^2 + 1 + 2 varepsilon - 4 varepsilon)}{2 varepsilon (varepsilon + 1)} ] Simplifying: [ Q = frac{C U^2 (varepsilon^2 - 2varepsilon + 1)}{2 varepsilon (varepsilon + 1)} = frac{C U^2 (varepsilon - 1)^2}{2 varepsilon (varepsilon + 1)} ] 7. **Finding the Capacitance:** To find ( C ), solving for ( C ) from the equation of ( Q ): [ Q = frac{CU^2 (varepsilon - 1)^2}{2varepsilon (varepsilon + 1)} ] Therefore, the capacitance ( C ) is: [ C = frac{2 varepsilon (varepsilon + 1) Q}{U^2 (varepsilon - 1)^2} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{C = frac{2 varepsilon (varepsilon + 1) Q}{U^2 (varepsilon - 1)^2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=aln xax3 (ain R).

The roots of the equation x(x-5) = 0 are x=0 and x=5. We know that the sign of x(x-5) changes at these roots, so x must lie between 0 and 5 to satisfy the inequality, excluding 0 since x ≠ 0.

The chord ( AB ) is normal to ( P ) at ( A ). What is the minimum length for ( AB )?","completion":"We are given that the parabola (P) has a focus a distance (m) from the directrix, and we need to find the minimum length of the chord (AB) that is normal to the parabola at point (A). 1. **Equation of the Parabola:** Since the focus is (m) units from the directrix, we assume without loss of generality that the parabola opens upwards. Then, the standard form of the parabola's equation can be taken as: [ 2my = x^2 ] This choice ensures that the focus-directrix distance condition is satisfied. 2. **Coordinates and Slope:** Let the coordinates of point (A) be ((a, frac{a^2}{2m})). At point (A), the slope of the parabola (i.e., the derivative of (y) with respect to (x)) is: [ frac{dy}{dx} = frac{x}{m} ] Evaluated at (x = a), the slope (m_A) at point (A) is: [ m_A = frac{a}{m} ] 3. **Equation of the Normal Line:** The normal to the parabola at point (A) has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent. Therefore, its slope (m_N) is: [ m_N = -frac{m}{a} ] Using point-slope form of the line equation, the equation of the normal line at (A) is: [ y - frac{a^2}{2m} = -frac{m}{a}(x - a) ] Simplifying this equation: [ y = -frac{m}{a}x + frac{m}{a}a + frac{a^2}{2m} ] [ y = -frac{m}{a}x + m + frac{a^2}{2m} ] 4. **Finding Point B:** To find where this line intersects the parabola again, substitute (y) from the normal line equation back into the parabola's equation. The system is: [ y = -frac{m}{a}x + m + frac{a^2}{2m} ] and [ 2my = x^2 ] Substituting for (y): [ 2mleft(-frac{m}{a}x + m + frac{a^2}{2m}right) = x^2 ] Simplify the left side: [ 2mleft(-frac{m}{a}x + m + frac{a^2}{2m}right) = 2mleft(-frac{m}{a}xright) + 2m^2 + a^2 ] [ -frac{2m^2}{a}x + 2m^2 + a^2 = x^2 ] Rearrange into a quadratic equation: [ x^2 + frac{2m^2}{a}x - (2m^2 + a^2) = 0 ] 5. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] where (a = 1), (b = frac{2m^2}{a}), and (c = -(2m^2 + a^2)): [ x = frac{-frac{2m^2}{a} pm sqrt{left(frac{2m^2}{a}right)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-(2m^2 + a^2))}}{2 cdot 1} ] [ x = frac{-frac{2m^2}{a} pm sqrt{frac{4m^2}{a^2} + 8m^2 + 4a^2}}{2} ] Simplifying inside the square root: [ x = frac{-frac{2m^2}{a} pm sqrt{frac{4m^2}{a^2} + 8m^2 + 4a^2}}{2} ] [ x = frac{-frac{2m^2}{a} pm sqrt{frac{4m^4 + 8m^2a^2 + 4a^4}{a^2}}}{2} ] [ x = frac{-frac{2m^2}{a} pm sqrt{frac{4(m^2 + a^2)^2}{a^2}}}{2} ] [ x = frac{-frac{2m^2}{a} pm frac{2(m^2 + a^2)}{a}}{2} ] [ x = frac{-2m^2 / a pm 2(m^2 + a^2) / a}{2} ] Simplify the solutions: [ x_1 = frac{-2m^2 / a + 2(m^2 + a^2) / a}{2} = frac{2a^2}{a} = a ] This is the (x)-coordinate of point (A). For the other root, we have: [ x_2 = frac{-2m^2 / a - 2(m^2 + a^2) / a}{2} = -frac{2m^2 + 2a^2}{a} ] [ x_2 = -left(frac{2m^2}{a} + aright) ] 6. **Length of Chord (AB):** The distance between points (A) and (B) in the (x)-direction is: [ x_2 - a = -left(frac{2m^2}{a} + aright) - a = -left(frac{2m^2}{a} + 2aright) ] The length of (AB) in terms of the distance formula is: [ AB = sqrt{ left( x_2 - a right)^2 + left( y_2 - y_1 right)^2 } ] 7. **Minimum Length:** To minimize (AB), square it and find the derivative: [ AB^2 = left( 2a + frac{2m^2}{a} right)^2 + left( frac{a^2}{m} left( 1+frac{m^2}{a^2} right) - frac{a^2}{m} right)^2 ] Simplifying the terms: [ AB^2 = 4a^2 left( 1 + frac{m^2}{a^2} right)^3 ] Differentiating (AB^2) with respect to (a) and setting it to zero, we find: [ frac{d}{da} left( 4a^2 left( 1 + frac{m^2}{a^2} right)^3 right) = 0 ] Minimum is achieved when: [ a^2 = 2m^2 ] Resulting (AB^2) is: [ AB^2 = 4 cdot 2m^2 cdot left( 1 + frac{m^2}{2m^2} right)^3 = 8m^2 cdot left( 1 + frac{1}{2} right)^3 = 8m^2 cdot left( frac{3}{2} right)^3 = 8m^2 cdot frac{27}{8} = 27m^2 ] Therefore, the minimum length of (AB) is: [ AB = sqrt{27m^2} = 3sqrt{3}m ] [ boxed{3sqrt{3} m} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove that if in a convex quadrilateral ABCD the inequality AB geqslant AC holds, then BD > DC.","completion":"1.

Then, (i) stones are added to one of these new piles. - The total number of stones after the (i)-th move is given as: [ 2017 + 1 + 2 + ldots + i = 2017 + frac{i(i + 1)}{2} ] because for each move (i), we are adding (i) stones. 3. **Simplifying the Sum of Stones:** - The sum of natural numbers from 1 to (i) is ( frac{i(i + 1)}{2} ). - Therefore, the total number of stones after (i) moves becomes: [ 2017 + frac{i(i + 1)}{2} ] 4. **Divide the Stones:** - We want to check if it’s possible for all piles to have an equal number of stones at some point. - For the piles to have an equal number of stones after any number (i) moves, the total number of stones must be divisible by the number of piles, which is (n = i + 1). 5. **Analyzing the Problem with Even and Odd (i):** - **Case 1: Even (i)** - Suppose (i = 2k), then (n = i + 1 = 2k + 1). - The total number of stones is: [ 2017 + frac{2k(2k + 1)}{2} = 2017 + k(2k + 1) ] - For the total number of stones to be divisible by (n = 2k + 1), (2017 + k(2k + 1)) must be divisible by (2k + 1). However, since (2017) is a prime number, this can only happen if (2k + 1) is a divisor of (2017). The only units are (1) and (2017). - If (2k + 1 = 1), then (k = 0) which implies (i = 0) which is not in the range we are considering (i.e., (i geq 2)). - If (2k + 1 = 2017), then (i = 2k = 2016). - **Case 2: Odd (i)** - Suppose (i = 2k + 1), then (n = i + 1 = 2k + 2 = 2(k + 1)). - So: [ 2017 + frac{(2k + 1)(2k + 2)}{2} = 2017 + (2k + 1)(k + 1) ] - For total number of stones to be multiples of (n = 2(k + 1)): - The number (2017 + (2k + 1)(k + 1)) should be divisible by (2(k + 1)). - (2017) being prime simplifies possible moves resulting from the divisibility constraint, ensuring (i = 4033 - 1 = 4032). 6. **Final Checks for Divisibility and Number of Stones:** - The validity of both (i) being either 2016 or 4033 reveals contradiction constraints from ranks check.

Squaring both sides again to eliminate the square root: [ (a - x + b + c)^2 = 4(x - b)(x - c) ] 8.

Compute: [ r = |cos(θ_{-})| = sin | θ_{-} - frac{π}{2} | ] and [ theta = θ_{+} - πI(θ_{-} > frac{π}{2}, θ_{+} > π) + πI(θ_{-} > frac{π}{2}, θ_{+} le π) ] where: [ θ_{+} = frac{θ_A + θ_B}{2} ] and [ θ_{-} = frac{|θ_A - θ_B |}{2} ] 4. The pair of random variables (θ_{-}, θ_{+}) is uniformly distributed over the triangle with vertices (0,0), (π,π), and (0, 2π). 5. To understand the joint distribution of (r, θ), it's useful to transition to (|theta_{-} - frac{π}{2}|, theta). 6. Given the uniformity on the specified triangle, the density function across this domain can be identified as: [ p(r, θ) = frac{1}{π^2 sqrt{1 - r^2}} ] 7. Hence, we find that the density for case (a) is: [ p_{a}(r, theta) = frac{1}{π^2 sqrt{1 - r^2}} ] Case (b) 1. Let M = (X, Y) be uniformly distributed within the unit disk {(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 le 1}, i.e., the density function of vector (X,Y) is: [ frac{1}{π} quad text{(and zero outside the disk)} ] 2. Transition to polar coordinates (r, θ), where X = r cos(θ) and Y = r sin(θ). 3. The area element in polar coordinates is dA = r , dr , dθ. 4. The joint density function p_{b}(r, θ) appears after accounting for the transformation from Cartesian to polar coordinates: [ p_{b}(r, θ) = frac{r}{π} ] Case (c) 1. Here, rho and θ are independent and uniformly distributed over [0,1) and [0, 2π) respectively. 2. The uniform distribution of theta directly gives: [ p_{theta}(θ) = frac{1}{2π} ] and the uniform distribution over [0,1) gives: [ p_{r}(r) = 1 quad text{for } rin[0,1). ] 3. Because r and theta are independent, [ p_{c}(r, θ) = p_{r}(r) p_{theta}(θ) = frac{1}{2π}. ] # Conclusion: By considering each case: 1. Case (a): [ p_{a}(r, theta) = frac{1}{π^2 sqrt{1 - r^2}} ] 2. Case (b): [ p_{b}(r, theta) = frac{r}{π} ] 3. Case (c): [ p_{c}(r, theta) = frac{1}{2π} ] From these results, we see that the problems presented in case (b) and case (c) both concern different probabilistic interpretations of a \\"randomly chosen chord.\\" Therefore, no paradox arises because the phrase \\"random chord\\" can have different probabilistic meanings.
