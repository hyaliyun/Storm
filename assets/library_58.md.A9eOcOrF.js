Some islanders said that there is an even number of knights on the island, while the remaining islanders said that there is an odd number of liars on the island. Can there be exactly 2021 residents on the island?","completion":"1. Let's analyze the question by introducing some variables. Let ( K ) represent the number of knights on the island, and ( L ) represent the number of liars. The total number of inhabitants on the island, ( N ), is the sum of knights and liars, so ( N = K + L ). 2. According to the problem, there are two types of inhabitants: knights who always tell the truth and liars who always lie. This means that every statement made by a knight is true, and every statement made by a liar is false. 3. Some inhabitants claimed that there is an even number of knights, while the others claimed there is an odd number of liars. We'll analyze these claims. - If a knight claims there is an even number of knights, the statement must be true because knights always tell the truth. Thus, ( K ) must be even. - If a liar claims there is an odd number of liars, the statement must be false because liars always lie. Therefore, the actual number of liars ( L ) must be even (the negation of \\"odd number of liars\\" is \\"even number of liars\\"). 4. Given the total number of inhabitants must be either even or odd (since a sum of an even and an odd number is odd and a sum of two even or two odd numbers is even), let's explore whether the total of 2021 inhabitants is possible: - Since 2021 is an odd number, one of ( K ) and ( L ) must be odd, and the other must be even. Thus, either ( K ) is odd and ( L ) is even, or ( K ) is even and ( L ) is odd. 5. For the statement made, liars must contradict the presence of knights or the parity of the number of liars. Examine two cases: - **Case 1:** There's an even number of knights (( K ) is even). In this case, knights (truth-tellers) have stated this fact correctly. The liars must contradict the presence of an even number of liars. Hence, for their statement to be false, the actual number of liars ( L ) must be even (because claiming \\"odd\\" while ( L ) is \\"even\\" makes it a lie). - **Case 2:** There's an odd number of liars (( L ) is odd). This claim must also come from liars, but it contradicts itself, as liars stating that ( L ) is odd would be false. 6. Since the island's inhabitants confirm ( K ) is even or ( L ) is even, let's check the conditions: - Combine both in terms of ( K ) being even and ( L ) being even, which is logically inconsistent with having ( N = K + L = 2021 ). # Conclusion: Therefore, it's impossible for the island to have 2021 inhabitants if the number of knights and liars, along with their structured behavior, makes any combined account of even distribution without inherent self-contradiction based on their statements.

If |PF|=frac{5}{2}, then the coordinates of point P are ______; the equation of the asymptote of the hyperbola is ______.","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Identifying the Focus of the Parabola**: The given parabola is y^{2}=4x. The standard form of a parabola with its vertex at the origin and opening to the right is y^2 = 4ax, where the focus is at (a, 0). Comparing, we find a = 1, so the focus F of the parabola is at (1,0). 2. **Relation Between a^2, b^2, and c^2**: For a hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1, the relationship between a, b, and the distance from the center to a focus c is given by c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Given that the parabola and hyperbola share a focus, we have c^2 = 1^2 = 1. Therefore, a^2 + b^2 = 1. 3. **Finding Coordinates of Point P**: Let the intersection point P have coordinates (frac{y_0^2}{4}, y_0). The distance |PF| is given by the distance formula: [ |PF| = sqrt{left(frac{y_0^2}{4} - 1right)^2 + y_0^2} = frac{5}{2} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ left(frac{y_0^2}{4} - 1right)^2 + y_0^2 = frac{25}{4} ] Simplifying, we find y_0^2 = 6. Therefore, the coordinates of P are left(frac{3}{2}, pmsqrt{6}right). 4. **Determining a^2 and b^2**: Since P lies on the hyperbola, substituting x = frac{3}{2} and y = pmsqrt{6} into the hyperbola equation gives: [ frac{9}{4a^2} - frac{6}{b^2} = 1 ] Along with the equation a^2 + b^2 = 1, solving these equations yields a^2 = frac{1}{4} and b^2 = frac{3}{4}. 5. **Equation of the Asymptote**: The equation of the asymptote for the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 is frac{x}{a} = pm frac{y}{b}. Substituting a^2 = frac{1}{4} and b^2 = frac{3}{4}, we get a = frac{1}{2} and b = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Therefore, the equation of the asymptote simplifies to sqrt{3}x pm y = 0.

Notice ( p_i )'s exist, or else ( d = 1 ), which is absurd by the problem statement. So ( d mid 2^{2^k} + d implies d = 2^j ). 11.

Since each box contains 48 cookies and she collected 2 boxes, we can calculate this as: [2 times 48 = 96] Next, we determine the number of cookies in a quarter of a box. Since there are 48 cookies in a full box, a quarter of this would be: [48 div 4 = 12] Grayson collected 3 quarters of a box, so the number of cookies he collected is: [12 times 3 = 36] Olivia collected 3 boxes, and since each box contains 48 cookies, she collected: [48 times 3 = 144] Finally, to find the total number of cookies collected by Abigail, Grayson, and Olivia, we add their individual totals together: [96 + 36 + 144 = 276] Therefore, the total number of cookies they collected for the bake sale is boxed{276}."},{"prompt":"Determine the coefficient of x^{3} in the expansion of (2x+sqrt{x})^{5}.","completion":"The general term of the expansion of (2x+sqrt{x})^{5} is given by T_{k+1}=C_{5}^{k}(2x)^{5-k}cdot (sqrt{x})^k=C_{5}^{k}2^{5-k}x^{5-frac{k}{2}}, where kin{0,1,2,3,4,5}.

In all, he went 18 miles that day. How many miles was Sam’s morning run?","completion":"To solve for the distance Sam ran in the morning, we denote that distance as X miles. Given that Sam walked twice the distance through the store as he had run that morning, the distance he walked can be represented as 2X miles. Additionally, it is given that Sam biked for 12 miles in the evening. The total distance covered by Sam throughout the day is given as 18 miles. This total distance includes his morning run, his walk through the store, and his bike ride in the evening. Therefore, the sum of the distances covered by running and walking is 18 - 12 = 6 miles. This is because the biking distance is subtracted from the total distance to find the combined distance of running and walking. We can then set up the equation for the combined distances of running and walking as X + 2X = 3X miles. According to the information, this equals 6 miles, so we have 3X = 6 miles. To find the distance Sam ran in the morning, we solve for X by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which gives us X = frac{6}{3} = 2 miles.

Since pipe A can fill the cistern in 60 minutes, its rate is 1/60 of the cistern per minute. Similarly, since pipe B can fill the cistern in 75 minutes, its rate is 1/75 of the cistern per minute. When all three pipes are opened, they collectively fill the cistern in 50 minutes. This means that the combined rate of pipes A and B minus the rate of pipe C equals the reciprocal of the time it takes to fill the cistern with all three pipes open, which is 1/50 of the cistern per minute. So we have the equation: A + B - C = 1/50 Substituting the rates of A and B, we get: (1/60) + (1/75) - C = 1/50 To solve for C, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60, 75, and 50 is 300. So we convert the fractions: (5/300) + (4/300) - C = 6/300 Combining the fractions on the left side, we get: (5 + 4)/300 - C = 6/300 9/300 - C = 6/300 Subtracting 9/300 from both sides to isolate C, we get: -C = 6/300 - 9/300 -C = -3/300 C = 3/300 C = 1/100 This means that the third pipe can empty 1/100 of the cistern per minute.

Since the fishbowl is also cube-shaped, the volume of water displaced by the iron cube will be the same as the volume of the iron cube itself. The fishbowl has an edge length of 20 cm, so its base area (A_base) is: A_base = side^2 A_base = 20 cm * 20 cm A_base = 400 square centimeters (cm²) The volume of water displaced by the iron cube will cause the water level to rise by a certain height (h_rise). The volume of the displaced water (V_displaced) is equal to the volume of the iron cube, so: V_displaced = A_base * h_rise 1000 cm³ = 400 cm² * h_rise Now we solve for h_rise: h_rise = 1000 cm³ / 400 cm² h_rise = 2.5 cm Therefore, the water level in the fishbowl will rise by boxed{2.5} centimeters after the iron cube is completely submerged."},{"prompt":"The diagram shows five circles connected by five line segments.

Since the total mix is 100 pounds and Joey used 52 pounds of Columbian coffee, the remaining is Brazilian coffee: 100 pounds (total mix) - 52 pounds (Columbian coffee) = 48 pounds (Brazilian coffee) Now, let's calculate the cost of the Brazilian coffee: 48 pounds of Brazilian coffee at 3.75 per pound = 48 * 3.75 = 180 Now we can find the total cost of the mix: Total cost = Cost of Columbian coffee + Cost of Brazilian coffee Total cost = 455 + 180 = 635 Finally, we divide the total cost by the total weight of the mix to find the price per pound of the final coffee mix: Price per pound = Total cost / Total weight Price per pound = 635 / 100 pounds = 6.35 So, the price per pound of the final coffee mix is boxed{6.35} ."},{"prompt":"A plane takes off at 6:00 a.m. from New York City to Chicago with an average speed of 500 miles per hour.

The effective speed of the plane from New York to Chicago is reduced by the headwind, so we subtract the headwind speed from the plane's average speed: Effective speed = Average speed - Headwind speed Effective speed = 500 mph - 50 mph Effective speed = 450 mph Now, we can calculate the time taken to cover the distance between New York and Chicago: Time = Distance / Effective speed Time = 800 miles / 450 mph Time ≈ 1.78 hours The plane stays in Chicago for 1 hour, so we add that to the time: Time in Chicago = 1.78 hours + 1 hour Time in Chicago ≈ 2.78 hours Next, let's calculate the time taken to fly from Chicago to Miami. For the second leg of the journey, the effective speed of the plane is increased by the tailwind, so we add the tailwind speed to the plane's average speed: Effective speed = Average speed + Tailwind speed Effective speed = 550 mph + 25 mph Effective speed = 575 mph Now, we can calculate the time taken to cover the distance between Chicago and Miami: Time = Distance / Effective speed Time = 1,200 miles / 575 mph Time ≈ 2.09 hours Finally, we add the time taken for both legs of the journey and the layover in Chicago to get the total travel time: Total travel time = Time in Chicago + Time from Chicago to Miami Total travel time ≈ 2.78 hours + 2.09 hours Total travel time ≈ 4.87 hours Therefore, the total time taken to travel from New York to Miami is approximately boxed{4.87} hours."},{"prompt":"Given two nonzero vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} satisfying (overrightarrow{b}2overrightarrow{a})perpoverrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{a}perp(overrightarrow{a}2overrightarrow{b}), the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} is ( ).

Therefore, the difference ( S - 2a_k ) must end in 0 which implies that ( S - 2a_k ) is divisible by 10. Hence, for each ( k ), [ S - 2a_k equiv 0 pmod{10}. ] This means [ 2a_k equiv S pmod{10}. ] 4. **Properties of Digits:** The last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 2 times ) the last digit of ( a_k ). Let ( d_k ) be the last digit of ( a_k ). Then, the last digit of ( 2a_k ) is as follows: - If ( d_k = 0 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 0 ). - If ( d_k = 1 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 2 ). - If ( d_k = 2 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 4 ). - If ( d_k = 3 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 6 ). - If ( d_k = 4 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 8 ). - If ( d_k = 5 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 0 ). - If ( d_k = 6 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 2 ). - If ( d_k = 7 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 4 ). - If ( d_k = 8 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 6 ). - If ( d_k = 9 ), last digit of ( 2a_k ) is ( 8 ). Therefore, for the last digits, there are limited possibilities that need to be considered to satisfy ( 2a_k equiv S pmod{10} ). 5. **Examine Number of Distinct Remainders:** The given numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{111} ) are distinct natural numbers not exceeding 500. Since there are exactly 500 numbers from 1 to 500, and each possible last digit (0 through 9) appears exactly 50 times among those 500 numbers. However, we have 111 numbers placed in a circle. 6. **Contradiction:** For any ( k ), [ S equiv 2a_k pmod{10}. ] This implies that ( 2a_1 equiv 2a_2 equiv cdots equiv 2a_{111} pmod{10} ). Therefore, the last digits of ( 2a_1, 2a_2, ldots, 2a_{111} ) must all be the same. This further implies all ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{111} ) should provide the same remainder when divided by 5, which is impossible because there are only 100 numbers with a fixed remainder out of the set from 1 to 500. 7. **Conclusion:** It is impossible to arrange 111 distinct natural numbers from the set {1, 2, ..., 500} such that for each number, its last digit coincides with the last digit of the sum of all remaining numbers.

In addition, since the product 1990 is divisible by 2 but not by 4, there must be exactly one even number among ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ).

We need to count the number of sequences that differ from a given sequence in exactly 4 positions. 3. **Counting Sequences Differing in Exactly 4 Positions:** The number of ways to choose 4 positions out of 24 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{24}{4} = frac{24!}{4!(24-4)!} = 10626 ] This means there are 10626 sequences that differ from a given sequence in exactly 4 positions. 4. **Disjoint Subsets Argument:** If w is a sequence, the number of sequences in S differing from w in exactly 4 places is at most 6. This is because each such sequence corresponds to a 4-element subset of {1, ldots, 24}, and all such subsets must be disjoint. If they intersect, the corresponding sequences of S would differ in fewer than 8 places, which is not allowed. 5. **Calculating the Upper Bound:** To find the upper bound on the number of sequences, we use the fact that each sequence can have at most 6 other sequences differing in exactly 4 positions.

Identify the problem's requirement that Sofia appended numbers until the entire large number became a multiple of 12. Recall that a number is divisible by 12 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. 3. First, check divisibility by 4: - For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must form a number that is divisible by 4. - Thus, the last number appended should make the last two digits divisible by 4. 4.

Number of tomato plants = 1/4 of 30 = 0.25 * 30 = 7.5 tomato plants. 3. Third garden: 45 plants, 10% are tomato plants. Number of tomato plants = 10% of 45 = 0.10 * 45 = 4.5 tomato plants. 4.

Let's denote the number of students at Slytherin House in Hogwarts as ( n = 30 ). 2. Assume some students are friends, and friendship is mutual. The problem states that no three persons are pairwise friends, meaning there's no triangle in the friendship graph. 3. To find the maximum number of greetings (postcards) sent, let's analyze the properties of the graph formed by friendships. 4. Let's assume that the student with the most friends, say ( x ), has ( 15 + a ) friends (since having more than half of 30 students being friends with one person contradicts the zero-triangle condition due to the Pigeonhole Principle). 5. We start by selecting the groups based on the friendship properties: - The first group consists of these ( 15 + a ) friends of ( x ). None of these ( 15 + a ) persons can be friends with each other (otherwise, it would form a triangle). - The remaining ( 30 - (15 + a) = 15 - a ) students form the second group. 6. Since no student in each group can be friends with another student from the same group, students in each group can only be friends with students in the other group. 7. Every student in both groups will have at most ( 15 - a ) friendships if ( a ) is positive and ( 15 + a ) friendships if ( a ) is negative. 8. Calculate the number of postcards sent within these groups: - Each of the ( 15 + a ) students can have ( 15 - a ) friends. - Each of the ( 15 - a ) students can have ( 15 + a ) friends. - Total greetings by the students in group 1: ( (15 + a) times (15 - a) ) - Total greetings by the students in group 2: ( (15 - a) times (15 + a) ) 9. Summing these together, due to symmetry: [ (15 + a) times (15 - a) + (15 - a) times (15 + a) = 2 times (225 - a^2) ] 10. This simplifies to: [ 450 - 2a^2 ] 11.

The conversion factor between km/hr and m/s is: 1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, to convert 160 km/hr to m/s: 160 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 160 * 1000 / 3600 = 160000 / 3600 ≈ 44.44 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the electric pole. Since the train only needs to cover its own length to completely pass the pole, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance is the length of the train, which is 120 meters, and the speed is 44.44 m/s.

This is evident since if (a_{n} > a_{n+1}), it would contradict the definition of (a_n) as the minimal natural number such that there are no three numbers among ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}) forming a triplet. 2. **Uniqueness and Maximum Twice Repetition**: No number appears more than twice in the sequence. If a number appeared three times, it would form a triplet with itself. For example, if (c) appears thrice, then ((c, c, c)) would be a triplet since (c = frac{c + c}{2}). 3. **Duplicate Numbers**: If (c) first appears as (a_n), then (a_{n+1} = a_n = c). 4. **Reducing the Problem**: For any natural number (k): [a_{2k - 1} = a_{2k}.] Therefore, we only need to prove the inequality for odd indices: [a_{2k-1} leq frac{(2k-1)^2 + 7}{8}.] 5. **Subsequence ({b_k})**: Define (b_k = a_{2k-1}). Hence, we have: [b_k leq frac{(2k-1)^2 + 7}{8}.] 6. **Analyzing the Sequence ({b_k})**: The sequence ({b_k}) strictly increases for (k > 1) and the terms are minimal natural numbers not forming a triplet with elements from ({b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{k-1}}). This holds since the sequence is derived from ({a_n}) and (a_n) is chosen to avoid triplets. 7. **Inequality Analysis**: Assume (n) is the smallest natural number such that: [b_n > frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1.] This implies among the numbers (1, 2, ldots, frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1), exactly ((n-1)) terms are included in ({b_1, ldots, b_{n-1}}). Hence: [b_m leq frac{m(m-1)}{2} + 1 < frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1 text{ for } m < n.] 8. **Counting Gaps (s)**: Define (s) as the count of numbers in ( [1, frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1] ) that do not appear in ({b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1}}). We get: [s = frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1 - (n-1) = frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1 = C_{n-1}^{2} + 1.] Denote these (s) numbers by (d_i, 1 leq i leq s). 9. **Triplet Formation**: By the minimality of each (b_m), for each ( 1 leq k leq s), there exist indices (i_k leq j_k leq n-1) such that ((b_{i_k}, b_{j_k}, d_k)) forms a triplet. Given minimality, each (d_k) is the largest element in its triplet, implying (i_k < j_k). 10. **Contradicting Combinatorial Count**: The number of pairs ((i_k, j_k)) does not exceed (C_{n-1}^{2}), but there are more than (C_{n-1}^{2}) numbers (d_i): [s = C_{n-1}^{2} + 1.] Thus, our assumption leads to a contradiction, ensuring the original inequality must hold for all (n).

First Solution: 1. **Definition of ( K' )**: We define ( K' ) to be a permissible subset of ( H ) if for each vertical line, ( K' ) contains at most two points on it. The horizontal lines can contain any number of points from ( K' ), but each point in ( K' ) must be connected via axis-parallel segments that cover every point in ( H ). 2. **Existence of Permissible Set**: An example of such ( K' ) can be constructed by selecting points in ( H ) that are either the lowest or the highest in their respective vertical lines. These points determine vertical segments that cover all points in ( H ). 3. **Finding the Set ( K )**: Let ( K ) be a permissible set that minimizes the number of ( H )-points covered by closed axis-parallel vertical segments determined by points in ( K ). 4. **Checking Horizontal Lines**: We now need to ensure ( K ) meets the requirement for horizontal lines, limiting each to at most 2 points.

Define ( K' = K setminus { q } cup { q' } ). 6. **Contradiction**: In both cases, ( K' ) is a permissible set that covers every point of ( H setminus K' ), and the number of ( H )-points covered by the segments determined by ( K' ) is strictly less than what was covered by ( K ), which contradicts the minimality of ( K ). 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( K ) must meet the horizontal constraint of having at most two points on each horizontal line.

Step-by-step Solution for the First Proof: 1. Consider an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC and an acute angle alpha at A. Let M be the foot of the altitude from A to BC intersecting BC at T. 2. Observe that triangle AMT and triangle BTC are right triangles and both have the angle angle MAT = angle BTC = frac{alpha}{2}. 3.

By Thales' theorem, angle BC'C = 90^circ. Thus, angle BC'C = alpha, by the properties of inscribed angles subtending the same arc in the circle. 3. Observe that triangle BC'C and triangle C'AC are right triangles. Since angle C'AC = 90^circ, C'A perp AC. Similarly, BT perp AC. 4. Because C'A parallel BT and C'B parallel AM (from perpendicularity conditions), the quadrilateral AC'BM forms a parallelogram. 5. Hence, AM = C'B.

We will show that a triangle with angles ( 120^circ, 30^circ, 30^circ ) and sides ( sqrt{3}, 1, 1 ) satisfies this condition. 1. **Initial Setup and Observation**: Consider an equilateral triangle ( ABC ) with side length ( sqrt{3} ). The center of this triangle is denoted as ( O ). If the vertices ( A, B, C ) are colored such that at least two of them have the same color, then the center ( O ) must have the opposite color to the majority color of the vertices (otherwise, we would have a monochromatic triangle). 2. **Probability Definitions**: Define ( r ) as the probability that from a white point, one reaches a black point by a translation of ( sqrt{3} ). Similarly, define ( s ) for black points. From the previous argument, we have ( r, s geq frac{2}{3} ). 3. **Probability Calculation for Larger Translation**: Let ( t ) be the probability that from a given white point, one reaches a black point by a translation of magnitude ( 2sqrt{3} ). We can express ( t ) in terms of ( r ) and ( s ): [ t = r(1-s) + s(1-r) = r + s - 2rs ] Given ( r, s geq frac{2}{3} ), we calculate: [ t geq frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{3} - 2 left( frac{2}{3} right)^2 = frac{4}{3} - frac{8}{9} = frac{4}{3} - frac{8}{9} = frac{12}{9} - frac{8}{9} = frac{4}{9} = frac{8}{9} ] Thus, ( t geq frac{8}{9} > frac{5}{6} ). 4. **Hexagon Construction**: Consider a regular hexagon ( ABCDEF ) with side length ( 2sqrt{3} ) and center ( O ). By the previous probability argument, if ( O ) is white, then at least 5 of the vertices ( A, B, C, D, E, F ) must be black. 5. **Contradiction**: Without loss of generality, assume ( A, B, C, D ) are black. The centers of the equilateral triangles ( OAB ) and ( OCD ) are denoted as ( X ) and ( Y ), respectively. Since ( O ) is white, ( X ) and ( Y ) must also be white by the previous argument. If we consider the center ( Z ) of the equilateral triangle ( OEF ), then the triangle ( XYZ ) with center ( O ) contradicts the initial assumption that ( O ) must have the opposite color to the majority color of the vertices.

So the second selling price (SP2) would be: [ SP2 = SP1 + 0.25SP1 = 1.25SP1 = 1.25(1.20C) = 1.50C ] In February, the store offered a discount of 20% on SP2. So the final selling price (SPF) after the discount would be: [ SPF = SP2 - 0.20SP2 = 0.80SP2 = 0.80(1.50C) = 1.20C ] Now, the final selling price (SPF) is equal to the initial selling price (SP1), which means the store is selling the sweaters at the price it initially marked up from the cost price. Therefore, the store's profit on the items sold in February is the difference between the final selling price and the cost price: [ Profit = SPF - C = 1.20C - C = 0.20C ] So, the store's profit is boxed{20%} of the cost price of the sweaters."},{"prompt":"Let S be the increasing sequence of positive integers whose binary representation has exactly 8 ones.

So we can write two equations: 1) ( frac{P - 8}{Q + 8} = frac{6}{5} ) 2) ( P - 8 = Q + 8 ) From equation 2, we can express P in terms of Q: ( P = Q + 16 ) Now we substitute ( P ) from equation 2 into equation 1: ( frac{Q + 16 - 8}{Q + 8} = frac{6}{5} ) ( frac{Q + 8}{Q + 8} = frac{6}{5} ) Now we cross-multiply to solve for Q: ( 5(Q + 8) = 6(Q + 8) ) Since both sides have the same term ( Q + 8 ), we can see that the equation will hold true for any value of Q.

The trader sells a part of it at 8% profit and the rest at 12% profit. We know that the quantity sold at 12% profit is 1200 kg, so the quantity sold at 8% profit is Q - 1200 kg. Let's denote the cost price of 1 kg of sugar as C. Then, the selling price of the part sold at 8% profit is C + 0.08C = 1.08C per kg, and the selling price of the part sold at 12% profit is C + 0.12C = 1.12C per kg. The total cost price of the sugar is Q * C, and the total selling price is the sum of the selling price of the part sold at 8% profit and the part sold at 12% profit. The total selling price (SP) can be calculated as follows: SP = (Q - 1200) * 1.08C + 1200 * 1.12C The trader gains 11% on the whole, so the total selling price is also equal to the total cost price plus 11% profit: SP = Q * C + 0.11 * Q * C SP = Q * C * 1.11 Now we can set the two expressions for the total selling price equal to each other: (Q - 1200) * 1.08C + 1200 * 1.12C = Q * C * 1.11 Expanding both sides, we get: 1.08QC - 1.08 * 1200C + 1.12 * 1200C = 1.11QC Now, we can simplify and solve for Q: 1.08QC + (1.12 * 1200C - 1.08 * 1200C) = 1.11QC 1.08QC + (0.04 * 1200C) = 1.11QC 1.08QC + 48C = 1.11QC Subtract 1.08QC from both sides: 48C = 1.11QC - 1.08QC 48C = 0.03QC Divide both sides by 0.03C: Q = 48C / 0.03C Q = 48 / 0.03 Q = 1600 So the total quantity of sugar the trader has is boxed{1600} kg."},{"prompt":"School A and School B each have 3 teachers signing up for volunteer teaching.

The area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles can be visualized as the area of the square minus the areas of the four segments that are outside the square but inside the circles.

Using the value of r = 7 cm, the area of the segments is π * (7 cm)² = 49π cm². Now, subtract the area of the segments from the area of the square to find the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles: Area enclosed = Area of square - Area of segments Area enclosed = 196 cm² - 49π cm² This is the final expression for the area enclosed between the circumferences of the circles.

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Initial Assumptions and Setup:** - We have two mirrors positioned such that they form an angle alpha. - The angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence, according to the law of reflection. - We assume alpha = frac{90^circ}{n} where n is a positive integer. 2. **Single Reflection Analysis:** - When the light ray hits the first mirror, it reflects with an equal angle. - We need to ensure that after a certain number (even) of reflections, the light ray exits the system in the exact opposite direction of its initial path. 3. **Coordinate Setup and Symmetry:** - Let's denote the mirrors as M_1 and M_2. - Define the light ray path as MN after hitting a mirror, where N is the point of incidence on M_1 (first mirror). 4. **Angles and Reflection Symmetry:** - Consider the light ray initially making an angle theta with respect to the normal of M_1. - Reflecting off M_1, the angle of incidence theta is reflected to an angle of 90^circ - theta with respect to M_2, and so on. - Let's observe the transformation through reflections: - 1st reflection at M_1: theta rightarrow alpha - theta - 2nd reflection at M_2: alpha - theta rightarrow 2alpha - theta - This process continues step-by-step, reflecting across M_1 and M_2 successively. 5. **Cumulative Angle Calculation:** - After 2n reflections (where n is the count of complete cycles), include the angle relationships: [ begin{align*} 1^{st} text{ reflection} & : theta xrightarrow{90^circ - theta} alpha - theta 2^{nd} text{ reflection} & : alpha - theta xrightarrow{90^circ - (alpha - theta)} 2alpha - theta 3^{rd} text{ reflection} & : 2alpha - theta xrightarrow{90^circ - (2alpha - theta)} 3alpha - theta end{align*} ] - At (2n+1)^{th} reflection: [ 2nalpha - theta rightarrow 2(n+1)alpha - theta = 180^circ - theta ] 6. **Concluding Structural Proof:** - The calculation shows that after n cycles or completing 2n reflections, the effective angle is 180^circ - theta. - This implies that the angle of incidence will match the reverse path effectively after 2n reflections. - If alpha = frac{90^circ}{n}, multiplying by 2n: 2n times frac{90^circ}{n} = 180^circ ensures the direction has exactly reversed. # Conclusion: Thus, any light ray reflecting several times between mirrors forming an angle alpha = frac{90^circ}{n} will eventually reverse along the original path direction.

Thus, the sum of the remaining integers is: [ S_{n} - x = frac{n(n+1)}{2} - x ] Given that the mean of the remaining (n-1) numbers is (4.75), we can write: [ frac{frac{n(n+1)}{2} - x}{n-1} = 4.75 ] 4. **Solve for (x):** Multiply both sides of the equation by (n-1): [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} - x = 4.75(n-1) ] Simplify the right-hand side: [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} - x = frac{19}{4}(n-1) ] 5. **Equate and Simplify:** Eliminate the fraction by multiplying everything by 4: [ 4 cdot frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 4x = 19(n-1) ] Simplify: [ 2n(n+1) - 4x = 19n - 19 ] [ 2n^2 + 2n - 4x = 19n - 19 ] Isolate (x): [ 2n^2 + 2n - 19n + 19 = 4x ] [ 2n^2 - 17n + 19 = 4x ] Solve for (x): [ x = frac{2n^2 - 17n + 19}{4} ] 6. **Intuitive Constraints on (n):** Since (n leq 9) (explained below), the possible values of (n) are (8) and (9).

According to the problem, we have a tetrahedron (S-ABC), and each vertex must be colored with one of five available colors. Additionally, the vertices at the ends of each edge must have different colors. 2. We start by considering the vertices (S), (A), and (B). Since these vertices must be colored with different colors from the five available, the number of ways to color these three vertices can be determined by the permutations of 3 colors out of 5, denoted by (P_5^3). Therefore, we calculate the permutations as follows: [ P_5^3 = frac{5!}{(5-3)!} = frac{5!}{2!} = frac{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1}{2 times 1} = 5 times 4 times 3 = 60 ] So, there are 60 ways to color the vertices (S), (A), and (B). 3. Once (S), (A), and (B) are colored, we need to consider the coloring of vertex (C). Let's assume the colors of (S), (A), and (B) are 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Thus, (C) can only be colored with one of the remaining colors, which are 2, 4, or 5.

Since there are no pairs to consider, the condition is trivially satisfied. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume we have constructed a set ( A_n = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} ) such that for any ( a_i, a_j in A_n ) with ( a_i < a_j ), the sum ( a_i + a_j ) is square-free. - We need to find an ( a_{n+1} ) such that ( A_{n+1} = A_n cup {a_{n+1}} ) maintains the property that ( a_i + a_{n+1} ) is square-free for all ( a_i in A_n ). 3. **Choosing ( a_{n+1} ):** - Define ( P = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k ) where ( p_i ) are primes and ( p_k ) is the largest prime such that ( sum_{i=k+1}^{infty} frac{1}{p_i^2} < frac{1}{2n} ). - By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), choose ( c ) such that ( a_i + c notequiv 0 pmod{p_i^2} ) for all ( p_i leq sqrt{a_i + c} ). This ensures that ( a_i + c ) is not divisible by any ( p_i^2 ), making ( a_i + c ) square-free. 4. **Bounding the Number of Non-Square-Free Sums:** - Consider a large ( N ) and the sequence ( a_i + kP + c ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots ). - The number of tuples ( (a_1 + kP + c, a_2 + kP + c, ldots, a_n + kP + c) ) that are not square-free can be bounded by: [ sum_{k < p < sqrt{N}} n cdot leftlceil frac{N + O(1)}{P cdot p^2} rightrceil = sum_{k < p < sqrt{N}} n cdot frac{N + O(1)}{P cdot p^2} + Oleft(frac{N}{ln N}right) < frac{(N + O(1))}{2P} + Oleft(frac{N}{ln N}right) ] - This shows that the number of non-square-free sums is less than half the total number of sums, implying that there exists at least one ( a_{n+1} ) such that all sums ( a_i + a_{n+1} ) are square-free. 5. **Conclusion:** - By induction, we can construct ( A_1 subsetneq A_2 subsetneq A_3 subsetneq cdots ) for all finite ( n ). - Taking the union ( bigcup_{n ge 1} A_n ) gives us an infinite set ( M ) where the sum of any two distinct elements is square-free.

This square will enclose all 10 points either inside or on its boundary. 3. **Construct Lines Perpendicular to ( P_1 P_2 )**: Pass lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) through points ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ), respectively, perpendicular to ( P_1 P_2 ). Thus, points ( P_3, P_4, ldots, P_{10} ) are situated between ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) (or on ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 )). 4. **Identify Points Equidistant from ( P_1 P_2 )**: Let ( P_3 ) and ( P_4 ) be points on opposite sides of ( P_1 P_2 ), maximally distant from the line segment ( P_1 P_2 ).

This reflection S maps the first given circle Omega_{1} onto the circle Omega, which is inscribed within the angle angle COD. 2. **Consider Inversion:** We introduce the inversion I with center O, which swaps the positions of the circles Omega and the second given circle Omega_{2}. 3. **Composition of Transformations:** Define the composition H = I circ S. It's important to notice that this composition H maps Omega_{1} to Omega_{2} because: - Reflection S maps Omega_{1} to Omega. - Inversion I then maps Omega to Omega_{2}. 4. **Properties of Transformations:** - Symmetry S rearranges lines passing through O but does not change distances. - Inversion I changes distances to O but does not rearrange lines passing through O. 5. **Individual Actions of H:** Since S switches Omega_{1} and Omega, and I switches Omega and Omega_{2}, the composition H maps Omega_{1} to Omega_{2} and vice versa. Therefore, H must also permute the intersection points E and F of the circles Omega_{1} and Omega_{2}. 6. **Fixed Point Analysis:** If both points E and F stayed where they were under H, this would imply that both points lie on the bisector of angle AOD at the same distance from O, which would mean E and F are the same point.

This condition suggests a relationship that resembles that of a geometric progression, where the product of terms equates to a multiple of another term in the sequence. 2. **Identifying the Sequence Type:** The solution states that the sequence is a geometric progression, which is inferred from the given condition. This is a critical realization that guides the rest of the solution. 3. **Applying the Given Condition:** From a_{2}a_{5}=3a_{3}, it's mistakenly mentioned that a_{3}a_{4}=3a_{3}, which seems to be a misinterpretation of the given condition. However, the correct interpretation should focus on the relationship between a_{2}, a_{5}, and a_{3} in a geometric progression context. The correct approach would involve using the properties of a geometric progression to find the common ratio q and the first term a_{1}. 4. **Finding the Common Difference:** The condition that a_{4} and 9a_{7} have a common difference of 2 is used to establish another equation involving the terms of the sequence and potentially the common ratio if it were a geometric progression. However, in an arithmetic progression, this would relate to the common difference d. 5. **Solving for q and a_{1}:** The solution jumps to solving for q=frac{1}{3} and a_{1}=81 based on the equations derived from the given conditions. This step involves algebraic manipulation and solving for the variables that define a geometric progression: the common ratio q and the first term a_{1}. 6. **Calculating S_{5}:** Finally, with a_{1} and q known, the sum of the first 5 terms of the geometric progression is calculated using the formula S_{n} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^n)}{1-q} for n=5, a_{1}=81, and q=frac{1}{3}. This yields: [ S_{5} = frac{81 times left[1-left(frac{1}{3}right)^5right]}{1-frac{1}{3}} = 121 ] Therefore, the correct answer, following the corrected and detailed steps, should be S_{5} = 121. However, there seems to be a mix-up in the interpretation of the sequence type and the application of formulas. The correct approach for an arithmetic progression problem would involve the common difference d and the first term a_1, and for a geometric progression, the focus would be on the common ratio q and the first term a_1.

When we align these two trapezoids, they form a parallelogram. 3. **Strip Analysis in Parallelogram**: Observe that the stripes from the two trapezoids align perfectly to create seven congruent stripes across the parallelogram. This is because each strip from one trapezoid pairs with a corresponding strip from the rotated trapezoid. 4. **Determine Shaded Stripes**: Given that the stripes are congruent (identical in size and shape), the shaded region of the parallelogram should match the pattern on the original trapezoid. Suppose, out of the seven strips, four are shaded. 5. **Fraction in Parallelogram**: The shaded stripes in the parallelogram therefore cover exactly (frac{4}{7}) of the parallelogram's total area. 6. **Concluding the Equality of Areas**: - Since the two trapezoids that form the parallelogram are identical, the area covered by the shaded stripes in one trapezoid must be half of the shaded area in the parallelogram. - That means that the shaded region covers (frac{4}{7}) of the area of one of the trapezoids. # Conclusion: The fraction of the trapezoid's area that is shaded is (boxed{frac{4}{7}})."},{"prompt":"A triangle (ABC) is inscribed in a circle.

Prove that the result is ( n^2 ).","completion":"To prove by induction that the sum of the largest odd divisors of each integer from n+1 to 2n inclusive is equal to n^2, we proceed as follows: 1. **Base Case**: - Consider n = 1. - The range of integers is from n+1 to 2n, which is from 2 to 2 (just the number 2 itself). - The largest odd divisor of 2 is 1. - Thus, the sum is 1^2 = 1. - The base case holds true. 2. **Inductive Step**: - Assume that the statement holds for some natural number k: that is, the sum of the largest odd divisors of each integer from k+1 to 2k is k^2. - We need to show that the statement holds for n = k + 1, i.e., the sum of the largest odd divisors of each integer from (k+1) + 1 to 2(k+1) is (k+1)^2. - Consider the new range of integers, which is from (k+2) to 2(k+1). - Notice that this range can be divided into two parts: - From k+2 to 2k, which are the elements we had in our previous range. - From 2k+1 to 2k+2. - By the induction hypothesis, the sum of the largest odd divisors of each integer from k+2 to 2k is k^2. - Now, consider the new numbers added to the range: 2k+1 and 2k+2. - The largest odd divisor of 2k+1 is 2k+1 itself, since it is odd. - The largest odd divisor of 2k+2 is the same as k+1, because 2k+2 = 2(k+1). 3. **Combining the sums**: - From the induction hypothesis, the sum of the odd divisors for integers from k+2 to 2k is k^2. - The sum for the numbers 2k+1 and 2k+2 would be: - The largest odd divisor of 2k+1 is 2k+1, and for 2k+2, it is the largest odd divisor of k+1, which we previously accounted for. - Therefore, the additional sum is 2k+1. - Adding this to the earlier sum: [ k^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 ] - This confirms that the sum of the largest odd divisors from k+2 to 2(k+1) inclusive is (k + 1)^2. **Conclusion**: Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the largest odd divisors of each integer from n+1 to 2n inclusive is indeed n^2. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A train 450 meters long is running with a speed of 90 kmph. In what time will it pass a man who is running at 12 kmph in the direction opposite to that in which the train is going?","completion":"To calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man, we need to determine the relative speed between the train and the man. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed. The speed of the train is 90 kmph, and the speed of the man is 12 kmph. Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 90 kmph + 12 kmph Relative speed = 102 kmph Now, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s) because the length of the train is given in meters. To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds Relative speed in m/s = 102 kmph * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Relative speed in m/s = 102 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 102 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in m/s = 102 * (5 / 18) Relative speed in m/s = 510 / 18 Relative speed in m/s = 28.33 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the man is equal to the length of the train, which is 450 meters.

Determine the minimum possible average of all ( binom{2017}{2} ) labels.","completion":"To determine the minimum possible average of the labels on the edges of ( K_{2017} ), we start with an induction hypothesis. We first use the generalization for the complete graph on (2m + 1) vertices, where the answer is (2 - frac{1}{2m+1}). Base Case: For the base case, let's consider ( K_3 ) (a complete graph with 3 vertices). 1. Each edge of ( K_3 ) must be labeled with 1, 2, or 3. 2. The sum of the labels of any triangle ( triangle ABC ) must be at least 5. 3. The only triangles we have in ( K_3 ) are the graph itself, making the sum of its edges 5 or more. By inspection, one simple solution where this holds is labeling each edge (2), for a total sum of (2 + 2 + 2 = 6), and an average label of (frac{6}{3} = 2). This satisfies the form ( 2 - frac{1}{3} ), since ( m=1 ) for ( K_3 ). # Inductive Step: Assume that for the graph ( K_{2m-1} ), the minimum possible average of the edge labels is ( 2 - frac{1}{2m-1} ). Now consider ( K_{2m+1} ): 1. Let's delete an edge ( vw ) that is labeled ( 1 ). This reduces the problem to the labeled complete graph ( K_{2m-1} ). 2. The sum of label values on the edges connecting ( v ) and ( w ) to the rest of the vertices in ( K_{2m+1} ) is at least ( 4(2m-1) = 8m-4 ). By the inductive hypothesis, the total sum of the edges of ( K_{2m-1} ) is: [ binom{2m-1}{2} left( 2 - frac{1}{2m-1} right) ] Adding the contributions from edges touching ( v ) and ( w ) and the deleted edge ( vw ): [ binom{2m+1}{2} left(2 - frac{1}{2m+1}right) = binom{2m-1}{2} left(2 - frac{1}{2m-1}right) + (8m-4) + 1 ] To complete the inductive step, we need to verify that the above addition holds algebraically, confirming our hypothesis. # Equality Cases: Two cases where equality holds: 1. **Case 1:** All edges are labeled (2) except for (m) disjoint edges which have weight (1). This minimizes the average sufficiently, keeping the sum at or above (5) for every triangle. 2. **Case 2:** Split the vertex set into two sets (A cup B) such that (|A| = m) and (|B| = m+1). Then weight all edges in ( A times B ) with (1) and the remaining edges with (3). This satisfies the (5) condition as follows: - Any triangle that includes an edge within ( A ) or ( B ) has sufficient other edges to fulfill the sum greater than (5). # Conclusion: By induction, we've shown the average label value on the edges of ( K_{2m+1} ) achieves its minimum.

We will approach this problem step by step. 1. **Character of Digits**: - The first key insight is that if the decimal representation of the product is made up of only ones, then all digits must be odd. This is because even digits would result in a trailing zero in the decimal representation when multiplied, thus breaking the pattern of all ones. 2. **Modulo 4 Properties**: - Any digit is congruent to either 0, 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. We want to specifically deal with numbers mod 4. Let's consider the numbers whose decimal representation consists only of ones: - This number would have the form (111ldots1). - Note that (111ldots1 equiv -1 pmod{4}). This is given by the noted property: a sequence of ones ( underbrace{111ldots1}_{n , text{times}} ) is congruent to (3 pmod{4}) when (n) is odd and (1 pmod{4}) when (n) is even. - Hence, the number with all ones must be expressible as (4k - 1). 3. **Factorial Analysis**: - We must analyze the factorial N!. Factorial ( N! ) is the product of the first (N) natural numbers. - When N geq 3, the product always includes both even and odd factors. Thus, factorial (N!) is even because it includes at least two even factors (specifically 2 and another multiple of 2). 4. **Parity of (4k-1) numbers**: - Since for large (N), factorial N! contains the even number of terms, it is crucial to note certain properties: - If each number in the factorial were written in terms of mod 4, we need to see how the product properties align. - Essentially because at least half the factors will eventually be even, and since even numbers modulo 4 can be 0 or 2, the product cannot maintain a structure fitting 4k-1 (We use the example of multiplying several even numbers to realize the product keeps it from becoming 4k - 1). 5. **Final Conclusion**: - Therefore, if all digits of the number and the factorial structure of (N!) are analyzed, it is clear from parity and modulo arguments that achieving a sole ones scenario is impossible when extended factorial terms taken. - Hence, this given configuration of (N!) cannot produce a product entirely consistent of digit ones. Conclusively, the product of (N!) among (N geq 3) natural numbers cannot result in a number which looks only like (111ldots1) in its decimal form. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A tap can fill a tank in 16 hours.

Specifically: - The area is zero if B=A. - The area is at most half the bounding box if B in {X, Z}, as determined by half base-height formula. - The area is at most half the area of the bounding box if B=Y, as triangle ABC is contained within either triangle AYZ or triangle AXZ. 5. **Bounding Box Area**: If n moves are made, the bounding box has an area at most left( frac{n}{2} right)^2. 6. **Move Calculation**: - The sum of the width and height of the bounding box increases by at most 1 each move, hence the sum of the width and height is at most n. - By the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM), the product of width and height is at most left( frac{n}{2} right)^2. 7. **Minimum Moves Needed**: To have a bounding box of area 4042: [ left( frac{n}{2} right)^2 geq 4042 implies frac{n}{2} geq sqrt{4042} implies n geq 2sqrt{4042} ] Approximating sqrt{4042}: [ sqrt{4042} approx 63.5 implies n geq 2 cdot 63.5 = 127 ] Since the number of moves must be an integer: [ n geq 128 ] 8. **Verification**: Suppose we start all pins at the point (3, 18).

Any plane containing these points intersects the edges of the cube, and the resulting intersection shape M is a quadrilateral with A and G as opposite vertices. Note that due to the symmetry of the cube and plane intersection, quadrilateral M is a parallelogram. Let P and Q be the other two opposite vertices of M. 2. **Projection of edges**: Consider the projection of the cube’s edges and parallelogram M onto a plane perpendicular to A G (see Figure 1). The projection of the cube's edge network forms a regular hexagon with side length frac{sqrt{6}}{3} and includes three of its main diagonals. The projection of M, denoted P' and Q', passes through the center of the hexagon. 3. **Perpendicular height**: Due to the perpendicular projection, lines P' A and Q' A in the triangles A P G and G Q A, respectively, are equal to the height from A G in those triangles (see Figure 2). Thus, the area t of parallelogram M is given by: [ t = frac{1}{2} P'Q' cdot A G ] Here, A G is constant as it is the body diagonal of a unit cube, hence A G = sqrt{3}. 4. **Extremum lengths**: - The shortest and longest lengths of P' Q' occur as the intersecting plane rotates around A G. The corresponding projections sweep all possible positions. - The minimum length of P' Q' occurs when it is perpendicular to two opposite sides of the hexagon, equaling the face diagonal of the cube sqrt{2}, giving t = frac{sqrt{6}}{2}. - The maximum length of P' Q' occurs when it coincides with a main diagonal of the hexagon, which is frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}, yielding t = sqrt{2}. 5. **Assessment of 3D projections**: These configurations correspond to the sections of cube projections shown in Figures 3a and 3b: - The minimum area scenario corresponds to when M intersects the midpoints of cube edges (P and Q). - The maximum area scenario corresponds to when M intersects opposite cube vertices (P and Q). 6. **Conclusion**: The area t of the intersecting quadrilateral M therefore varies continuously between the minimum and maximum bounds: [ frac{sqrt{6}}{2} approx 1.225 quad text{and} quad sqrt{2} approx 1.414. ] Both extreme values are achievable, and thus every intermediate value is also taken by the intersection area as the plane rotates.

If there is a bidirectional road directly connecting two cities, there exists an edge between the corresponding vertices in G. According to the problem, this graph G has 312 edges and it is connected, meaning there is a path between any two vertices. Also, each vertex has a degree of at most 12. 2. **Graph Simplification**: We know that graph G is a tree-like structure (spanning tree) since G is connected and the maximum degree (12) is quite low compared to the number of vertices (53). 3. **Diameter of the Graph**: To prove that individual can travel to any city within their budget, we need to calculate the diameter D of the graph G. The diameter of a graph is the greatest distance (in edges) between any pair of vertices. 4. **Vertices Dividing**: Let's find an upper bound for D: - Consider any two vertices u and v such that the shortest path between u and v (the uv-path) has length D. - Let V(G) be partitioned into subsets A and B where A includes vertices on the uv-path and B = V(G) setminus A. - |A| = D + 1 (since there are D edges or steps between u and v) and |B| = 52 - D. 5. **Edge Counts**: - Since each vertex on the uv-path (subgraph A) could potentially have edges only among immediate neighbors, the number of edges in A is |E(G[A])| = D. - Since each vertex has a degree of at most 12, the edges between A and B combined with internal edges of B must account for the total number of roads minus those within A: [ |E([A, B])| leq 3|B| = 3(52 - D) ] - Summing all edges gives: [ |E([A, B])| + 2|E(G[B])| leq 12(52 - D) ] 6. **Edge Summing to Verify Diameter**: Combining our expressions, we get: [ |E(G)| = |E(G[A])| + |E([A, B])| + |E(G[B])| ] Substituting into the total: [ 312 = D + frac{|E([A, B])|}{2} + frac{|E([A, B])| + 2|E(G[B])|}{2} ] .

We can write the terms of the sequences as follows: For the arithmetic sequence: begin{align*} a_1 &= x + d, a_2 &= x + 2d, y &= x + 3d. end{align*} For the geometric sequence: begin{align*} b_1 &= xr, b_2 &= xr^2, y &= xr^3. end{align*} Since y is a term in both sequences, we have x + 3d = xr^3. We also know that x neq 0 because if x were 0, then all terms of the geometric sequence would be 0, which contradicts the definition of a geometric sequence. Let us solve for d from the equation: x + 3d = xr^3. Rewriting it, we get 3d = x(r^3 - 1). Since x neq 0, we can express d: d = frac{x(r^3 - 1)}{3}. Because d is the common difference of an arithmetic sequence with real numbers, d can take any real value. This implies that the expression frac{x(r^3 - 1)}{3} must also be able to take any real value, for any real value of r. Thus, the term r^3 - 1 should not restrict x in terms of sign or value, meaning that for any x, there must exist some real r such that r^3 > 1 or r^3 < 1 to accommodate both positive and negative values of x. This leads to the conclusion that x can take any nonzero value. However, since r^2 is part of the geometric sequence, and r = sqrt{frac{y}{x}}, we must have r^2 geq 0. Therefore, y/x geq 0 which gives: - if x > 0, then y geq 0, - if x < 0, then y leq 0. Since the term y is the same in both sequences, it must satisfy both y = x + 3d and y = xr^3. However, we can't have both x and y being negative because that would mean a negative common ratio r, which would not allow the terms b_1 and b_2 to be real if r is negative and y/x is negative (the square root of a negative number is not real). So the only valid scenario is x > 0 and y geq 0. By looking at y = x + 3d, we can see that when d = 0, y = x, which is the minimum value of y. As d increases, y also increases. Consequently, x must be greater than or equal to 4, since if x were less, there'd be a contradiction to y=x+3d having a minimum at x=y. This eliminates the possibility of x being between 0 and 4. Therefore, x must be in the range boxed{[4, +infty)}."},{"prompt":"A license plate in a certain state consists of 5 digits, not necessarily distinct, and 3 letters, also not necessarily distinct.

Equal angles can occur in various configurations, not just as vertical angles. Vertical angles are a specific case where two lines intersect, creating two pairs of opposite (vertical) angles that are equal. Therefore, the statement is incorrect because it overgeneralizes the condition for angles to be equal. 4. **Shortest Line Segment to a Line**: This statement asserts that the shortest line segment connecting a point outside a line to the line is the perpendicular segment. This is a well-established geometric principle. The perpendicular distance from a point to a line is the shortest distance between them. This principle is often used in various geometric proofs and applications. Hence, this statement is correct.

To find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 5, consider the inequality: [ 5k leq 100 ] Dividing both sides by 5, we get: [ k leq frac{100}{5} = 20 ] So, ( k ) ranges from 1 to 20. Therefore, there are 20 natural numbers within the first 100 numbers that are divisible by 5. **Step 3: Determine the number of natural numbers up to 100 divisible by 7.** A number ( n ) is divisible by 7 if and only if ( n = 7k ) for some integer ( k ). To find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 7, consider the inequality: [ 7k leq 100 ] Dividing both sides by 7, we get: [ k leq frac{100}{7} approx 14.28 ] Since ( k ) must be an integer, ( k ) ranges from 1 to 14. Therefore, there are 14 natural numbers within the first 100 numbers that are divisible by 7. **Step 4: Use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find how many numbers are divisible by 5 or 7.** The numbers that are counted both as being divisible by 5 and 7 are the numbers divisible by the least common multiple of 5 and 7, which is 35. A number ( n ) is divisible by 35 if and only if ( n = 35k ) for some integer ( k ). To find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 35, consider the inequality: [ 35k leq 100 ] Dividing both sides by 35, we get: [ k leq frac{100}{35} approx 2.86 ] Since ( k ) must be an integer, ( k ) ranges from 1 to 2. Therefore, there are 2 numbers within the first 100 numbers that are divisible by both 5 and 7. Using the principle of inclusion and exclusion: [ text{Number of numbers divisible by 5 or 7} = 20 + 14 - 2 = 32 ] **Step 5: Compare the two quantities.** We have: - 33 natural numbers divisible by 3. - 32 natural numbers divisible by 5 or 7. **Conclusion:** Since 33 numbers are divisible by 3 and 32 numbers are divisible by either 5 or 7, there are more numbers divisible by 3 among the first 100 natural numbers.

This is because 4^4 = 256, which is greater than 90, and d must be a positive integer greater than 1. 2. For c^3 < 90, the possible values for c are 1, 2, 3, and 4, since 5^3 = 125 is greater than 90. 3. Given b^2 < 90, b can range from 1 to 9, as 10^2 = 100 exceeds 90. 4. a can be any positive integer from 1 to 89, as it is constrained by the remaining value after subtracting b^2, c^3, and d^4 from 90.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed. The speed of the train is 50 km/hr, and the speed of the man is 4 km/hr. Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 50 km/hr + 4 km/hr Relative speed = 54 km/hr Now, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s to match the length of the train, which is given in meters. To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 54 km/hr * (5/18) m/s per km/hr Relative speed in m/s = 15 m/s Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is equal to the length of the train, which is 140 m.

Since a_{2n+1} = -a_{2n} - 2(2n), because 2n is even, then b_n = a_{2n} - a_{2n} - 4n = -4n. Therefore, the sequence {b_n} forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -4.

When p neq frac{1}{2}, {c_n} is not a geometric sequence. The reason is as follows: Since c_{n+1} = a_{2n+2}=pa_{2n+1} + 2n, and as a_{2n+1} = -a_{2n} - 4n from the even case, c_{n+1} = p(-a_{2n} - 4n) + 2n = -pc_n - 4pn + 2n. Thus, frac{c_{n+1}}{c_{n}} = -p + frac{2n(1-2p)}{c_{n}} Therefore, when p = frac{1}{2}, the sequence {c_n} has a first term of 1 and a common ratio of -frac{1}{2}, which is indeed a geometric sequence. Conversely, when p neq frac{1}{2}, {c_n} does not form a geometric sequence. So the answer is dependent on the value of p.

For a parabola that opens downwards (( a < 0 )), the focus is below the vertex, and the directrix is above the vertex. The distance from the vertex to the focus (and to the directrix) is given by ( frac{1}{4|a|} ), where ( a ) is the coefficient of ( x^2 ). Here, ( a = -4 ), so ( frac{1}{4|a|} = frac{1}{16} ).

What is the smallest value of n such that all the sheikhs and their wives can cross to the other bank without breaking the law?","completion":"Let's analyze the problem step by step to find the minimum number n needed for the yacht. Step 1: Understand the Problem We have: - 10 sheikhs. - Each sheikh has 100 wives, so there are a total of 1000 wives. - A yacht with n seats. The rule states: - A woman cannot be with a man other than her husband unless her husband is present. Step 2: Establish the Transport Strategy Consider how to transport 1000 wives and 10 sheikhs without breaking the rule. Since each sheikh must be present if his wives are in the company of another man, we cannot have more than one sheikh's wives with another sheikh. Step 3: Minimum Yacht Capacity To deduce the smallest n , we need to ensure that we can transport all sheikhs and wives without leaving them in compromising situations. Transporting all wives first could be a plausible approach. 1. **Transport Wives First**: - We need to move all 1000 wives to the other shore. - If the yacht has capacity n = 10 , 10 wives can be transported at a time. 2. **Sheikh Transportation**: - After moving all 1000 wives, one wife will return to pick up the sheikhs. - It's essential that the sheikhs are together to avoid the rule violation. Step 4: Example Strategy for Verification Let's break down an example with n = 10 : 1. Continue transporting 10 wives at a time. This would take frac{1000}{10} = 100 trips to move all the wives to the other shore. 2. One wife returns, making it feasible to transport the 10 sheikhs by repeating the following steps: - Batch the sheikhs together and move them by sending them all at once since the yacht size is 10 (all sheikhs can be moved in one go). 3. Continue until all wives are transported: - The process is iterative, with one wife returning each time to make sure that no sheikh's wives are left in a compromising position with other sheikhs. By ensuring the transport runs as described and each return maintains compliance, the number appears to hinge around 10. Conclusion Upon verifying steps and ensuring compliance explicitly lays out that the minimum number n for which the yacht will suffice to transport everyone while adhering to the given rules is indeed 10.

The lines ( AX ), ( BX ), and ( CX ) intersect the sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) at points ( A_1 ), ( B_1 ), and ( C_1 ) respectively. 2. We start by noting that if the circumcircles of triangles ( triangle AB_1C_1 ), ( triangle A_1BC_1 ), and ( triangle A_1B_1C ) all intersect at point ( X ), then ( X ) has special properties. 3. Let us consider the circumcircle of ( triangle AB_1C_1 ). Since it passes through ( X ), we know that ( angle BXC = 180^circ - angle BAC ). This fact comes from the property of cyclic quadrilaterals, where the sum of opposite angles is equal to ( 180^circ ). 4. Similarly, consider the circumcircle of ( triangle A_1BC_1 ). Because ( X ) lies on this circumcircle: [ angle AXB = 180^circ - angle A_1CB. ] By applying the same logic, if we know ( angle BXA = 180^circ - angle ACB ). 5. Additionally, for the circumcircle of ( triangle A_1B_1C ), we can state a similar property: [ angle CXA = 180^circ - angle A_1BC. ] 6.

To confirm, consider that the orthocenter is known to lie within the constructed altitude from ( A ) to ( BC ), from ( B ) to ( AC ), and from ( C ) to ( AB ). Since ( X ) lies at the intersection of these properties and also adheres to cyclic properties for all requisite triangles, we determine that ( X ) is indeed the orthocenter.

We know that ( omega^3 = 1 ) and ( 1 + omega + omega^2 = 0 ). 3. **Generating functions**: The binomial theorem tells us that: [ 2^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} ] Similarly, we can use the roots of unity to split this sum into parts where the exponents are congruent to ( 0 ), ( 1 ), and ( 2 ) modulo ( 3 ): [ (1+omega)^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} omega^k ] [ (1+omega^2)^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} omega^{2k} ] 4. **Summing the generating functions**: We can express the sums ( s_{0,n} ), ( s_{1,n} ), and ( s_{2,n} ) using these generating functions: [ s_{0,n} = sum_{k equiv 0 pmod{3}} binom{n}{k} ] [ s_{1,n} = sum_{k equiv 1 pmod{3}} binom{n}{k} ] [ s_{2,n} = sum_{k equiv 2 pmod{3}} binom{n}{k} ] 5. **Using the properties of roots of unity**: We can use the fact that ( 1 + omega + omega^2 = 0 ) to write: [ 2^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} ] [ (1+omega)^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} omega^k ] [ (1+omega^2)^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} omega^{2k} ] 6. **Combining the sums**: We can combine these sums to isolate the terms we are interested in: [ s_{0,n} = frac{2^n + (1+omega)^n + (1+omega^2)^n}{3} ] [ s_{1,n} = frac{2^n + omega (1+omega)^n + omega^2 (1+omega^2)^n}{3} ] [ s_{2,n} = frac{2^n + omega^2 (1+omega)^n + omega (1+omega^2)^n}{3} ] 7. **Simplifying the expressions**: We know that ( 1 + omega = -omega^2 ) and ( 1 + omega^2 = -omega ). Therefore: [ (1+omega)^n = (-omega^2)^n = (-1)^n omega^{2n} ] [ (1+omega^2)^n = (-omega)^n = (-1)^n omega^n ] 8. **Evaluating the sums for specific cases**: We need to consider the cases where ( n equiv 0 pmod{3} ), ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ), and ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ). - For ( n equiv 0 pmod{3} ): [ s_{0,n} = frac{2^n + 2(-1)^n}{3} ] [ s_{1,n} = frac{2^n - (-1)^n}{3} ] [ s_{2,n} = frac{2^n - (-1)^n}{3} ] - For ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ): [ s_{0,n} = frac{2^n - (-1)^n}{3} ] [ s_{1,n} = frac{2^n + 2(-1)^n}{3} ] [ s_{2,n} = frac{2^n - (-1)^n}{3} ] - For ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ): [ s_{0,n} = frac{2^n - (-1)^n}{3} ] [ s_{1,n} = frac{2^n - (-1)^n}{3} ] [ s_{2,n} = frac{2^n + 2(-1)^n}{3} ] 9. **Evaluating for ( n = 1000 )**: Since ( 1000 equiv 1 pmod{3} ): [ s_{0,1000} = frac{2^{1000} - (-1)^{1000}}{3} = frac{2^{1000} - 1}{3} ] [ s_{1,1000} = frac{2^{1000} + 2(-1)^{1000}}{3} = frac{2^{1000} + 2}{3} ] [ s_{2,1000} = frac{2^{1000} - (-1)^{1000}}{3} = frac{2^{1000} - 1}{3} ] The final answer is ( s_{0,1000} = boxed{frac{2^{1000} - 1}{3}}, s_{1,1000} = boxed{frac{2^{1000} + 2}{3}}, s_{2,1000} = boxed{frac{2^{1000} - 1}{3}} )"},{"prompt":"Kaleen filled a bucket with 0.75 gallon of water.

Given that we select (n) points from the circumference, if there always exists three points forming an equilateral triangle that are the same color, what is the smallest possible value of (n)? 1. **Step 1:** Identify the desired value of (n geq 13). To start, we need to demonstrate why (n) must be at least 13. 2. **Step 2:** Apply the pigeonhole principle. According to the pigeonhole principle, if we have (n = 13) points colored in three colors, there must be at least [ leftlfloor frac{13-1}{3} rightrfloor + 1 = 5 ] points of the same color (say red). Here, (leftlfloor cdot rightrfloor) represents the floor function. 3. **Step 3:** Consider these 5 red points. Extracting 5 points necessarily means that some of them will align to form an equilateral triangle. To illustrate this, observe that among any selection of 5 points on the circumference, there will be at least one triple that forms an equilateral triangle. 4. **Step 4:** By selecting any 5 points of the same color, no matter their configuration on the circle, we ensure the formation of a monochromatic equilateral triangle among the three chosen ones. 5. **Step 5:** Verify that (n = 12) does not meet the requirements. Consider the following configuration: take three squares, each inscribed in the circle with vertices labeled sequentially as (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4), (B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4), and (C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4). Color each square's vertices entirely using one color: say red, another one yellow, and the last one, blue. 6. **Step 6:** Observe that any three same-colored vertices chosen (say from Red) will always form a right triangle (e.g., right angles in squares). This means these right-angled triangles cannot be equilateral, thus showing (n=12) is insufficient. # Conclusion: Hence, the smallest value (n) such that there always exists three points of the same color forming an equilateral triangle when coloring the circle in three colors is [ boxed{13} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the sum of the first n terms of the positive arithmetic geometric sequence {a_n} is S_n, and frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} < 1, if a_3 + a_5 = 20 and a_2 cdot a_6 = 64, then S_6 = ( ) A: 63 or 126 B: 252 C: 126 D: 63","completion":"Since frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}} < 1, 0 < q < 1, Given that a_2 cdot a_6 = a_3 cdot a_5 = 64 and a_3 + a_5 = 20, a_3 and a_5 are the two roots of the equation x^2 - 20x + 64 = 0, Since a_n > 0 and 0 < q < 1, a_3 > a_5, Hence, a_3 = 16 and a_5 = 4, Thus, q = frac{1}{2}, Hence, a_1 = 64, a_2 = 32, a_3 = 16, a_4 = 8, Thus, S_6 = frac{64 cdot [1 - (frac{1}{2})^6]}{1 - frac{1}{2}} = 126, Therefore, the answer is boxed{C}.

Here is the detailed step-by-step proof showing that Danil can always guarantee a win by following a specific strategy. 1. **Initial Position and Rules**: - The game is played on a (2017 times 2017) square board. - A chess bishop is initially placed at the bottom-left corner of the board. - Players take turns to move the bishop, starting with Alexey. - The bishop moves diagonally any number of squares and must not enter a square that it has already visited. - A player loses if they cannot make a move. 2. **Main Diagonal Analysis**: - The main diagonal of the board consists of the squares ((1, 1), (2, 2), ldots, (2017, 2017)). 3. **Danil's Strategy**: - Danil's winning strategy is based on ensuring that he always moves the bishop to a square that is either on the main diagonal or symmetrically positioned with respect to the main diagonal. - Here is the step-by-step strategy: - **Step 1**: If Alexey moves the bishop to a square on the main diagonal, Danil should move the bishop to any other square on the main diagonal that has not been visited before. - This can always be done because initially, the number of unvisited squares on the main diagonal is odd (2017 squares). - Every time Alexey makes a move on the diagonal, the number of unvisited squares on this diagonal becomes even. - Danil’s move will then make it odd again, ensuring there is always an available move for Danil on the main diagonal. - **Step 2**: If Alexey moves the bishop to a square that is not on the main diagonal, Danil should mirror Alexey's move relative to the main diagonal. - For example, if Alexey moves to square ((a, b)) with (a neq b), Danil should move to the square ((b, a)). - The mirrored move will always be available since no move to these squares has been made before in this symmetric approach. 4. **Justification of the Strategy**: - This strategy ensures that Danil always has a move available. - Since the total number of squares on the board is finite ((2017 times 2017) = 4,068,289 squares), eventually the board will run out of available squares for valid moves. - Because Danil's strategy ensures that he always has a move, it follows that Alexey will be the one who runs out of moves eventually. # Conclusion By following the detailed steps and strategy, we conclude that Danil can always guarantee a win regardless of Alexey’s moves.

This gives us the intermediate equation y = 4x^2 + 6. 2. **Shift Right by 9 Units:** To shift the parabola 9 units to the right, we subtract 9 from the x-value inside the function.

Since the diagram indicates that the shaded areas are equal, we start by considering the equal-area segments within the circles. Given that the 12 segments are equal in area, we can compute the area of one sector in terms of the radii. 3. We will divide the total circular area into equal sectors, so the area of each sector for any circle is (frac{1}{12}) of the total area of that circle. 4. Calculate the total area enclosed by each circle: [ t_1 = frac{pi r_1^2}{4}, quad t_2 = frac{pi (r_2^2 - r_1^2)}{4}, quad t_3 = frac{pi (r_3^2 - r_2^2)}{4} ] 5. Since the areas of the sectors are equal, [ frac{pi r_1^2}{4} = frac{pi (r_2^2 - r_1^2)}{4} = frac{pi (r_3^2 - r_2^2)}{4} ] 6.

Let's first calculate the left side without the remainder R: 44 * 432 = 19008 Now, we know that when N is divided by 39, the remainder is 15, so N must be 15 more than a multiple of 39. Let's find the multiple of 39 that is closest to 19008 but not greater than it: 19008 - 15 = 18993 Now, let's divide 18993 by 39 to find the quotient Q: 18993 / 39 = 487 (with no remainder) So, the closest multiple of 39 to 19008 is 39 * 487 = 18993. Now, let's find the remainder R when N is divided by 44: N = 39 * 487 + 15 N = 18993 + 15 N = 19008 We already calculated that 44 * 432 = 19008, so the remainder R when N is divided by 44 is 0.

Each servant of a wealthy man brought a purse with gold and stood in line in front of the tent to give the ransom. Each servant entering the tent places the brought purse on the table in the center of the tent and, if a purse of this or greater weight has not previously been brought, the wealthy man is released along with the servant. Otherwise, the servant is instructed to bring another purse, which should be heavier than all those currently on the table. After fetching the next purse, the servant goes to the end of the line. Fetching a purse takes the same time for everyone, so the sequence of entering the tent is not disrupted. When Robin Hood released all the captives, he had on his table: a) 28; b) 27 purses. In which order was the servant of the wealthy man, who was released last, standing in the original line? To understand the problem, we should first interpret the conditions: 1. Whenever a purse is brought that is heavier than any previously brought, that wealthy man is released, reducing the number of remaining captives. 2. If the purse is not the heaviest, the servant brings another purse and re-enters the queue. 3. The process continues until all are released. Given these conditions and denoting N as the number of wealthy men initially captured (N = 7): Step-by-Step Solution for Case (a): 1. Initially, there are 7 wealthy men. 2. The first servant is released immediately by assumption as reasoned in the reference solution. 3. After one is released, there can be at most 6 failed attempts before the next success because every new purse has to be heavier than the previous ones, and our goal is to minimize the number of attempts to release all wealthy men. 4. Using this pattern, we can construct the maximum possible number of purses received by Robin Hood: - 1st release: immediate success (1) - 2nd release: can take at most 1 success + 6 purse fetches (1+6) - 3rd release: can take at most 1 success + 5 purse fetches (1+5); and so on. Total number of purses: [ 1 + (1 + 6) + (1 + 5) + (1 + 4) + (1 + 3) + (1 + 2) + (1 + 1) + 1 = 28 ] Thus, the number of purse placements is summed to be: [ 1 + 1+6 + 1+5 + 1+4 + 1+3 + 1+2 + 1+1 = 28 ] So the last servant, who is the 7th in the initial lineup, would place the last purse which confirms: [ boxed{7} ] Step-by-Step Solution for Case (b): 1. Here, since Robin Hood received only 27 purses, exactly one intermediate sequence of failures must be shorter by one step: 2. This difference implies that a shorter sequence will end earlier, releasing a servant unexpectedly early, causing the total count to stray from the pattern by exactly -1. 3. Analyze possible sequences to identify this shorter path: - Any failing cycle reduced by one step influences the rest of the counting trajectory to conclude before assumed maximum steps.

In the decimal system, (10 equiv 1 pmod{3}). This equivalence means: [ 10^k equiv 1^k equiv 1 pmod{3}. ] 3. Consequently, any power of 10, (10^k), is congruent to 1 modulo 3.

Therefore, the position vector of overrightarrow{QP} is (sqrt{3} - cos x, 1 - sin x). Since f(x) = overrightarrow{OP} cdot overrightarrow{QP}, we have f(x) = (sqrt{3}, 1) cdot (sqrt{3} - cos x, 1 - sin x) = 3 - sqrt{3}cos x + 1 - sin x.

When cos alpha = dfrac{1}{2}, alpha = 60^{circ}, which contradicts the premise that alpha is the largest angle because with sin alpha = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}, alpha should be 120^{circ} (since sin 120^{circ} = sin (180^{circ} - 60^{circ}) = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}). Therefore, we consider cos alpha = - dfrac{1}{2}, implying alpha = 120^{circ}. By the law of cosines, cos alpha = dfrac{a^2 + (a+2)^2 - (a+4)^2}{2a(a+2)} = -dfrac{1}{2}.

Case 1: (a = n), (b = n + 1), (c = n + 2) Plugging these into our equation: [ (n + 1)^2 = n(n + (n + 2)) ] Simplifying, [ (n + 1)^2 = n(2n + 2) ] [ n^2 + 2n + 1 = 2n^2 + 2n ] Subtract (n^2 + 2n + 1) from both sides: [ 0 = n^2 - 1 ] [ n^2 = 1 ] Therefore, [ n = 1 quad text{or} quad n = -1 ] Since (n) must be positive: [ n = 1 ] Hence, the side lengths are: [ a = 1, quad b = 2, quad c = 3 ] However, a triangle with sides 1, 2, and 3 does not satisfy the triangle inequality (a + b > c): [ 1 + 2 not> 3 ] So, this case is not valid. Case 2: (a = n), (b = n + 2), (c = n + 1) Plugging these values into our equation: [ (n + 2)^2 = n(n + (n + 1)) ] Simplifying, [ n^2 + 4n + 4 = n(2n + 1) ] [ n^2 + 4n + 4 = 2n^2 + n ] Rearranging all terms to one side: [ 0 = n^2 - 3n - 4 ] This is a quadratic equation, solving it using the quadratic formula (n = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}): [ n = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = frac{3 pm 5}{2} ] Therefore, [ n = 4 quad text{or} quad n = -1 ] Since (n) must be positive, [ n = 4 ] Hence, the side lengths are: [ a = 4, quad b = 6, quad c = 5 ] This is a valid case. Case 3: (a = n + 1), (b = n + 2), (c = n) Plugging these values into our equation: [ (n + 2)^2 = (n + 1)(n + 1 + n) ] Simplifying, [ n^2 + 4n + 4 = (n + 1)(2n + 1) ] [ n^2 + 4n + 4 = 2n^2 + n + 1 ] Rearranging all terms to one side: [ 0 = n^2 - 3n - 3 ] This is another quadratic equation, solving it using the quadratic formula: [ n = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 + 12}}{2} = frac{3 pm sqrt{21}}{2} ] This does not yield an integer solution, and thus not applicable for natural numbers. # Conclusion The only valid triangle with consecutive natural side lengths where one angle is twice another is the one with side lengths 4, 5, and 6.

For which values of n can you achieve a checkerboard pattern where the black and white colors have swapped places through a series of moves?","completion":": 1. Consider a square grid of size n times n, where the cells are colored in a checkerboard pattern (alternating black and white). At least one of the corner cells is black. 2. We are allowed to repaint any 2 times 2 sub-grid by changing the color of each cell according to the rule: - White to black, - Black to green, - Green to white. 3. We need to determine for which values of n it is possible to obtain a checkerboard pattern where black and white colors have swapped places after several moves. Let's analyze the condition: 1. Assume that we have managed to repaint the cells as required. Let's call: - Cells initially white as type-1 cells, - Cells initially black as type-2 cells. 2. Note that if a cell is repainted exactly three times, it returns to its original color. - Therefore, to change a type-1 cell to black by alternating its state, it needs to be repainted 3k+1 times, for some integer k. - To change a type-2 cell to white, it needs to be repainted 3m+2 times, for some integer m. Calculate the total repaints: 1. Let a be the number of type-1 cells, and b be the number of type-2 cells. 2. The total number of repaints of type-1 cells will be 3K + a for some integer K. 3. The total number of repaints of type-2 cells will be 3M + 2b for some integer M. 4. In any 2 times 2 sub-grid, there are equal numbers of cell type-1 and cell type-2. Therefore, the total repaints of type-1 and type-2 cells must be equal: [ 3K + a = 3M + 2b ] This implies: [ a + b = 3(M - K + b) ] Determining n: 1. This equality suggests that a + b, which is the total number of cells (n^2), must be divisible by three: [ n^2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Therefore, ( n equiv 0 pmod{3} ). Constructing a 3k times 3k square: 1. When n = 3k, we can divide the grid into smaller 3 times 3 sub-grids. 2. Each 3 times 3 sub-grid will either have corner cells that are all black or all white, - Case 1: If corner cells are black, repaint each of the four 2 times 2 sub-grids touching the corners once, - Case 2: If corner cells are white, repaint each of the four 2 times 2 sub-grids touching the corners twice. 3. It's observed that after these repaints, the overall checkerboard pattern switches such that black and white cells swap places.

So, frac{mathrm{B}(alpha + 2, beta)}{mathrm{B}(alpha, beta)} = frac{frac{(alpha + 1) alpha Gamma(alpha) Gamma(beta)}{Gamma(alpha + beta + 2)}}{frac{Gamma(alpha) Gamma(beta)}{Gamma(alpha + beta)}} = frac{alpha (alpha + 1)}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)}. Thus, mathrm{E}(X^2) = frac{alpha (alpha + 1)}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)}. Finally, the variance mathrm{D}(X) is given by: mathrm{D}(X) = mathrm{E}(X^2) - (mathrm{E}(X))^2 = frac{alpha (alpha + 1)}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)} - left(frac{alpha}{alpha + beta}right)^2. Simplify the expression: mathrm{D}(X) = frac{alpha (alpha + 1)}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)} - frac{alpha^2}{(alpha + beta)^2}. Combine the terms over a common denominator (alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)^2: mathrm{D}(X) = frac{alpha (alpha + 1)(alpha + beta) - alpha^2 (alpha + beta + 1)}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)^2}. Simplifying the numerator: = frac{alpha (alpha^2 + alpha beta + alpha + beta) - alpha^2 (alpha + beta + 1)}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)^2}. = frac{alpha (alpha^2 + alpha beta + beta) - alpha^2 (alpha + beta + 1)}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)^2}. = frac{alpha (alpha beta + beta) - alpha^2 beta + alpha^2 beta}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)^2}. = frac{alpha^2 beta}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)^2}. Therefore, mathrm{D}(X) = frac{alpha beta}{(alpha + beta + 1)(alpha + beta)^2}.

The total number of balls in the bag is 100, and we know that there are 20 white, 30 green, 37 red, and 3 purple balls.

The probability that a ball chosen at random will be neither red nor purple is given as 0.6 (or 60%). This means that 60% of the balls in the bag are white, green, or yellow.

Speed of man in m/s = (Speed in kmph) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed of man in m/s = 3 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of man in m/s = 3 * (10 / 36) Speed of man in m/s = 3 * (5 / 18) Speed of man in m/s = 15 / 18 Speed of man in m/s = 5 / 6 m/s Now, let's calculate the relative speed using the time it takes for the train to cross the man and the length of the train.

For odd n, the equation becomes a_{n+1} - a_n = 3n - 1. 2. For even n, the equation becomes a_{n+1} + a_n = 3n - 1. Let's examine the first few terms to understand the pattern: - For n=1, we have a_2 - a_1 = 2. - For n=2, we have a_3 + a_2 = 5. - For n=3, we have a_4 - a_3 = 8. - For n=4, we have a_5 + a_4 = 11. From this pattern, we notice two sequences forming: - The sum of every two adjacent odd-indexed terms starting from the first term is 3, i.e., a_1 + a_3 = 3, a_5 + a_7 = 3, and so on. - The sum of every two adjacent even-indexed terms starting from the second term forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term 13 and a common difference of 24, i.e., a_2 + a_4 = 13, a_6 + a_8 = 37, a_8 + a_10 = 61, and so on. To find the sum of the first 60 terms, S_{60}, we calculate the sum of these two patterns separately and then combine them: - The sum of the odd-indexed terms can be grouped into 15 pairs, each summing to 3, thus contributing 3 times 15 to S_{60}. - The sum of the even-indexed terms can be grouped into 15 pairs, starting with 13 and increasing by 24 each time. The sum of these pairs is an arithmetic series with the first term 13, the common difference 24, and 15 terms. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by frac{n}{2}(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. Therefore, the contribution of the even-indexed terms to S_{60} is 13 times 15 + frac{15 times 14}{2} times 24.

The number of stones required is 3600. What is the length of each stone?","completion":"To find the length of each stone, we need to determine the total area of the hall and then divide that by the number of stones and the width of each stone. First, let's convert the dimensions of the hall to decimeters (dm), since the width of the stones is given in decimeters. There are 10 decimeters in a meter. Length of the hall in dm = 36 m * 10 dm/m = 360 dm Width of the hall in dm = 15 m * 10 dm/m = 150 dm Now, let's calculate the total area of the hall in square decimeters (dm²): Area of the hall = Length of the hall * Width of the hall Area of the hall = 360 dm * 150 dm Area of the hall = 54000 dm² Next, we know that the number of stones required is 3600 and the width of each stone is 5 dm. Let's calculate the area covered by one stone: Area of one stone = Length of one stone * Width of one stone Since we don't know the length of one stone yet, let's call it \\"L\\" (in dm). The width of one stone is given as 5 dm. So the area of one stone is: Area of one stone = L * 5 dm² Now, let's find the total area covered by all 3600 stones: Total area covered by stones = Area of one stone * Number of stones Total area covered by stones = (L * 5 dm²) * 3600 We know that the total area covered by the stones should be equal to the area of the hall, which is 54000 dm². So we can set up the equation: (L * 5 dm²) * 3600 = 54000 dm² Now, let's solve for L: L * 5 dm² * 3600 = 54000 dm² L * 18000 dm² = 54000 dm² L = 54000 dm² / 18000 dm² L = 3 dm So the length of each stone is boxed{3} dm, which is equivalent to 0.3 meters."},{"prompt":"is known that F(0,1) is a focus of the ellipse C with its center at the origin O, and the eccentricity e of the ellipse C is frac{1}{2}.

(Ⅱ) Solution 1: ① Since M(x_1,y_1), N(x_2,y_2) and k_1 exists, we have k_{1}= frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}, Given overrightarrow{OM} + overrightarrow{ON} = lambda overrightarrow{OA}, lambda neq 0 and k_2 exists, we get k_{2}= frac{y_{2}+y_{1}}{x_{2}+x_{1}}, Thus k_{1} cdot k_{2} = frac{y_{2}+y_{1}}{x_{2}+x_{1}} cdot frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} = frac{y_{2}^{2} - y_{1}^{2}}{x_{2}^{2} - x_{1}^{2}}.

When Lydia is filling the pool, water is being added at the rate of 1.6 gallons per minute, but at the same time, some of that water is leaking out at the rate of L gallons per minute.

Since ( S ) consists of ( 2n-1 ) different irrational numbers, and adding ( 1 ) (a rational number) to the set, the dimension of ( L ) is at least ( 2 ). 2. **Dual Space and Hyperplane:** The dual space of ( L ), which consists of all linear functionals on ( L ), also has a dimension at least ( 2 ). Therefore, we can find a vector ( v in L ) that is not collinear with ( 1 ). This means ( v ) is not a scalar multiple of ( 1 ). 3. **Hyperplane ( H ):** Consider the hyperplane ( H ) in ( L ) that is orthogonal to ( v ).

In the configuration where P is at P_{0} such that AP_{0} = P_{0}D, the quadrilateral ADCB_{0} forms a symmetrical trapezoid with parallel sides C_{0}B_{0} parallel AD, and K_{0} coincides with P_{0}, because according to the properties of isosceles trapezoids, angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Therefore, DC = DP implies angle DCP = angle DPC = angle BCP and by symmetry, the line K_{0}B_{0} also bisects the angle angle ABC as we intend to prove. Without loss of generality, suppose that AP < PD (i.e., A is closer to P than D is).

Let's follow the process step-by-step: 1. **Place 4 Points:** Let's denote the 4 points as ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). These points can be positioned arbitrarily on the plane as long as no three points are collinear. 2. **Count the Smallest Triangles:** First, consider the individual triangles that can be formed using any three of these points. The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 4 points is computed using the combination formula: [ binom{4}{3} = 4 ] This gives us 4 small triangles: ( triangle ABC, triangle ABD, triangle ACD, ) and ( triangle BCD ). 3. **Count Larger Triangles Formed by Combining Small Triangles:** Next, consider triangles that may be formed by the union of two small triangles. There are configurations where larger triangles enclose regions within the smaller triangles. By examining the possible larger triangle formations, we see that: - Each pair of triangles shares a common vertex, forming a larger triangle by combining the other vertices. - There are 4 such larger triangles formed this way. 4. **Add the Counts:** Summing these contributions: - Small triangles: 4 - Larger triangles: 4 [ 4 + 4 = 8 ] 5. **Conclusion:** Thus, in total, the maximal number of triangles formed by connecting 4 points on a plane is ( 8 ).

In the 10th row, mark only the central cell and all the cells to its left. This gives us: - 9 complete rows each with 19 marked cells: 9 times 19 = 171 cells. - In the 10th row, the mark pattern includes the central cell and those to its left, totaling to 10 marked cells in that row. 3. **Total Marked Cells (Partial Calculation):** Initially: [ 171 text{ (from 9 rows)} + 10 text{ (from the 10th row)} = 181 text{ marked cells} ] 4. **Analyzing Lower Half of the Matrix:** Let's consider an arbitrary 10 times 10 square starting from the bottom half of the matrix. Here, marked cell counts vary based on the rows incorporated. 5. **Case of Shift:** Move the 10 times 10 square one row up at a time and observe the changes: - When the square shifts up by one row, a previously unmarked row exits and a marked row enters. - This increases the number of marked cells by 10 for each shift since the top 9 rows are fully marked, with each having 19 cells. 6. **Count Formula Generalization:** - For the lowest placement, the 10 times 10 square includes 1 marked cell from the 10th row and unmarked cells below, totaling: [ 1 text{ marked cell} ] - On moving one row up: [ 10j text{ marked cells}; quad j text{ ranging from 1 to 9 rows } ] - Consider further up with all marked rows: [ 10i + 1 leq text{ each upper shift }; quad i leq 9 ; text{(due to twice the already defined fixed)} ] 7. **Higher Sub-squares Analysis Understanding:** Highest sub-square contains 10 times 10 and relatively 91 precise equidistantly marked cells (i+10).

They return to (A) simultaneously after one complete revolution. 2. **Reflect Points and Define the Symmetrical Property**: - Let's define a point (P) in such a way that it helps us to show the equidistance of (X) and (X') from (P). - Let point (P) be the reflection of (A) across the perpendicular bisector of the segment (OO') (the centers of the two circles). 3. **Establish Congruence of Triangles**: - To show that (P) is indeed the fixed point we are looking for, we need to show that the triangles (POX) and (P O'X') are congruent. - We know that (A) is the point of intersection, and since the distances and angles about the circles play a symmetrical role, we leverage reflection symmetry to prove the congruence. 4. **Checking Key Distances**: - Because of symmetry, (OP = O'A) and (O'P = OA). - Hence, the distances relating to the reflected point (P) and (O), (O') are symmetrical. 5. **Equal Distances Between Equivalent Points**: - On the circle (Gamma_1), (OX = OA), and because (P) is defined as the reflection through the bisector, (O'P = O'X'). - Similarly, (O'X' = O'A) translates directly into reflections and circumference traversals. 6. **Equal Revolving Angles**: - Since both (X) and (X') move along their respective circles at the same rate and return simultaneously to (A), the angles they traverse in corresponding time intervals are equivalent. - Therefore, the angle traversed by (X) denoted (angle AOX) matches (angle AO'X'). 7. **Using Reflection Properties and Triangle Congruence**: - Given reflection symmetry and equal angles as discussed, let's compare the angles again: (angle AOP = angle AO'P). - Therefore, we have (angle POX = angle P O'X'). 8. **Verifying Congruent Triangles**: - Using the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criteria for triangle congruence: [ begin{aligned} & text{Side } OP = O'P, & text{Angle } angle POX = angle PO'X', & text{Side } OX = O'X' text{ because of the points situated on respective circles and distances maintained symmetrical}. end{aligned} ] - Thus, triangles (POX) and (P O'X') are congruent. 9. **Conclude Equidistance**: - Because the triangles are congruent, the point (P) is equidistant from both (X) and (X'). Therefore, as (X) and (X') move along (Gamma_1) and (Gamma_2) respectively, (P) remains a fixed point, consistently equidistant from both (X) and (X'). Therefore, there is a fixed point (P) in the plane such that the two moving points (X) and (X') are always equidistant from (P), concluding the proof.

Given that AD is the diameter, CN must be perpendicular to CK: [ CN = NK quad text{and} quad AC = AK ] 3.

If the seat is occupied, they sit in the first available free seat. 4. We need to determine the probability that the last passenger, passenger n, sits in their designated seat n. For this to happen, we need to analyze the possible outcomes when passenger n enters the bus. Intermediate Analysis: 5. Each seat will be occupied either by its true owner or by the Absent-minded Scientist. Therefore, by the time passenger n enters, either seat n is free or it has been occupied by the Scientist. 6. We observe that if at any point earlier seat n is taken by someone other than the Scientist or passenger n himself, then seat n can't be free for passenger n at the end. Therefore, we focus on when either: - Absent-minded Scientist takes seat n or - Seat n remains free for the passenger n. 7.

This creates a 50-50 split on the eventual outcome, regardless of the intermediate steps where other passengers might sit. Calculation: 8.

April has 30 days, and John doesn't walk the dog on the 4 Sundays, so he walks the dog for 30 - 4 = 26 days. Out of these 26 days, there are 4 weekends (Saturday and Sunday) but since he doesn't work on Sundays, he only works 4 Saturdays. So, he works 26 - 4 = 22 weekdays. On weekdays, he earns 10 per hour, so for 22 days, he earns 22 days * 10/day = 220. On weekends (Saturdays), he earns 15 per hour, so for 4 days, he earns 4 days * 15/day = 60. Now, for the 3 days that Mark helps him, they split the earnings. These could be either weekdays or weekends, but since we don't have that information, we'll assume they are weekdays for simplicity. So for those 3 days, John earns 3 days * 10/day = 30, but since he splits it with Mark, he only gets 30 / 2 = 15.

John then gives his sister Kaylee 20% of the remaining money. 20% of 250 is 50. So he gives Kaylee 50, leaving him with 250 - 50 = 200.

This can be done as follows: 1. **Understanding the requirement to form a triangle:** For three lengths (a), (b), and (c), with (a leq b leq c), to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality condition: [ a + b > c ] This ensures that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side. 2. **Formulating the strategy:** - Given that there are 100 sticks arranged in increasing length, let's denote the lengths of the sticks as (L_1, L_2, dots, L_{100}) with (L_1 leq L_2 leq dots leq L_{100}). - We need to check the most critical case to ensure the triangle inequality holds for any subset of three sticks. 3. **Critical check:** - The critical check is to verify if the smallest two sticks along with the largest stick can form a triangle.

This is because: [ L_{i} + L_{j} > L_{100}, quad text{for any} i, j in {1, 2, dots, 99} ] will be true as (L_i) and (L_j) are not the maximum lengths and their sum is more likely to be greater than (L_{100}). 5. **Verification process:** - Petya needs to perform one check of the critical inequality: [ L_{98} + L_{99} > L_{100} ] - This single verification is sufficient to conclude that any three sticks from the set can form a triangle if the inequality holds. # Conclusion: Petya needs to make only one critical check to determine if any three sticks from his set can form a triangle.

The problem mentions that the center of the circumscribed sphere lies on the surface of the inscribed sphere. Case Analysis: Case 1: Center of the circumscribed sphere coincides with the center of the base. Case 2: Center of the circumscribed sphere is at a point on the surface of the inscribed sphere, diametrically opposite to the center of the base. # Detailed Analysis: We will proceed with Case 2 for the detailed solution. Denote: - ( R ) as the radius of the circumscribed sphere. - ( r ) as the radius of the inscribed sphere. 1. **Height of the Pyramid:** Since the center of the circumscribed sphere is on the surface of the inscribed sphere, the height ( h ) of the pyramid is the sum of the diameter of the inscribed sphere and the radius of the circumscribed sphere: [ h = 2r + R ] 2. **Side of the Base:** The side length ( a ) of the hexagonal base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem considering the base of the pyramid. A section through the height and the midpoint of one side of the hexagonal base forms an isosceles triangle. Consider the following right-angled triangle formed by the radius connecting the center of the base to the midpoint of one side (half the side length), the radius of the circumscribed sphere as the hypotenuse, and the height difference: [ a = sqrt{R^2 - (2r)^2} = sqrt{R^2 - 4r^2} ] 3. **Triangle Properties:** The vertical section passing through the pyramid's height and the midpoints of one side of the base is an isosceles triangle with: - Height ( h = R + 2r ) - Base ( sqrt{3(R^2 - 4r^2)} ) This triangle has an inscribed circle with radius ( r ). Using the formula for the area and the radius of the inscribed circle, we can express this relationship as follows. 4. **Area of the Triangle:** The area ( A ) of this isosceles triangle can be given by: [ A = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times sqrt{3(R^2 - 4r^2)} times (R + 2r) ] 5. **Radius Inscribed Circle Relationship:** The radius of the circle inscribed in the triangle also relates to the area ( A ) and the semi-perimeter ( s ) of the triangle: [ A = r times s ] where the semi-perimeter ( s ) of the isosceles triangle is: [ s = frac{2 times sqrt{R^2 - 4r^2} + sqrt{3(R^2 - 4r^2)}}{2} ] Substituting ( A ) by the height and base product and simplifying: [ frac{1}{2} times sqrt{3(R^2 - 4r^2)} times (R + 2r) = r times frac{2 times sqrt{R^2 - 4r^2} + sqrt{3(R^2 - 4r^2)}}{2} ] Simplifying this equation to find ( R ) in terms of ( r ): [ 3R^2 - 6Rr - 4r^2 = 0 ] 6. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Solving this quadratic equation: [ 3R^2 - 6Rr - 4r^2 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula ( R = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ): [ R = frac{6r pm sqrt{36r^2 + 48r^2}}{6} = frac{6r pm sqrt{84r^2}}{6} ] [ R = frac{6r pm sqrt{84r^2}}{6} = frac{6r pm 2sqrt{21}r}{6} ] Simplifying yields: [ R = r left(1 pm frac{sqrt{21}}{3}right) ] Thus, the ratio of the radii is: [ frac{R}{r} = 1 + frac{sqrt{21}}{3} = frac{3 + sqrt{21}}{3} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{3 + sqrt{21}}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"There is a square with sides of 12 units.

The area of the square (A_square) is given by the formula: A_square = side^2 Given that each side of the square is 12 units, the area of the square is: A_square = 12^2 = 144 square units Now, let's find the area of the circle. The diameter of the circle is equal to the side of the square since the circle touches the midpoint of each side. Therefore, the radius (r) of the circle is half the side of the square: r = side / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6 units The area of the circle (A_circle) is given by the formula: A_circle = π * r^2 Using the value of r we found: A_circle = π * 6^2 = π * 36 Now, we can calculate the area of the shaded region (A_shaded) by subtracting the area of the circle from the area of the square: A_shaded = A_square - A_circle A_shaded = 144 - π * 36 To get a numerical value, we use the approximation π ≈ 3.14159: A_shared ≈ 144 - 3.14159 * 36 A_shared ≈ 144 - 113.09724 A_shared ≈ 30.90276 square units So, the area of the shaded region is approximately boxed{30.90276} square units."},{"prompt":"f f(ln x) = 3x + 4, then the expression for f(x) is ( ) A: 3ln B: 3ln x + 4 C: 3e^{x} D: 3e^{x} + 4","completion":"Let t = ln x, then x = e^{t}, So, f(t) = 3e^{t} + 4, Therefore, f(x) = 3e^{x} + 4.

C can finish the work in 6 days, so C's work rate is 1/6 of the work per day. When A, B, and C work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate = A's work rate + B's work rate + C's work rate Combined work rate = (1/4) + (1/12) + (1/6) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case: Combined work rate = (3/12) + (1/12) + (2/12) Combined work rate = (3 + 1 + 2) / 12 Combined work rate = 6/12 Combined work rate = 1/2 This means that A, B, and C working together can complete half of the work in one day.

The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length: Perimeter of square = 4 * side length = 4 * 11 = 44 Since the cylinder has the same perimeter as the square, the perimeter of the cylinder, which is the circumference of its base, is also 44.

The total revenue from selling x thousand pieces at 0.9 million yuan per piece is 900x million yuan. The fixed cost is 6200 million yuan. Therefore, we can calculate G(x) for the two intervals of x as follows: - **For 0 < x < 60:** The total cost is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost, which is 6200 + 10x^2 + 100x million yuan. Thus, the profit function G(x) is: [ G(x) = 900x - (10x^2 + 100x) - 6200 = -10x^2 + 800x - 6200 ] - **For x geq 60:** The total cost in this interval includes the fixed cost and the given variable cost for x geq 60. So, the profit function G(x) is: [ G(x) = 900x - (901x + frac{8100}{x} - 21980) - 6200 = -x - frac{8100}{x} + 15780 ] Therefore, the function relationship G(x) in million yuan for the annual profit with respect to the annual output x thousand pieces is: [ G(x) = begin{cases} -10x^2 + 800x - 6200, & 0 < x < 60 -x - frac{8100}{x} + 15780, & x geq 60 end{cases} ] # Part 2: Maximizing the Company's Profit - **For 0 < x < 60:** By completing the square, we find that G(x) = -10(x-40)^2 + 9800. The maximum profit in this interval occurs at x = 40, with G(x)_{max} = 9800 million yuan. - **For x geq 60:** The expression - (x + frac{8100}{x}) + 15780 can be maximized by applying the AM-GM inequality, which gives us -2sqrt{x cdot frac{8100}{x}} + 15780 = 15600. The equality holds when x = frac{8100}{x}, i.e., x = 90. Therefore, at x = 90, G(x)_{max} = 15600 million yuan. Comparing the maximum profits in both intervals, we find that the maximum profit is higher when x = 90. Thus, the company's profit is maximized at an annual output of 90 thousand pieces, with a maximum profit of 15600 million yuan. Therefore, the annual output in thousand pieces for which the company's profit is maximized is 90 thousand pieces, and the maximum profit is boxed{15600} million yuan."},{"prompt":"a race, A covers the distance in 36 seconds and B in 45 seconds.

This means it oscillates between -2 and 2 as x varies, and completes a full cycle every 2 units along the x-axis. 2. **Solving f(x) = 0**: The equation f(x) = 0 translates to -2 sin(pi x) = 0. This occurs when sin(pi x) = 0, which happens at integer values of x within our interval. Therefore, there are five solutions to f(x) = 0 in the interval [-2,2]: x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. 3. **Solving f(x) = y for Nonzero y**: For any fixed nonzero real number y where -2 < y < 2, the equation f(x) = y has four solutions in [-2,2]. This is because within one period of the sinusoidal function, there are two peaks (one positive and one negative), and each peak will correspond to two x-values that map to y. 4. **Transforming the Original Equation**: We transform the equation f(f(f(x))) = f(x) by letting a = f(x), which leads to a = f(f(a)). Then, by letting b = f(a), we get a = f(b).

Since the electric pole can be considered as a point in comparison to the length of the train, the time it takes for the train to pass the pole is the time it takes for the entire length of the train to pass the point where the pole is located.

Is it possible to identify the heaviest and lightest coin in 13 weighings? Given that we need to determine both the heaviest and lightest coin among ten coins, we will detail the steps necessary to achieve this using a balance scale within 13 weighings. 1. **Initial Strategy:** - Observe that a balance scale comparison results in three possible outcomes: the left side being heavier, the right side being heavier, or both sides being equal. Each weighing thus gives us log_2 3 approx 1.58496 bits of information. 2. **Total Information Needed:** - To unambiguously identify the heaviest and lightest coins among 10 coins, we need to sort them partially to identify the lightest and heaviest. - The information required to fully sort 10 coins is log_2(10!) bits. Calculating: [ log_2(10!) = log_2(3628800) approx 12.29 text{ bits} ] - Since each weighing provides approximately 1.58496 bits of information, we need approximately: [ frac{12.29}{1.58496} approx 7.75 ] weighings to fully sort. However, partial sorting is sufficient if our goal is only to identify the heaviest and lightest coins, which usually requires fewer weighings. 3. **Splitting the Coins:** - We can use a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the number of coins. Let's split the coins into two groups of 5 coins each. 4. **Pairwise Comparisons:** - Weighing the five coins against each other will allow us to rank them partially. - First, weighings required to find some bounds: 1. Compare (1,2), (3,4), and then the remaining coin with the lighter coin from (1,2) to form initial pairs and bounds. 2. Continue pairwise comparisons to narrow down the candidates for the heaviest and lightest coins. 5. **Sequential Comparisons:** - After the initial partition, further sequential comparisons can determine the exact heaviest and lightest. 6. **Illustrative Follow-up Weighings:** - Compare (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), (5 vs 6), (1 vs 3), (5 vs 7) and so forth until every coin has been weighed accordingly. - Generally, each comparison helps discard non-heaviest and non-lightest coins progressively. 7. **Counting the Weighings:** - By setting up pairwise comparisons and evaluating outcomes sequentially, the total number of weighings required typically follows a pattern where: - ( n - 1 ) weighings can provide a relatively stronger ranking order. 8. **Conclusion:** - Using this method with careful pairwise comparison and binary division, we can ensure that both the heaviest and lightest coins are identified within the provided 13 weighings. Therefore, it is indeed possible to determine the heaviest and lightest coin out of 10 coins using exactly 13 weighings.

According to the problem, we have: F = A + 35 The total charge for a patient who receives 5 hours of therapy is 350. This includes the first hour and 4 additional hours. So we can write the equation: F + 4A = 350 Now we can substitute the value of F from the first equation into the second equation: (A + 35) + 4A = 350 5A + 35 = 350 5A = 350 - 35 5A = 315 A = 315 / 5 A = 63 Now that we have the charge for each additional hour (A), we can find the charge for the first hour (F): F = A + 35 F = 63 + 35 F = 98 The total charge for a patient who receives only 2 hours of therapy would be the charge for the first hour plus the charge for one additional hour: Total charge for 2 hours = F + A Total charge for 2 hours = 98 + 63 Total charge for 2 hours = 161 Therefore, the total charge to a patient who receives only 2 hours of therapy is boxed{161} ."},{"prompt":"A student was asked to find the arithmetic mean of the numbers 3, 117, 915, 138, 1917, 2114, and x.

Let's first add the numbers we know: 3 + 117 + 915 + 138 + 1917 + 2114 = 5204 Now, we are told that the remainder in the place of x should be 7. This means that when we divide the sum of all the numbers by the number of numbers (which is 7, since there are 7 numbers including x), the remainder should be 7. Let's denote the sum of all the numbers including x as S. We know that: S = 5204 + x We want to find a value of x such that when S is divided by 7, the remainder is 7. This means that S must be 7 more than a multiple of 7. Let's find the next multiple of 7 after 5204. 5204 divided by 7 gives us 743 with a remainder of 3. This means that 5204 is 3 more than a multiple of 7 (which is 5201). To get to the next multiple of 7, we need to add 4 to 5204, which gives us 5208. But we need a remainder of 7, so we need to add 7 more to this multiple of 7. 5208 + 7 = 5215 So, S should be 5215 for the remainder to be 7 when divided by 7. Now we can find x: S = 5204 + x 5215 = 5204 + x x = 5215 - 5204 x = 11 Now that we have the value of x, we can find the mean of all the numbers: Mean = (3 + 117 + 915 + 138 + 1917 + 2114 + 11) / 7 Mean = (5204 + 11) / 7 Mean = 5215 / 7 Mean = 745 So, the mean of these numbers is boxed{745} ."},{"prompt":"triangle ( ABC ), the angle bisector ( AL ) is drawn.

This condition indicates that the angle bisector of angle A is perpendicular to side BC. Since the angle bisector is also a line of symmetry for angle A, this perpendicularity suggests a special relationship between the sides AB and AC, specifically, AB = AC. 2. **Calculating cos A and Determining angle A** Further, given dfrac{overrightarrow {AB}}{|AB|}cdot dfrac{overrightarrow {AC}}{|AC|}=dfrac{1}{2}, we interpret this as the cosine of angle A since the dot product of two unit vectors gives the cosine of the angle between them.

This satisfies the condition as the piece weighs 100 grams, which is no less than 25 grams. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume that for any ( k leq n ), it is possible to distribute the apples such that each child gets 100 grams and each piece weighs no less than 25 grams. - We need to show that it is possible for ( k = n+1 ). 3. **Ordering the Apples:** - Order the apples ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n+1} ) such that their weights are non-decreasing: ( a_1 leq a_2 leq ldots leq a_{n+1} ). 4. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: ( a_1 leq 75 )** - Since ( a_1 geq 25 ) and the total weight of the apples is ( 100(n+1) ) grams, we must have ( a_{n+1} geq 100 ). - Remove ( 100 - a_1 ) grams from ( a_{n+1} ). Since ( 100 - a_1 geq 25 ), the remaining piece of ( a_{n+1} ) will be ( a_{n+1} - (100 - a_1) geq 25 ). - Now, we have ( n ) apples ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{n+1} - (100 - a_1) ) with a total weight of ( 100n ) grams. - By the inductive hypothesis, we can distribute these ( n ) apples such that each of the ( n ) children gets 100 grams and each piece weighs no less than 25 grams. - **Case 2: ( a_1 > 75 )** - In this case, all apples weigh more than 75 grams. - Let ( k ) be the smallest integer such that ( a_k geq 100 ). - Remove 25 grams from ( a_1 ) and give it to ( c_2 ). Give the remaining ( a_1 - 25 ) grams to ( c_1 ). - Now, ( c_1 ) has ( 100 ) grams. - For ( c_2 ), take ( 125 - a_1 ) grams from ( a_2 ) and give it to ( c_2 ). - Continue this process for ( r = 2, 3, ldots ) until ( c_r = 0 ). 5. **Algorithm Termination:** - The process terminates before ( r = k - 1 ), or else the sum of the weights would exceed ( 100(n+1) ). - At the beginning of step 2, ( a_r leq 75 ) since ( a_r < 100 ) and ( a_r ) gave at least 25 grams to ( c_{r-1} ). - Thus, the algorithm will only end if ( c_r = 0 ). 6. **Conclusion:** - If the algorithm ends after ( r = m ), then we have ( m - 1 ) children with 100 grams each and ( n - m + 1 ) children remaining, with ( n - m + 1 ) pieces of apple that sum up to ( 100(n - m + 1) ) grams. - By the inductive hypothesis, we can distribute these ( n - m + 1 ) apples such that each of the remaining children gets 100 grams and each piece weighs no less than 25 grams. Therefore, by induction, it is always possible to cut the apples such that each child gets 100 grams and each piece weighs no less than 25 grams.

We need to find the perimeter of the last triangle in this sequence that can exist. 2. **Initial Triangle T_1:** The first triangle T_1 has sides 2011, 2012, 2013. 3. **Properties of the Incircle:** The points of tangency of the incircle divide each side into two segments. If AD, BE, and CF are the segments from the vertices A, B, and C to the points of tangency on the opposite sides, then AD = AF, BE = BD, and CF = CE due to the symmetry of the incircle. 4. **Setting Up Equations:** Let AD = x, BD = y, and CE = z. Then, we have: - x + y = 2011 - y + z = 2012 - z + x = 2013 5. **Solving the Equations:** Adding all three equations, we get: [ 2(x + y + z) = 6036 implies x + y + z = 3018 ] Using this in each equation: - x = frac{3018 - 2011}{2} = 503.5 - y = frac{3018 - 2013}{2} = 502.5 - z = frac{3018 - 2012}{2} = 503 Since x, y, z must be integers, we adjust to x = 503, y = 502, z = 503. 6. **Finding Subsequent Triangles:** Each subsequent triangle T_{n+1} has sides AD, BE, CF from T_n. The pattern of side lengths continues with each side differing by 1. This pattern allows us to use the formula for the sides of T_k: [ left(frac{503}{2^{k-3}} - 1, frac{503}{2^{k-3}}, frac{503}{2^{k-3}} + 1right) ] 7. **Determining the Last Triangle:** The triangle inequality must hold, which gives: [ frac{503}{2^{k-3}} - 1 + frac{503}{2^{k-3}} > frac{503}{2^{k-3}} + 1 ] Simplifying, we find k < 11. Thus, T_{10} is the last triangle that can exist. 8. **Calculating the Perimeter of T_{10}:** The sides of T_{10} are frac{375}{128}, frac{503}{128}, frac{631}{128}.

Therefore, the function f(x) reaches its minimum value at x=1, which is f(1) = frac{5}{4}. Since f(frac{1}{e}) = frac{3}{2} + frac{1}{4e^2} and f(e) = frac{1}{2} + frac{e^2}{4}, we have f(e) > f(frac{1}{e}). Therefore, the function f(x) reaches its maximum value at x=e, which is f(e) = boxed{frac{1}{2} + frac{e^2}{4}}.

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, there are at least 52 Sundays in a leap year. The two extra days can be any combination of the seven days of the week. For a leap year to have 53 Sundays, one of the two extra days must be a Sunday. Let's first calculate the probability that a leap year has 53 Sundays. There are 7 possible combinations for the two extra days: (Sun, Mon), (Mon, Tue), (Tue, Wed), (Wed, Thu), (Thu, Fri), (Fri, Sat), (Sat, Sun). Out of these 7 combinations, 2 include a Sunday: (Sun, Mon) and (Sat, Sun). Therefore, the probability that a leap year has 53 Sundays is 2/7. Now, let's calculate the probability that exactly 5 of those Sundays fall in the month of February. February in a leap year has 29 days, which is exactly 4 weeks plus 1 extra day. This means that February will always have exactly 4 Sundays. For February to have a 5th Sunday, the extra day (the 29th of February) must be a Sunday.

If 40% are girls, then 60% are boys (since 100% - 40% = 60%). Number of girls = 40% of 60 students = 0.4 * 60 = 24 girls Number of boys = 60% of 60 students = 0.6 * 60 = 36 boys Each girl drinks 2 cartons of milk per day, and each boy drinks 1 carton of milk per day. However, there is a constraint of 200 cartons of milk available each day. Let's calculate the total consumption without the constraint: Daily consumption without constraint: Girls' consumption = 24 girls * 2 cartons/girl = 48 cartons Boys' consumption = 36 boys * 1 carton/boy = 36 cartons Total daily consumption = 48 cartons + 36 cartons = 84 cartons Since the total daily consumption without the constraint (84 cartons) is less than the available 200 cartons, the constraint does not affect the actual consumption. Therefore, the students can consume their average amount of milk each day. Now, let's calculate the total consumption for one week (5 school days): Weekly consumption: Girls' weekly consumption = 48 cartons/day * 5 days = 240 cartons Boys' weekly consumption = 36 cartons/day * 5 days = 180 cartons Total weekly consumption = 240 cartons + 180 cartons = 420 cartons So, the total number of cartons consumed in one week would be boxed{420} cartons."},{"prompt":"Calculate the following expressions without using a calculator.

If ( n ) has the prime factorization ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ), then the number of divisors ( d(n) ) is given by: [ d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1) ] We need ( d(n) = 900 ). 3. **Factorizing 900**: We factorize 900 to understand the possible forms of ( n ): [ 900 = 2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5^2 ] The number 900 can be expressed as a product of integers in several ways, such as: [ 900 = 9 cdot 10 cdot 10 = 3^2 cdot 10 cdot 10 ] This means the exponents in the prime factorization of ( n ) must satisfy: [ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1) = 900 ] 4. **Considering the modulo condition**: We need to check if there can be 130 consecutive numbers each having exactly 900 divisors.

When p and q work together, their combined work per day is the sum of their individual works per day: [ W_{p+q} = W_p + W_q ] Substituting the expressions for ( W_p ) and ( W_q ) in terms of ( x ), we get: [ W_{p+q} = frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{1.4x} ] We know that when they work together, it takes approximately 14 days to complete the work. This means that their combined work per day is ( frac{1}{14} ) of the total work. So we can set up the equation: [ frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{1.4x} = frac{1}{14} ] To solve for ( x ), we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation: [ frac{1.4 + 1}{1.4x} = frac{1}{14} ] [ frac{2.4}{1.4x} = frac{1}{14} ] Now, we cross-multiply to solve for ( x ): [ 2.4 cdot 14 = 1.4x ] [ 33.6 = 1.4x ] [ x = frac{33.6}{1.4} ] [ x = 24 ] Therefore, it takes p approximately boxed{24} days to complete the work alone."},{"prompt":"The negation of the proposition For any x in mathbb{R}, we have x^2 geqslant 0 is A: For any x in mathbb{R}, we have x^2 < 0 B: There does not exist x in mathbb{R}, such that x^2 < 0 C: There exists an x_0 in mathbb{R}, such that x_0^2 < 0 D: There exists an x_0 in mathbb{R}, such that x_0^2 geqslant 0","completion":"**Analysis** This question mainly tests the negation of a universal proposition.

Decrease = 5% of Rs. 3300 = (5/100) * 3300 = 0.05 * 3300 = Rs. 165 So, the current salary after the reduction = New salary after first raise - Decrease = Rs. 3300 - Rs. 165 = Rs. 3135 Therefore, the typist's current salary is Rs. boxed{3135} ."},{"prompt":"Given f(x) is an even function defined on mathbb{R}, if the graph of f(x) is shifted one unit to the right, the resulting graph is that of an odd function.

We claim that every cycle of sigma must be of length 1 or 4. To prove this, we note that: [ sigma^4(j) = j ] This is because applying sigma four times returns j to its original position, implying that the order of sigma divides 4. Hence, the length of any cycle in sigma must be a divisor of 4, i.e., 1, 2, or 4. 3. We now show that cycles of length 2 and 3 are not possible: - For a cycle of length 2, suppose sigma(a) = b and sigma(b) = a. Then: [ sigma^2(a) = a implies (n + 1) - a = a implies 2a = n + 1 implies a = frac{n + 1}{2} ] Since n is divisible by 4, n + 1 is odd, making frac{n + 1}{2} not an integer, which is a contradiction. - For a cycle of length 3, suppose sigma(a) = b, sigma(b) = c, and sigma(c) = a. Then: [ sigma^3(a) = a implies (n + 1) - ((n + 1) - a) = a implies a = a ] This does not provide any new information, but it implies that a = b = c, which is a contradiction since a, b, c are distinct. 4.

Since Cara has 60 marbles in total, the remaining marbles (which are red and blue) must be: 60 total marbles - 30 (yellow and green) marbles = 30 marbles (red and blue) We are told that the odds of picking a blue marble are 25%, which means that 25% of the remaining 30 marbles are blue. To find the number of blue marbles, we calculate: 25% of 30 marbles = 0.25 * 30 = 7.5 marbles Since we can't have half a marble, let's assume that the number of blue marbles is rounded to the nearest whole number. The closest whole numbers to 7.5 are 7 and 8. However, since the percentage is exactly 25%, the total number of marbles that are either red or blue must be a multiple of 4 (because 25% is 1/4). Therefore, the number of blue marbles must be 8 (since 8 is a multiple of 4 and 7 is not). Now we have 8 blue marbles, and since there are 30 red and blue marbles in total: 30 marbles (red and blue) - 8 blue marbles = 22 red marbles The ratio of the number of red marbles to the number of blue marbles is: 22 red marbles : 8 blue marbles To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: (22 / 2) red marbles : (8 / 2) blue marbles 11 red marbles : 4 blue marbles So the ratio of red marbles to blue marbles is boxed{11:4} ."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},L=["disabled"],N={key:0},E={key:1};function W(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",I,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
