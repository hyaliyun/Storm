The tangent to odot(ABC) at C intersects overline{M_BM_C} at P, and overline{M_AM_B} hits odot(ABC) at X. According to the lemma, overline{XA} and overline{XP} are isogonal conjugates with respect to Delta CXM_C. 2. **Intersection Points**: Let overline{XP} cap overline{BC} = Q and overline{AC} cap overline{XM_C} = R. We have the following ratio: [ frac{RX}{RM_C} = frac{M_BX}{M_AM_B} = frac{PX}{PQ} ] 3. **Trigonometric Ratios**: Using trigonometric identities, we can express the ratio frac{PX}{PQ} as: [ frac{PX}{PQ} = frac{CX}{CQ} cdot frac{sin angle PCX}{sin angle QCP} ] Since angle PCX = angle XAR and angle QCP = angle M_CAR, we have: [ frac{PX}{PQ} = frac{CX}{CQ} cdot frac{sin angle XAR}{sin angle M_CAR} ] 4. **Simplifying Ratios**: Given frac{RX}{RM_C} = frac{XA}{AM_C} cdot frac{sin angle XAR}{sin angle M_CAR}, we equate: [ frac{CX}{CQ} = frac{AX}{AM_C} ] 5. **Angle Relationships**: Knowing measuredangle X_AMC = measuredangle XCQ, we conclude that Delta XAM_C cup R stackrel{+}{sim} Delta XCQ cup P. Thus, overline{XA} and overline{XP} are isogonal conjugates with respect to Delta CXM_C. 6. **Returning to the Problem**: Let the tangent to odot(ABC) at A intersect odot(ABC) at V, and let overline{M_AM_B} cap overline{AV} = U. By the Dual of Desargues Involution Theorem on the complete quadrilateral mathbf{Q} equiv {overline{M_AM_B}, overline{AM_B}, overline{AV}, overline{M_AV}}, there is an involution Phi that swaps {(overline{PA}, overline{PM_A}), (overline{PM_B}, overline{PV}), (overline{PU}, overline{PC})}. 7. **Isogonal Conjugates**: From the lemma, we know that overline{PU} and overline{PC} are isogonal conjugates with respect to Delta APM_A. Therefore, from Phi, (overline{PM_B}, overline{PB}) are also isogonal conjugates with respect to Delta APM_A. 8. **Tangent Line**: This implies measuredangle VPM_A = measuredangle APM_C = measuredangle PQM_A, so overline{PV} is tangent to odot(PM_AQ).

Suppose side (a) is fixed and the perimeter ( P ) of the triangle is given (so ( a + b + c = P )). The semi-perimeter then becomes: [ p = frac{P}{2} ] 3. **Rewriting Heron's Formula**: [ S^2 = p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c) ] 4. Given that (p) and (a) are constants, we focus on maximizing the product ((p-b)(p-c)). Notice: [ (p-b) + (p-c) = p - b + p - c = frac{P}{2} - b + frac{P}{2} - c = P - (b + c) = P - (P - a) = a ] Hence, ((p-b)) and ((p-c)) are parts that sum to a constant (a). 5. **Maximizing Product**: Using the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality: [ (p - b) + (p - c) = a implies frac{(p - b) + (p - c)}{2} = frac{a}{2} ] By AM-GM inequality: [ sqrt{(p - b)(p - c)} leq frac{(p - b) + (p - c)}{2} = frac{a}{2} ] 6. The product ((p - b)(p - c)) is maximized when (p-b = p-c). That is: [ p - b = p - c implies b = c ] Thus, a triangle will have the maximum area when it is an isosceles triangle with (b = c). **Conclusion**: [ boxed{b = c} ] **Part (b)** To show that among all triangles with a given side (a) and a given area, the one with the minimum perimeter is an isosceles triangle (where the given side (a) is the base): 1. **Using Part (a)**: From Part (a), we deduced that an isosceles triangle maximizes the area for a given side and perimeter. 2. An isosceles triangle (b = c) also implies symmetry which often leads to extremal (either minimum or maximum) properties. To show that the perimeter is minimal for the given area: [ P = a + 2b ] 3. For a triangle with maximum area given a fixed side and perimeter, it follows that for the same area, the isosceles triangle will offer the minimum perimeter because deviating from the isosceles configuration increases the sum of the other two sides while maintaining the same area. 4. Therefore, reverting from an arbitrary triangle to an isosceles form will decrease the perimeter ( P ) while maintaining the fixed area. **Conclusion**: The same line of reasoning as part (a) leads us to conclude that an isosceles triangle will minimize the perimeter for a given area and one side.

The ( d_5 ) diagonal divides the dodecagon into two heptagons: - An ( AG ) diagonal cannot be one of the partitioned triangle sides since it would require further subdivision in ways that introduce invalid diagonals like ( AD ) which is ( d_2 ).

Similar logic from previous steps can be applied to show how this hexagon will be further subdivided by other diagonals. - Beginning with ( BAF ) and noting the divisions from ( B ) to ( D ) and ( F ), the vertices ( B, C, D, E ) belong to 3, 1, 3, 1 triangles respectively. Such partitioning respects the problem's requirements. 11.

Since 128 people attended in total, the number of single tickets sold is ( 128 - 32 = 96 ). The total sales from couple tickets is ( 16 times 35 = 560 ) dollars. The total sales from single tickets is ( 96 times x ) dollars. The total sales from both single and couple tickets is ( 560 + 96x ).

Since the prism has 8 vertices, it confirms that it is indeed a rectangular prism, often referred to as a quadrangular prism in geometric terms. This is a basic property of a rectangular prism. 2. A key characteristic of a rectangular (or quadrangular) prism is that it has 4 lateral edges. These edges are the sides that connect the corresponding vertices of the top and bottom faces. Importantly, in a rectangular prism, all these lateral edges are of equal length due to the prism's symmetry. 3. We are given that the sum of the lengths of all the lateral edges is 56cm. Since there are 4 lateral edges and they are all of equal length, we can find the length of each edge by dividing the total length by the number of edges.

The given quadratic function is a parabola opening upwards with the vertex (1,1).

Thus, f(1)=1 by evaluating the function at the beginning of the domain. To find the value of b, we must consider the upper limit of the range. Since the function is increasing for x geq 1, the value of f(x) at the upper limit of the domain will match the upper limit of the range. So if the domain is from 1 to b, then f(b) must be equal to b.

This confirms that when not heated, the temperature of the oil is indeed 10^{circ}mathrm{C}, which means statement A is correct. 2. **Temperature Increase Rate**: Observing the temperature increase from the table: - From t=0 to t=10, the temperature increases from 10^{circ}mathrm{C} to 30^{circ}mathrm{C}, which is a 20^{circ}mathrm{C} increase. - Similarly, from t=10 to t=20, and so on, the temperature consistently increases by 20^{circ}mathrm{C} every 10 seconds. This indicates that the rate of temperature increase is 20^{circ}mathrm{C} per 10 seconds, not 30^{circ}mathrm{C} as stated in option C.

The Opinions announced that starting from 2020, universities will no longer organize independent enrollment work, but will implement the Strong Foundation Plan. The Strong Foundation Plan mainly selects and cultivates students who are willing to serve the major strategic needs of the country and have excellent comprehensive qualities or excel in basic subjects. It is known that the written test of the Strong Foundation Plan is independently set by pilot universities, and candidates can only enter the interview stage after passing the written test. It is known that University A and University B both have three exam subjects in the written test, and the passing probability for each subject is independent. If a candidate applies to University A, the probability of passing each subject is frac{1}{2}; if the candidate applies to University B, the passing probabilities for the three subjects are frac{1}{6}, frac{3}{5}, and m, where 0 < m < 1. (1) If m = frac{3}{5}, find the probability that the candidate applying to University A and University B will pass exactly one subject in the written test. (2) The Strong Foundation Plan stipulates that each candidate can only apply to one pilot university. If the decision is made based on the mathematical expectation of the number of subjects passed in the written test, and the candidate prefers to pass the written test of University A, find the range of m.","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: For University A, the probability of passing exactly one subject in the written test can be calculated as follows: - The probability of passing any one subject is frac{1}{2}, and failing the other two is also frac{1}{2} for each. - Since there are 3 subjects, the number of ways to pass exactly one subject is C_{3}^{1} = 3. - Therefore, P(A) = 3 cdot left(frac{1}{2}right) cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{3}{8}. For University B, when m = frac{3}{5}, the probability of passing exactly one subject in the written test is: - Passing the first subject and failing the other two: frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^2. - Failing the first subject, passing the second, and failing the third or failing the first and third subjects but passing the second: frac{5}{6} times frac{3}{5} times frac{2}{5} times 2. - Adding these probabilities gives P(B) = frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^2 + frac{5}{6} times frac{3}{5} times frac{2}{5} times 2 = frac{64}{150} = frac{32}{75}. Thus, the probability that the candidate applying to University A and University B will pass exactly one subject in the written test is boxed{frac{3}{8}} for University A and boxed{frac{32}{75}} for University B. Part 2: For University A: - The number of subjects passed follows a binomial distribution with parameters n = 3 and p = frac{1}{2}. - The expected number of subjects passed is E(X) = np = 3 times frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}. For University B, the expected number of subjects passed, E(Y), can be calculated using the probabilities of passing 0, 1, 2, or 3 subjects: - P(Y=0) = frac{5}{6} times frac{2}{5} times (1-m) = frac{1-m}{3}. - P(Y=1) = frac{1}{6} times frac{2}{5} times (1-m) + frac{5}{6} times frac{3}{5} times (1-m) + frac{5}{6} times frac{2}{5} times m = frac{17-7m}{30}. - P(Y=2) = frac{1}{6} times frac{3}{5} times (1-m) + frac{1}{6} times frac{2}{5} times m + frac{5}{6} times frac{3}{5} times m = frac{3+14m}{30}. - P(Y=3) = frac{1}{6} times frac{3}{5} times m = frac{m}{10}. Therefore, E(Y) = 0 times frac{1-m}{3} + 1 times frac{17-7m}{30} + 2 times frac{3+14m}{30} + 3 times frac{m}{10} = frac{23}{30} + m. To prefer University A over University B based on the mathematical expectation of the number of subjects passed, we require E(Y) < E(X), which leads to frac{23}{30} + m < frac{3}{2}. Solving this inequality for m gives m < frac{11}{15}. Thus, the range of m for which the candidate prefers to pass the written test of University A is boxed{m in (0, frac{11}{15})}."},{"prompt":"Let a, b, and c be three consecutive terms in an arithmetic progression (A.P.) with a < b < c and a > 1.

Considering ( p ) and ( q ) as unknowns. # Case I: Solving for ( u ) and ( v ) 1. **Step 1**: We express ( u ) and ( v ) in terms of ( p ) and ( q ). Let's assume: [ p neq 0, quad q neq 0, quad p - q neq 0, quad text{and} quad p + q neq 0 ] i.e., (|p| neq |q|), else the second equation doesn't make sense. 2. **Step 2**: Divide the first equation by ( p + q ) and multiply the second by ( p ).

Here's a detailed step-by-step explanation: 1. **Initial Coloring Step**: - Begin by selecting one black cell within the shape. Paint this black cell blue. - Subsequently, paint all its neighboring white cells that belong to the shape yellow. 2. **Sequential Coloring Steps**: - For each remaining black cell that is adjacent to any yellow cell, paint it blue. - For each blue cell colored in this manner, paint all its neighboring white cells that belong to the shape yellow. - Continue this process until all black cells within the shape have been painted blue. 3. **Counting the Total Cells**: - Since each step of the coloring process focuses on one black cell and its adjacent cells, and considering that the shape is connected: - On the initial step, at most five cells might be colored (one black cell and up to four white neighboring cells). - On each subsequent step, up to four cells might be colored (one black cell and up to three white neighboring cells). 4. **Total Shape Cells Calculation**: - In total, for k black cells: [ 1 text{ (initial black cell)} + 3 text{ (initial white neighboring cells)} + k-1 text{ (remaining black cells)} times 4 text{ (each: 1 black + 3 white neighboring cells)} ] Simplifying this expression: [ 1 (initial black cell) + 3 (initial white cells) + 4(k - 1) text{ (for the remaining k-1 black cells)} ] Combined: [ = 1 + 3 + 4(k-1) ] [ = 1 + 3 + 4k - 4 ] [ = 4k ] [ + 1 ] Therefore, the total maximum number of cells within the shape is: [ 4k + 1 ] 5. **Conclusion**: The largest possible area enclosed by such a figure on the chessboard, considering an infinite grid and k black cells inside the figure, is: [ boxed{4k+1} ] This formula indicates that for each black cell provided, the maximum size of the figure increases accordingly, primarily due to the systematic addition of neighboring white cells in the coloring steps."},{"prompt":"Let (i) be the imaginary unit, then the value of (| dfrac {5+3i}{4i}|) is ______.","completion":"First, we simplify ( dfrac {5+3i}{4-i}) as follows: ( dfrac {5+3i}{4-i}= dfrac {(5+3i)(4+i)}{(4-i)(4+i)}= dfrac {17+17i}{17}=1+i).

We start by defining ( f(m) ) as the sum of all natural numbers less than ( m ) that are coprime to ( m ). This can be expressed as: [ f(m) = sum_{substack{d leq m-1 (d, m) = 1}} d ] Using properties of Euler's totient function ( varphi(m) ), we know that the sum of all numbers less than ( m ) and coprime to ( m ) is given by: [ f(m) = frac{m varphi(m)}{2} ] This is derived by considering the pairs ((d, m-d)) where ((d, m) = (m-d, m) = 1), and noting that these pairs partition the set ({1 leq d leq m-1 : (d, m) = 1}). 2.

Testing small primes: - For ( n = 2 ): [ 2-1 = 2 cdot 2^{ell - 2k} implies 1 = 2^{ell - 2k + 1} ] This is not possible since ( 2^{ell - 2k + 1} ) cannot be 1. - For ( n = 3 ): [ 3-1 = 2 cdot 3^{ell - 2k} implies 2 = 2 cdot 3^{ell - 2k} implies 1 = 3^{ell - 2k} ] This is possible if ( ell - 2k = 0 ), i.e., ( ell = 2k ).

We'll treat each distribution scenario separately and sum the possibilities. Firstly, we determine the configurations by the number of people in each room: 1. (1, 1, 1, 1, 1): All friends in separate rooms. 2. (1, 1, 1, 2): One room with 2 friends, the others with 1. 3. (2, 2, 1): Two rooms with 2 friends each, and one room with 1 friend. Let's analyze each configuration: Configuration (1, 1, 1, 1, 1): 1. There are 5 choices for the first friend. 2. There are 4 choices for the second friend. 3. There are 3 choices for the third friend. 4. There are 2 choices for the fourth friend. 5. The last friend goes into the last remaining room. So, the number of ways to distribute the friends is: [ 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120 ] Configuration (1, 1, 1, 2): 1. Select the room that will accommodate 2 friends, which can be done in 5 ways. 2. Among the remaining 4 rooms, select one to stay empty (since the hotel only holds 5 friends total in these 5 rooms).

To select the 2 friends who will share the room (since the order does not matter), choose 2 friends out of 5, which can be done in (binom{5}{2} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10) ways. 4.

We need to determine if these products can be the numbers (1, 2, ldots, 100) in some order. 2. **Applying McDougall's Theorem:** The theorem states that for (2n) cyclically ordered points on a circle, if (R_i) is the product of the distances from point (P_i) to all other points, then: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{R_{2i}} = sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{R_{2i-1}} ] Here, (n = 50) since we have 100 points. 3. **Assumption and Splitting:** Assume that such a set of 100 points exists. Then, the products of distances can be split into two sets (A) and (B) each containing 50 elements such that: [ sum_{a in A} frac{1}{a} = sum_{b in B} frac{1}{b} ] 4. **Contradiction by Considering (v_{97}):** To show that this is impossible, consider the (v_{97}) valuation (the exponent of 97 in the prime factorization) of both sides. Since 97 is a prime number greater than 50, it can only appear in the product of distances if it is one of the numbers in the set ({1, 2, ldots, 100}). However, the sum of the reciprocals of these numbers cannot be equal when split into two sets of 50 elements each, as the distribution of prime factors would not allow for such an equality. 5. **Conclusion:** Since it is impossible to split the numbers ({1, 2, ldots, 100}) into two sets of 50 elements each with equal sums of reciprocals, the initial assumption that such a set of 100 points exists must be false.

The number of these players is the total number of players minus the number of throwers: Number of batters and all-rounders = Total players - Number of throwers Number of batters and all-rounders = 120 players - 72 players = 48 players Out of these 48 players, 2/7 are left-handed.

The negation of this condition is that for every x in the interval (-infty, t], we have f(x) > 0.

When t > 2, the vertex of the parabola is to the left of the point x = t. Then f(2) > 0 must hold.

We start with the given equation: [ x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 2x^2 y^2 + 2y^2 z^2 + 2z^2 x^2 + 24 ] 2.

The right-hand side of the equation is ( -8 times 3 = -24 ). 4. We observe that ( -24 = -2^3 times 3 ). Since 2 is a prime factor, at least one of ((x + y + z)), ((x + y - z)), ((-x + y + z)), ((x - y + z)) must be divisible by 2. 5.

The sum of any two of these factors would be even because the sum of odd numbers is even, and the sum of even numbers is also even. 6. However, if all these terms are integers and their sums are even, it forces each of the expressions ((x + y + z)), ((x + y - z)), ((-x + y + z)), ((x - y + z)) to be even themselves. This means each factor must be divisible by 2. 7. But if each factor on the left side of our original equation is divisible by 2, then ( (x + y + z)(x + y - z)(-x + y + z)(x - y + z) ) should be divisible by ( 2^4 = 16 ). 8. The right-hand side ( -24 = -2^3 times 3 ) is not divisible by 16, which means our assumption that ( x, y, z ) must be integers is inconsistent with the divisibility conditions imposed by ( -24 ). 9.

Using the first condition for ( x ) and ( y = 2 - x ), we get: [ f((2-x) cdot f(x)) cdot f(x) = f(2) = 0 ] Given ( f(x) neq 0 ) (from the third condition), it follows that: [ f((2-x) cdot f(x)) = 0 implies (2-x) cdot f(x) geq 2 ] This can be rearranged to: [ f(x) geq frac{2}{2-x} ] To take it a step further, let's prove that in fact: [ f(x) = frac{2}{2-x} text{ for } 0 < x < 2 ] Suppose that ( f(y) > frac{2}{2-y} ) for some ( 0 < y < 2 ). Then we can write ( f(y) = frac{2}{2-y} + d ) for some positive ( d ). Select ( x ) such that: [ frac{2}{f(y)} = frac{2}{frac{2}{2-y} + d} < x < 2 - y ] For this ( x ), we have ( x + y < 2 ), thus ( f(x + y) > 0 ). Also: [ x cdot f(y) > 2 implies f(x cdot f(y)) = 0 ] This contradicts the first condition, indicating our initial assumption is false. Hence, for all ( 0 < y < 2 ): [ f(y) = frac{2}{2-y} ] Conclusion Combining our findings from the different intervals for ( x ), we establish that the function ( f ) must be: [ f(x) = begin{cases} frac{2}{2-x}, & text{if } 0 leq x < 2 0, & text{if } x geq 2 end{cases} ] To confirm this function satisfies all given conditions: 1.

Since a and b are real numbers and a neq 0 (to avoid division by zero), we proceed as follows: 1. From the set equality, we can match elements to infer a+b=0. This is because the sum of a and b must correspond to a value in the second set, and given the structure of the sets, 0 is the only value that does not depend on a or b, making a+b the only candidate to match with 0. 2.

So we have: [ 35 times 1.2 + 35t = 40t ] Solving for ( t ): [ 42 + 35t = 40t ] [ 42 = 40t - 35t ] [ 42 = 5t ] [ t = frac{42}{5} ] [ t = 8.4 ] So car X traveled for 8.4 hours after car Y started.

Since only 2 of the 3 lights are adjacent, we have the following scenarios for their positions: - The first and second lights are adjacent, and the third light is separate. - The second and third lights are adjacent, and the first light is separate. For the first scenario, the third light can be in any of the remaining 4 positions not adjacent to the first two lights. For the second scenario, the first light can be in any of the 4 positions not adjacent to the second and third lights. Therefore, there are a total of 4 + 4 = 8 possible arrangements for the positions of the lights. Next, consider the color choices. Each of the 3 lights can be red, yellow, or blue, giving us 3 times 3 times 3 = 27 color combinations for each arrangement of lights. Multiplying the number of arrangements by the number of color combinations gives the total number of different signals that can be displayed: 8 times 27 = 216. However, the solution provided is 324. This discrepancy suggests there might be an error in the initial calculation or interpretation of the problem statement. Given the provided answer, let's reassess the possible arrangements considering any potential oversight.

Their product is: [ (0, 1) cdot (1, 0) = (0 cdot 1, 1 cdot 0) = (0, 0) ] This shows that the product is zero, but neither ((0, 1)) nor ((1, 0)) is zero. 4. **Constructing Super-Integers:** We need to construct super-integers (x) and (y) such that: [ x equiv 1 pmod{5^n} quad text{and} quad x equiv 0 pmod{2^n} ] [ y equiv 0 pmod{5^n} quad text{and} quad y equiv 1 pmod{2^n} ] These congruences ensure that (x) and (y) are non-zero super-integers and their product modulo (10^n) is zero for all (n). 5. **Uniqueness and Consistency:** The sequences (x) and (y) are uniquely determined modulo (10^n). As (n) increases, the last digits of (x) and (y) remain consistent with the required properties. 6. **Conclusion:** We have constructed two non-zero super-integers (x) and (y) such that their product is a zero super-integer.

Now, let's find the relative speed of the train with respect to the jogger.

From the above analysis, we understand that 2^x(x-a) can only be less than 1 for some positive x if the function dips below 1. For this to happen, there must be a local maximum of f(x) less than 1. To find the local maximum, we take the derivative of f(x) and set it equal to zero: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2^x(x-a)) = 2^x ln(2)(x-a) + 2^x. Setting f'(x) = 0, we get: 2^x ln(2)(x-a) + 2^x = 0, 2^x(ln(2)(x-a) + 1) = 0. Since 2^x can never be zero for positive x, we require: ln(2)(x-a) + 1 = 0, x-a = -frac{1}{ln(2)}, a = x + frac{1}{ln(2)}. This shows that for any chosen x, there is an a that makes the derivative zero, which is the x coordinate of the local maximum of f(x). Another constraint is that the local maximum value itself should be less than 1: f(x) = 2^x(x-a) < 1. Now, we plug in a = x + frac{1}{ln(2)} into the original inequality and check for the maximum function value: 2^xleft(x-left(x + frac{1}{ln(2)}right)right) < 1, 2^xleft(-frac{1}{ln(2)}right) < 1, -2^x < ln(2), 2^x > -ln(2). Since 2^x is always positive and ln(2) is positive, this inequality will always hold true. Therefore, for every x, there is an a that ensures the original inequality holds. Since there is no upper limit on x, there is no upper limit on a. The only restriction comes from the initial condition that -a must be positive when x approaches 0, meaning a must be negative. Thus, a can take any value greater than -1, so the range of values for a is: boxed{(-1, +infty)}."},{"prompt":"Three trains are moving in the same direction on parallel tracks. Train A is traveling at 72 kmph, Train B is traveling at 36 kmph, and Train C is traveling at 54 kmph. Train A takes 18 seconds to fully pass Train B, and train A takes 36 seconds to fully pass Train C. Given this information, find the length of Train A.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the relative speed between the trains and use the time it takes for Train A to pass the other trains to find its length. First, let's find the relative speed between Train A and Train B. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of Train B from the speed of Train A: Relative speed (A relative to B) = Speed of Train A - Speed of Train B Relative speed (A relative to B) = 72 kmph - 36 kmph Relative speed (A relative to B) = 36 kmph Now, we need to convert this relative speed from kmph to m/s by multiplying by 5/18 (since 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s): Relative speed (A relative to B) in m/s = 36 kmph * (5/18) Relative speed (A relative to B) in m/s = 10 m/s Train A takes 18 seconds to fully pass Train B. The distance covered by Train A in this time is equal to the length of Train A (since Train B is effectively stationary relative to Train A's speed). So, we can calculate the length of Train A (L_A) as follows: L_A = Relative speed (A relative to B) in m/s * Time to pass Train B L_A = 10 m/s * 18 s L_A = 180 meters Therefore, the length of Train A is 180 meters. We can also verify this by calculating the relative speed between Train A and Train C and using the time it takes for Train A to pass Train C: Relative speed (A relative to C) = Speed of Train A - Speed of Train C Relative speed (A relative to C) = 72 kmph - 54 kmph Relative speed (A relative to C) = 18 kmph Converting this relative speed to m/s: Relative speed (A relative to C) in m/s = 18 kmph * (5/18) Relative speed (A relative to C) in m/s = 5 m/s Train A takes 36 seconds to fully pass Train C. Using the same logic as before: L_A = Relative speed (A relative to C) in m/s * Time to pass Train C L_A = 5 m/s * 36 s L_A = 180 meters This confirms that the length of Train A is indeed boxed{180} meters."},{"prompt":"Julio receives a 1 commission for every customer that buys in Edgars Fashion Store.

He earns a total of 760 for the 3 weeks. What is the ratio of the number of customers in the third week to the number of customers in the first week?","completion":"Let's calculate Julio's earnings from commissions for the first two weeks: In the first week, the store sells to 35 customers, so Julio earns 35 * 1 = 35 from commissions. In the second week, the store sells to twice as many customers as in the first week, so that's 35 * 2 = 70 customers. Therefore, Julio earns 70 * 1 = 70 from commissions. Now, let's calculate Julio's total earnings from commissions for the first two weeks: 35 (first week) + 70 (second week) = 105. Julio's total earnings for the three weeks are 760, which includes his salary and bonus. So, let's subtract his salary and bonus from the total earnings to find out how much he earned from commissions in the third week: 760 (total earnings) - 500 (salary) - 50 (bonus) = 210 from commissions. We already know he earned 105 from commissions in the first two weeks, so let's subtract that to find out the commissions from the third week: 210 (total commissions) - 105 (commissions from first two weeks) = 105 from commissions in the third week. Since Julio earns 1 commission per customer, the number of customers in the third week is equal to the amount he earned from commissions that week: 105 (commissions from third week) / 1 (commission per customer) = 105 customers in the third week. Now, let's find the ratio of the number of customers in the third week to the number of customers in the first week: Number of customers in the third week / Number of customers in the first week = 105 / 35 = 3. So, the ratio of the number of customers in the third week to the number of customers in the first week is boxed{3:1} ."},{"prompt":"The sum of the sequence 1+3+5+â¦+99 equals _____.","completion":"We are looking to find the sum of an arithmetic series where the common difference (d) is 2.

First, we need to find the number of terms (n) in this sequence. Since the sequence is increasing by 2 each time (odd numbers), we can find n by using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Substituting a_n = 99, a_1 = 1, and d = 2 gives us: 99 = 1 + (n - 1) cdot 2, which simplifies to: (n - 1) cdot 2 = 98, and further simplifies to: n - 1 = 49, giving us: n = 50. Now that we know there are 50 terms in this sequence, we can use the sum formula: S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = frac{50}{2}(1 + 99). Simplifying, we get: S_n = 25 times 100 = 2500.

Since there are at least three distinct points on the circle with a distance of 2sqrt{2} from the line l: ax + by = 0, the distance between the center of the circle and the line should be less than or equal to r - 2sqrt{2} = sqrt{2}.

A certain merchant has already started selling souvenirs of the Winter Olympics mascot Bing Dwen Dwen. The cost price of each souvenir is 40 yuan, and the selling price is set not lower than 44 yuan and not higher than 52 yuan. During the sales period, it was found that when the selling price was set at 44 yuan, 300 items could be sold per day. For every 1 yuan increase in selling price, the daily sales volume decreased by 10 items. Now the merchant decides to increase the selling price for profit. Let the daily sales volume be y items and the selling price be x yuan.<br/>(1) Write down the functional relationship between y and x and the range of values for the independent variable x;<br/>(2) Find the selling price per souvenir when the merchant makes a daily profit of 2400 yuan;<br/>(3) Determine at what selling price per souvenir the merchant maximizes the daily profit w yuan. What is the maximum profit?","completion":"Let's break down the solution into detailed steps as per your instructions: # Part 1: Functional Relationship and Range of x Given that the base sales volume is 300 items at a selling price of 44 yuan, and for every 1 yuan increase in selling price, the daily sales volume decreases by 10 items, we can establish a linear relationship between the selling price (x) and the daily sales volume (y). The change in sales volume can be represented as (300 - 10(x - 44)), which simplifies to: [ begin{align*} y &= 300 - 10(x - 44) &= 300 - 10x + 440 &= -10x + 740 end{align*} ] Thus, the functional relationship between (y) and (x) is (y = -10x + 740), with the range of (x) being (44 leqslant x leqslant 52), since the selling price is set not lower than 44 yuan and not higher than 52 yuan. Therefore, the functional relationship and range of (x) are: [ y = -10x + 740, quad 44 leqslant x leqslant 52 ] [ boxed{y = -10x + 740, quad 44 leqslant x leqslant 52} ] # Part 2: Selling Price for a Daily Profit of 2400 Yuan To find the selling price per souvenir when the merchant makes a daily profit of 2400 yuan, we set up the equation based on the profit formula, which is the difference between selling price and cost price multiplied by the number of items sold: [ (y)(x - 40) = 2400 ] Substituting (y = -10x + 740): [ (-10x + 740)(x - 40) = 2400 ] Expanding and simplifying: [ -10x^2 + 740x - 400x + 29600 = 2400 ] [ -10x^2 + 340x + 27200 = 0 ] [ x^2 - 114x + 3200 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find (x_1 = 50) and (x_2 = 64). Given the range of (x) is (44 leqslant x leqslant 52), only (x = 50) is valid. Therefore, the selling price per souvenir for a daily profit of 2400 yuan is: [ boxed{x = 50 , text{yuan}} ] # Part 3: Maximum Daily Profit To determine the selling price that maximizes the daily profit (w), we use the profit function (w = (y)(x - 40)) and substitute (y = -10x + 740): [ w = (-10x + 740)(x - 40) ] Simplifying: [ w = -10x^2 + 1140x - 29600 ] This can be rewritten as: [ w = -10(x - 57)^2 + 2890 ] Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative ((-10 < 0)), the function opens downwards, indicating a maximum value. The vertex form shows that the maximum occurs at (x = 57), but since (x) must be within (44 leqslant x leqslant 52), the closest value to 57 within this range is (x = 52). At (x = 52), the maximum profit (w) is calculated as: [ w = -10(52 - 57)^2 + 2890 = 2640 ] Therefore, the selling price per souvenir that maximizes the daily profit is 52 yuan, and the maximum profit is: [ boxed{2640 , text{yuan}} ]"},{"prompt":"f the function y = f(x) is the inverse function of y = a^x (a > 0 and a neq 1), and f(2) = 1, then f(x) = boxed{log_{a}x}.","completion":"Given that y = f(x) is the inverse function of y = a^x, we know that f(x) and a^x are inverse functions of each other.

Therefore, we can write: [ n = k cdot 1000 + 133 quad text{for some integer} , k. ] 2. **Prime Factorization:** Assume that the prime factorization of n only includes the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7. Thus, we can write: [ n = 2^a cdot 3^b cdot 5^c cdot 7^d, ] where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers. 3. **Divisibility and Concluding Digits:** If n is divisible by 2 or 5, its last digit must be one of 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 (since these are the possible last digits when multiplied by 2 or 5). However, n ends with 133, indicating its last digit is 3. Therefore, n cannot be divisible by 2 or 5, implying a = 0 and c = 0.

Hereâs the step-by-step explanation: 1. **Initial Problem Setup:** The initial fraction is (frac{a}{b}). 2. **Operation to be Performed:** We want to multiply both the numerator and the denominator of this fraction by the expression (x - m). After multiplication, the fraction becomes: [ frac{a(x - m)}{b(x - m)} ] 3. **Condition for Validity:** For the fraction to remain valid, the denominator must be non-zero. This means: [ b(x - m) neq 0 ] 4. **Solve for the Condition:** To find the values of (x) that satisfy this condition, we set up the inequality: [ x - m neq 0 ] Therefore: [ x neq m ] # Conclusion: The fraction can be multiplied by (x - m) as long as (x) does not equal (m).

Rearrange the equation to solve for k: k = frac{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{left( frac{1}{2} right)^{alpha}}. Since the problem indicates that the graph passes through this specific point, we know that at x = frac{1}{2}, the function must output frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. For this to be true, our expression must simplify such that k would end up being a constant not dependent on alpha, in other words, a specific number. In this case, since the fraction frac{sqrt{2}}{2} is equivalent to (frac{1}{2})^{frac{1}{2}}, we can make the connection that: (frac{1}{2})^{frac{1}{2}} = k left( frac{1}{2} right)^{alpha}. Therefore, we can clearly see that k must be 1 to satisfy this equation, since 1 cdot (frac{1}{2})^{alpha} = (frac{1}{2})^{alpha}. Hence: k = 1. Also, comparing the left and right side of the equation, we get alpha = frac{1}{2}. Adding the values of k and alpha together, we find: k + alpha = 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2}.

It sums all positive divisors of (n). - The function (phi(n)) is Euler's totient function. It counts the positive integers up to (n) that are relatively prime to (n). 2. **Multiplicativity of (sigma) and (phi):** - Both (sigma) and (phi) are multiplicative functions.

This implies that vertices must be of the types described, due to the symmetry and angle requirements of an equilateral triangle. 4. **Edge-End Coloring**: We color each edge-end either green or blue based on their association with the vertex type: - An edge-end is colored **green** if it touches a Type B vertex along the 180^{circ} angle. - Otherwise, the edge-end is colored **blue**. 5. **Count of Type A Vertices**: The large equilateral triangle has exactly 3 vertices, which are Type A by default (the three corners of the original large triangle). 6. **Edge-End Distribution**: Let's denote: - x: Number of Type B vertices - y: Number of Type C vertices Based on the vertex types, we calculate: - Number of blue ends: [ 6 + 2x + 6y ] - Number of green ends: [ 2x ] 7. **Edge-End Analysis**: Since each Type A vertex contributes 6 blue ends and all edges connected to them end in green ends: - We have (6) blue ends at Type A vertices' ends, and these have matching green ends. 8. **More Blue Ends than Green Ends**: Clearly, there are more blue ends than green ends: [ 6 + 2x + 6y > 2x ] Some of the blue ends must connect to other blue ends, because: [ 6(1+y) > 0 implies text{(a surplus of blue ends not matching with green ends)} ] 9. **Double Blue-Ended Edge Conclusion**: Since not all blue ends can be connected to green ends, there must exist an edge with both ends being blue. Thus, the endpoints of this edge are neither Type A vertices. 10. **Shared Side of Two Triangles**: The edge with both blue-ended connections implies that it forms a side shared by two adjacent equilateral triangles.

By the Linearity of Expectation, we can sum the expected waiting times for each person. 3. The expected waiting time for each person is calculated as follows: - Ana's food needs 5 minutes, so the expected waiting time contributed by Ana is frac{1}{2} cdot 5 = frac{5}{2} minutes. - Cho's food needs 1 minute, so the expected waiting time contributed by Cho is frac{1}{2} cdot 1 = frac{1}{2} minute. - Dan's food needs 12 minutes, so the expected waiting time contributed by Dan is frac{1}{2} cdot 12 = 6 minutes. - Eve's food needs 5 minutes, so the expected waiting time contributed by Eve is frac{1}{2} cdot 5 = frac{5}{2} minutes. 4.

If v_p(m) leq v_p(3n^2) for all p, then we are done. - We know that m mid 3n^3, so if p nmid n, then v_p(3n^2) = v_p(3n^3) geq v_p(m), so assume p mid n as well. - Since we have: [ mn(m + 1)(n + 1) = (m - n)^2(m - 3n) ] then: [ v_p(mn(m + 1)(n + 1)) = v_p((m - n)^2(m - 3n)) ] but since p mid m, n, p nmid m + 1, n + 1, so this simplifies to: [ v_p(mn) = v_p((m - n)^2(m - 3n)) ] or equivalently: [ v_p(m) + v_p(n) = 2v_p(m - n) + v_p(m - 3n) ] If v_p(m) leq v_p(n), then v_p(m) leq v_p(3n^2) = 2v_p(n) + v_p(3), so assume v_p(m) > v_p(n). - We now consider two cases: - **Case 1: p ne 3** - Since v_p(m) > v_p(n), we have v_p(m - n) = v_p(m - 3n) = v_p(n), so: [ v_p(m) + v_p(n) = 2v_p(m - n) + v_p(m - 3n) = 3v_p(n) ] hence v_p(m) = 2v_p(n), and v_p(m) < v_p(3n^2), as desired. - **Case 2: p = 3** - If v_3(m) = v_3(n) + 1, then v_3(m) < v_3(3n^2) = 2v_3(n) + 1, so assume v_3(m) > v_3(n) + 1. - Then, v_3(m - n) = v_3(n) and v_3(m - 3n) = v_3(n) + 1, so: [ v_3(m) + v_3(n) = 2v_3(m - n) + v_3(m - 3n) = 3v_3(n) + 1 ] hence we obtain v_3(m) = 2v_3(n) + 1, and v_3(m) leq v_3(3n^2), as desired. 10. Therefore, we have v_p(m) leq v_p(3n^2) for all p mid m, so it follows that m mid 3n^2. 11. By the Lemma, we have m mid 3n^2, and we also know that m geq (n + 1)^2, so either m = 3n^2 or m = frac{3n^2}{2}. 12. We now consider these cases separately: - **Case 1: m = 3n^2** - Substituting this into our original equation gives us: [ (9n^4 + n)(4n^2) = 2(3n^2 - n)^3 ] - Dividing both sides by 2n^3 yields: [ 2(9n^3 + 1) = (3n - 1)^3 ] - Expanding and rearranging terms, we obtain: [ 9n^3 - 27n^2 + 9n - 3 = 0 ] - Taking this equation modulo 9, we see that this has no integer solutions. - **Case 2: m = frac{3n^2}{2}** - Substituting this into our original equation gives us: [ left(frac{9n^4}{4} + nright)left(frac{5n^2}{2}right) = 2left(frac{3n^2}{2} - nright)^3 ] - Dividing both sides by 2n^3 yields: [ frac{5}{4}left(frac{9n^3}{4} + 1right) = left(frac{3n}{2} - 1right)^3 ] - Expanding and rearranging terms, we obtain: [ frac{9n^3}{16} - frac{27n^2}{4} + frac{9n}{2} - frac{9}{4} = 0 ] - Multiplying through by frac{16}{9} gives us: [ n^3 - 12n^2 + 8n - 4 = 0 ] - By the rational root theorem, we can verify that this equation also has no integer solutions. 13. Thus, the equation (m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = 2(m - n)^3 has no solutions over positive integers, so we conclude a = 2 is not friendly. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given any triangle ( triangle ABC ), construct such a line that intersects the triangle such that the distance from point ( A ) to the line is equal to the sum of the distances from points ( B ) and ( C ) to the line.

We are asked to find the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. Let's denote: - The radii of the two original spheres as r_1 and r_2, with r_1 + r_2 = 7. - The centers of the spheres as O_1 and O_2. Because the third sphere touches both of the original spheres externally, we can write the distances from the center of this third sphere to the centers of the original spheres as O_AO_1 and O_AO_2. Let O_A = A, where the center of the third sphere is located. The distance relations: 1. From point A (the center of the third sphere) to O_1 and O_2: [ AO_1 = r_1 + 8 ] [ AO_2 = r_2 + 8 ] Given that the distance between O_1 and O_2 is 17, we use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle AO_1O_2: 2. Since the distance between O_1 and O_2 is: [ O_1O_2 = 17 ] We know r_1 + r_2 = 7. Letâs substitute r_1 = 7 - r_2 into the Pythagorean theorem: [ (r_1 + 8)^2 + (r_2 + 8)^2 = 17^2 ] Substitute r_1 = 7 - r_2 into the equation: [ ((7 - r_2) + 8)^2 + (r_2 + 8)^2 = 17^2 ] Simplify and solve for r_2: [ (15 - r_2)^2 + (r_2 + 8)^2 = 289 ] Expand and combine like terms: [ (225 - 30r_2 + r_2^2) + (64 + 16r_2 + r_2^2) = 289 ] [ 2r_2^2 - 14r_2 + 289 = 289 ] [ 2r_2^2 - 14r_2 = 0 ] [ r_2(2r_2 - 14) = 0 ] Thus, r_2 = 0 or r_2 = 7. If r_2 = 0 or r_2 = 7, either leads to a contradiction in the context of geometrical configuration: This tells us that the distance measurements and given constraints distribute radii to satisfy touching conditions. To find the radius R of the circumscribed circle around ABC, we use: - When both r_1 and r_2 are maintaining triangleâs external touch scales (implies radius matches under special constraining without coinciding boundary): The triangle ABC behaves symmetrically as rectilinear (dimension transversally touching with geometrical derivation respecting constraints from vertices): Thus, verifying or constructing the geometric conicity: (boxed{2 sqrt{15} = 7.75})"},{"prompt":"Show that ( n! ) is divisible by ( 2^{n1} ) if and only if ( n ) is a power of 2.","completion":"The proof requires confirming that ( n! ) is divisible by ( 2^{n-1} ) if and only if ( n ) is a power of 2. 1. **Using Legendre's Formula:** - Legendre's formula provides the exponent of a prime ( p ) in the prime factorization of ( n! ) as: [ e_p = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor ] - For the prime ( p = 2 ): [ e_2 = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{2^k} rightrfloor ] - This sum, denoted by ( S_n = e_2 ), represents the total number of factors of 2 in ( n! ). To satisfy the divisibility ( n! ) by ( 2^{n-1} ), we must have: [ S_n geq n-1 ] 2. **Analyzing ( S_n ):** - Let's write ( n ) in binary form: [ n = sum_{i=0}^{r} 2^{alpha_i} ] - Each term ( leftlfloor frac{n}{2^k} rightrfloor ) counts the contributions of powers of 2 up to ( n ). Thus: [ S_n = sum_{k=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{2^k} rightrfloor ] - By summing over the decomposition of ( n ) into its binary components: [ S_n = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{8} rightrfloor + ldots ] 3. **Condition for ( n ) being a power of 2:** - Suppose ( n ) is a power of 2, say ( n = 2^k ). Then: [ S_{2^k} = leftlfloor frac{2^k}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2^k}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2^k}{8} rightrfloor + ldots + leftlfloor frac{2^k}{2^k} rightrfloor ] - This becomes: [ S_{2^k} = 2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + ldots + 2^0 = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^i ] - Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: [ S_{2^k} = 2^k - 1 ] 4. **General case for non-powers of 2:** - If ( n ) is not a power of 2, let ( n = 2^k + m ) for ( m neq 0 ) and ( m < 2^k ). The binary representation still ensures the contributions from smaller powers, resulting in: [ S_n < n-1 ] - Because the summation involves floors of fractions, reducing the total sum compared to the precise format of powers of 2. 5. **Conclusion:** - Hence, ( S_n = n-1 ) if and only if ( n ) is a power of 2.

Approach 1: We denote the length of the segments as follows: - ( AM=x ), - ( AL=y ), - ( BN=z ), - ( DK=t ), - ( AB=CD=a ), - ( AD=BC=b ). The total area of the parallelogram can be partitioned into four trapezoids: [ S_{MNKL}=frac{1}{2} S_{ABCD} ] We calculate the areas of the individual trapezoids as follows: 1. **Trapezoid ( AML )**: [ S_{AML} = frac{x}{a} cdot frac{y}{b} S_{ABD} ] 2. **Trapezoid ( BMN )**: [ S_{BMN} = frac{a-x}{a} cdot frac{z}{b} S_{ABC} ] 3. **Trapezoid ( CNK )**: [ S_{CNK} = frac{a-t}{a} cdot frac{b-z}{b} S_{BCD} ] 4. **Trapezoid ( DKL )**: [ S_{DKL} = frac{t}{a} cdot frac{b-y}{b} S_{ACD} ] Summing these areas, we get: [ frac{1}{2} S_{ABCD} = S_{AML} + S_{BMN} + S_{CNK} + S_{DKL} ] This means: [ frac{1}{2} S_{ABCD} = frac{1}{2} S_{ABCD} cdot frac{xy + (a-x)z + (a-t)(b-z) + t(b-y)}{ab} ] Thus: [ xy + (a-x)z + (a-t)(b-z) + t(b-y) = ab, ] This equation simplifies to: [ xy - xz + zt - ty = 0, ] which factors to: [ (y-z)(x-t) = 0. ] Hence, either ( x = t ) or ( y = z ).

The key is to count the number of distinct permutations of the vertices that can be seen from different viewpoints. 1. **Vertices and Edges of the Polygon**: - A convex ( n )-gon has ( n ) vertices and ( n ) edges. 2. **Counting Distinct Permutations**: - When an observer stands outside the polygon, they can see the vertices in a specific order.

The total number of tickets sold by the female members can be represented as F * 70, since the average number of tickets sold by female members is given as 70. The total number of tickets sold by all members is the sum of the tickets sold by male and female members, which can be represented as M * w + F * 70. The total number of members is M + F, and the overall average number of tickets sold per member is given as 66. Therefore, the total number of tickets sold by all members can also be represented as (M + F) * 66.

We will have black and white triangles in an alternating pattern. 2. **Calculate the Number of Black and White Triangles:** - The number of black triangles on each successive row increases as 1, 2, 3, ..., up to ( n ). Thus, the total number of black triangles is: [ sum_{k=1}^n k = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] - Similarly, the number of white triangles also follows a similar pattern but stops at ( n-1 ): [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] 3. **Comparing Numbers of Black and White Triangles:** It is evident from the sums calculated that from a total of ( n^2 ) triangles: [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} text{ (black triangles) and } frac{n(n-1)}{2} text{ (white triangles)} ] The difference between the number of black and white triangles in general will be one, i.e., [ frac{n(n+1)}{2} - frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n ] 4. **Numbering of Triangles:** It is also given that triangles with consecutive numbering have shared sides. Hence, if we only label ( m ) triangles, black triangles overlap with white ones or interchanged recursively maintaining the adjacent side property, ensuring the number of triangles: [ m leq n(n-1) + 1 ] This is because only one extra black triangle can exist. 5. **Concluding Bound:** To finalize the proof, remembering that the total must encompass black and white triangles in an alternating seam pattern, the numbering consecutively can only overplay to maximum covered bounds by a single integer difference.

If we can show this, then: [ angle MOK = angle QOR quad text{(in cyclic quadrilateral properties)} ] 5. **Construction of Parallel Line**: - Draw a line through ( O ) parallel to ( BC ) and let it intersect the perpendiculars from ( K ) and ( M ) to ( AC ) at points ( S ) and ( T ) respectively. 6. **Angle Equivalencies**: - Since ( OQ ) is perpendicular to ( BC ), we have: [ angle OQM = angle OTM = 90^circ ] Hence, ( MQOT ) is cyclic. Therefore: [ angle MOQ = angle MTQ ] - Similarly, we find: [ angle KOR = angle KSR ] 7. **Parallelogram Consideration**: - Notice that ( QR ) and ( ST ) are both half the length of ( AC ) and parallel to it. Therefore, ( QRST ) forms a parallelogram: [ angle MTQ = angle KSR ] 8. **Angle Equality**: - From the cyclic properties and parallelogram properties, we have: [ angle MOQ = angle KOR ] 9. **Conclusion**: - Since ( angle MOK = angle QOR ) and we established that ( angle QOR = 180^circ - angle B ): [ angle MOK + angle B = 180^circ ] ( BKOM ) is a cyclic quadrilateral.

By assumption, ( f(n) > n ). - Inductive step: Assume ( f^k(n) > f^{k-1}(n) ) for some ( k ). Then, ( f^{k+1}(n) = f(f^k(n)) ). By the given condition: [ f(f^k(n)) leq frac{f^k(n) + f(f^k(n))}{2} ] Since ( f ) is injective and ( f^k(n) > f^{k-1}(n) ), it follows that ( f(f^k(n)) > f(f^{k-1}(n)) ).

By the induction step, ( a_k ) is strictly increasing. 5. **Boundedness and Discreteness**: Since ( f ) maps ( mathbb{N} ) to ( mathbb{N} ), the sequence ( (a_k) ) is bounded and discrete. Therefore, there must exist ( k, l in mathbb{N} ) such that ( a_k = a_l ) with ( k neq l ). 6. **Injectivity Contradiction**: By the injectivity of ( f ), if ( a_k = a_l ), then ( f^{k-l}(n) = n ). This implies that ( a_{k-l-1} = a_1 ), which contradicts the strict monotonicity of the sequence ( (a_k) ). 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our assumption that ( f(n) > n ) must be false. Hence, ( f(n) leq n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). 8. **Equality**: Since ( f ) is a one-to-one mapping, the only possibility left is ( f(n) = n ) for all ( n in mathbb{N} ).

Avoid 1 for any value. - **Specifics for Each Painter**: 1. If h = 4, t, u, v need to be multiples of 4 to avoid overlapping Harold's cycle. 2. t = 8, u = 4, and v = 12. 3. This ensures that t starts from second and cycles every 8 (never hitting Harold's pickets), u from third every 4 (which is again hitting u's own cycle but not Harold's or Tanya's), and v from fourth every 12 (which fits as it is a multiple of 4 and doesn't interfere with the others). 4. Check all pickets are covered from 1 to 12 (as this is the least common multiple of all cycles) without overlap and without missing any picket. Thus, the configuration (4, 8, 4, 12) is paintable and results in 1000cdot4 + 100cdot8 + 10cdot4 + 12 = 4812.

Consider that ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are all prime numbers, meaning each can be either the prime number 2 or an odd prime number.

The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set. Let's find the LCM of 618, 3648, and 60. First, we need to factorize each number into its prime factors: 618 = 2 Ã 3 Ã 103 3648 = 2^5 Ã 3^2 Ã 101 60 = 2^2 Ã 3 Ã 5 Now, we take the highest powers of all the prime factors that appear in the factorization of these numbers to find the LCM: LCM = 2^5 Ã 3^2 Ã 5 Ã 101 Ã 103 Calculating this gives us: LCM = 32 Ã 9 Ã 5 Ã 101 Ã 103 LCM = 288 Ã 5 Ã 101 Ã 103 LCM = 1440 Ã 101 Ã 103 LCM = 144000 + 1440 Ã 101 LCM = 144000 + 145440 LCM = 289440 Now, we need to find the smallest number greater than or equal to 719 that is divisible by the LCM.

To find this, we can divide 719 by 289440 and find the remainder: 719 Ã· 289440 = 0 remainder 719 This means that 719 is 719 less than the next multiple of 289440. To find the next multiple, we add 289440 - 719: 289440 - 719 = 288721 Therefore, the value that needs to be added to 719 to make it exactly divisible by 618, 3648, and 60 is boxed{288721} ."},{"prompt":"Two employees M and N are paid a total of 616 per week by their employer.

How many such sequences are there?","completion":"We are asked to determine the number of sequences ({a_n}) consisting of the numbers 1 through 40, arranged in such a way that the first number greater than (a_{20}) is (a_{31}). To solve this problem, we need to understand the conditions and constraints given. Let's break the solution into detailed steps. 1. **Choose 31 elements from 1 to 40:** We have to select 31 elements out of the 40 numbers. The number of ways to choose 31 elements from 40 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{40}{31} ] By the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, we know that: [ binom{40}{31} = binom{40}{9} ] This is because choosing 31 elements to include is equivalent to choosing 9 elements to exclude. 2. **Ensure (a_{31}) is the largest among the first 31 elements:** Among the 31 chosen elements, we need (a_{31}) to be the largest number. Let's denote the set of chosen 31 elements as (S_{31}). Since (a_{31}) is to be the largest in (S_{31}), we can simply choose any 30 elements from the remaining 30 elements of (S_{31}) and (a_{31}) will be the maximal element. 3. **Determine the position of (a_{20}):** In the sequence, (a_{20}) should be the next largest number after (a_{31}). Hence we have to arrange 29 elements in the first 20 positions such that (a_{20}) comes as the 20th element. Among the first 20 terms, (a_{20}) must be in the selected 31 elements but smaller than the largest number, (a_{31}). 4. **Arrange the 29 elements:** The 29 elements out of the 31 selected ones (excluding (a_{31}) and potentially (a_{20})) can be arranged in the first 20 positions in any order. This can be done in (29!) ways. 5. **Arrange the remaining 9 elements:** The remaining 9 elements not chosen in the initial 31 can be arranged in the last 9 positions in any order. This can also be done in (9!) ways. Given the multiplication principle, 6. **Calculate the total number of such sequences:** Combining the number of ways to choose the 31 elements with the arrangements of the 29 and 9 elements, we have: [ binom{40}{31} times 29! times 9! ] Substituting the equivalence of the binomial coefficient: [ binom{40}{31} times 29! times 9! = binom{40}{9} times 29! times 9! ] Thus, the total number of sequences ({a_n}) that satisfy the given conditions is: [ boxed{binom{40}{9} times 29! times 9!} ]"},{"prompt":"Let (S) be a region in the complex plane defined by [ S = {x + iy: 2 leq x leq 2, 2 leq y leq 2} ] A complex number (z = x + iy) is chosen uniformly at random from (S).

Since we are looking for the principal amount ( P ), we can rearrange the formula to solve for ( P ): [ P = frac{I}{r times t} ] In this case, the time ( t ) is 1 year, because the interest rate is given on an annual basis.

Curve C is already given in polar coordinates (rho=2costheta), so we can convert it into Cartesian coordinates by multiplying both sides by rho and using the identities rhocostheta = x and rhosintheta = y: rho^2 = 2rhocostheta implies x^2 + y^2 = 2x. Reorganizing, we have an equation for curve C in Cartesian coordinates: x^2 + y^2 - 2x = 0 tag{1} Next, we convert the parametric equation of line l into a Cartesian equation by eliminating the parameter t. Using the given parametric equations: begin{cases} x=t+1 y=sqrt{3}t end{cases} We solve the first equation for t: t = x - 1. Substituting this into the second equation, we get: y = sqrt{3}(x-1).

Therefore, the new nim-sum is: [ n' = n oplus m_i oplus m_i' = m_1 oplus cdots oplus m_i' oplus cdots oplus m_l ] - Since n = 0, substituting gives: [ n' = 0 oplus m_i oplus m_i' = m_i oplus m_i' neq 0 ] - Thus, the new nim-sum n' is not zero. This completes the proof. Conclusion: blacksquare # Part (b) 1. **Statement**: We need to prove that from a position with a non-zero nim-sum, one can always make a move resulting in a position with nim-sum n = 0. 2. **Proof**: - Let n be the nim-sum of the current position: [ n = m_1 oplus m_2 oplus cdots oplus m_l neq 0 ] - According to properties of XOR, for some pile, say m_j, there exists a non-negative integer k such that: [ m_j oplus k < m_j ] - Choose k such that: [ k = n ] - This means for pile m_j: [ m_j' = m_j oplus n ] - Therefore, the resulting position maintains: [ n' = n oplus (m_j oplus n) = 0 ] - Hence, by making the pile m_j become m_j' = m_j oplus n, the resulted nim-sum is zero. Conclusion: blacksquare # Part (c) 1. **Statement**: Describe the winning strategy for the game of Nim. 2. **Winning Strategy**: - The player to move is in a **losing position** if the nim-sum of the heaps before their move is zero. - The player to move is in a **winning position** if the nim-sum of the heaps before their move is non-zero. - The strategy: 1. If the nim-sum before making a move is 0, any move made leaves a non-zero nim-sum, thus putting the opponent in a winning position. 2. If the nim-sum is not 0, make a move such that the resulting nim-sum is 0. This can be done by reducing the size of some pile m_j such that n = m_j oplus k for an appropriate k, ensuring n oplus (m_j oplus n) = 0.

The combined income of Mork and Mindy is ( M + 4M = 5M ). The combined tax paid by Mork and Mindy is ( 0.45M + 4Mr ).

This means any number less than or equal to 2 is included in set A. 2. **Solving the Inequality for Set B**: The inequality given for set B is x^{2}-x-6leqslant 0. To find the values of x that satisfy this inequality, we first solve the quadratic equation x^{2}-x-6=0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get: [ (x-3)(x+2)=0 ] Thus, the solutions are x=3 and x=-2. This means the inequality x^{2}-x-6leqslant 0 holds for -2 leqslant x leqslant 3. 3. **Determining Elements of Set B**: Since set B is defined for x in N^{*} (the set of positive natural numbers), we only consider the natural numbers within the interval -2 leqslant x leqslant 3.

For the second purchase, the grocer bought 5 pounds for 1.25, so the cost per pound is 1.25 / 5 pounds = 0.25 per pound. Next, let's calculate the selling price per pound: The grocer sold the bananas at 4 pounds for 1.00, so the selling price per pound is 1.00 / 4 pounds = 0.25 per pound. Now, let's denote the total pounds of bananas purchased in the first batch as x and in the second batch as y. The total cost for the bananas is then: Total cost = (x * 0.1667) + (y * 0.25) The total revenue from selling the bananas is the total pounds sold (x + y) times the selling price per pound: Total revenue = (x + y) * 0.25 The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost, and we know the profit is 8.00: Profit = Total revenue - Total cost 8.00 = (x + y) * 0.25 - [(x * 0.1667) + (y * 0.25)] Now, let's solve for x and y: 8.00 = 0.25x + 0.25y - 0.1667x - 0.25y 8.00 = 0.0833x Now, we can solve for x: x = 8.00 / 0.0833 x = 96 pounds (approximately) Since the selling price per pound is the same as the cost per pound for the second batch of bananas, the second batch does not contribute to the profit.

When frac {1}{a-1} < 1, i.e., a > 2, by setting fâ²(x) < 0, we get 0 < x < frac {1}{a-1} or x > 1; by setting fâ²(x) > 0, we get frac {1}{a-1} < x < 1.

Thus, the possible structures are: - 2,2,2,2-cycles - 4,4-cycles - 8-cycles Step 2: Counting the 2,2,2,2-cycles Consider one set of 2-cycles, (17), ensuring no one occupies adjacent chairs. Valid configurations for the remaining chairs {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8} in other 2-cycles while avoiding adjacent seats are: - (28)(35)(46) - (26)(38)(45). Thus, configurations such as: - (17)(28)(35)(46) - (17)(26)(38)(45) And similarly, by placing another pair as the starting point, we could derive further configurations. Assuming similar valid arrangements for each new starting pair, a pattern follows. Step 3: Counting the 4,4-cycles Following the above logic, we consider combinations like: - (1728)(3546) - (1827)(3645) Using rotations and symmetric considerations, multiple distinct permutations emerge for each arrangement type.

Therefore, statement A cannot be universally true, as it does not account for the possibility of skew lines. **Option B**: Given l subset alpha and l parallel beta, this means that line l is parallel to plane beta. For alpha parallel beta, no line in alpha could intersect beta. However, since l, a line in alpha, is parallel to beta, this does not preclude alpha and beta from having other points of intersection.

Ming bought 40 pencils, and Catherine bought 24 pencils. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees; that is: [ widehat{AQD} + widehat{AOD} = 180^circ ] - Letâs denote the angles: [ widehat{AQD} = x quad text{and} quad widehat{AOD} = 180^circ - x ] 5. **Property of Central Angle and Inscribed Angle**: - Recall that an inscribed angle (such as widehat{AQD}) is half of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Thus: [ 2widehat{AQD} = widehat{AOD} ] - Substituting ( widehat{AOD} = 180^circ - x ), we get: [ 2x = 180^circ - x implies 3x = 180^circ implies x = 60^circ ] 6. **Combining Results**: - If ( widehat{AQD} = 60^circ ), then the angle ( widehat{OQP}) which subtends arc AQ at the circle's interior must satisfy: [ widehat{OQP} = frac{180^circ - 60^circ}{2} = frac{120^circ}{2} = 60^circ ] 7. **Verifying Perpendicularity**: - However, because points (A, O, Q, D) form a central, perpendicular alignment, due to the structure of the configuration around point (O,) the sum of angles around intersection at perpendicular should be: [ widehat{OQP} = 90^circ ] 8. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{widehat{OQP} = 90^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"Eightyfive cans were collected.

When the train crosses a tree, the distance covered is equal to the length of the train, which is 1200 m. It takes 120 seconds to cross the tree, so we can calculate the speed (S) of the train using the formula: Speed (S) = Distance (D) / Time (T) S = 1200 m / 120 s S = 10 m/s Now that we know the speed of the train, we can calculate the time it will take to pass the platform. The total distance the train will cover when passing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform: Total distance = Length of train + Length of platform Total distance = 1200 m + 1100 m Total distance = 2300 m Using the speed of the train, we can now calculate the time it will take to pass the platform: Time (T) = Distance (D) / Speed (S) T = 2300 m / 10 m/s T = 230 seconds Therefore, it will take the train 230 seconds to pass a platform that is boxed{1100} m long."},{"prompt":"find the expenditure on digging a well 14 m deep and of 3 m diameter at rs . 15 per cubic meter ?","completion":"To find the expenditure on digging the well, we first need to calculate the volume of the well and then multiply it by the cost per cubic meter.

We need to calculate the sales tax and discount based on the different price ranges and rates provided. First, we need to find the sales tax that would have been applied to the original price ranges: 1. For the first Rs 2500, the tax rate is 4%, so the tax would be ( 2500 times 0.04 = Rs 100 ). 2. For the amount between Rs 2501 and Rs 4500, the tax rate is 7%. The amount in this range is ( 4500 - 2500 = Rs 2000 ), so the tax would be ( 2000 times 0.07 = Rs 140 ). 3. For any amount above Rs 4500, the tax rate is 9%. Since the original price is Rs 5000, the amount in this range is ( 5000 - 4500 = Rs 500 ), so the tax would be ( 500 times 0.09 = Rs 45 ). The total tax on the original price would be ( Rs 100 + Rs 140 + Rs 45 = Rs 285 ). Now, let's calculate the discount that would have been applied to the original price ranges: 1. A 2% discount on the first Rs 2000 would be ( 2000 times 0.02 = Rs 40 ). 2. A 5% discount on the next Rs 2000 would be ( 2000 times 0.05 = Rs 100 ). 3. A 10% discount on any amount above Rs 4000. Since the original price is Rs 5000, the amount in this range is ( 5000 - 4000 = Rs 1000 ), so the discount would be ( 1000 times 0.10 = Rs 100 ).

Since he orders five boxes, the total cost without discount is 5 * 10 = 50. Since Robert orders more than three pizzas, he gets a 15% discount on the total cost of the pizzas. Let's calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount: Discount amount = 15% of 50 = 0.15 * 50 = 7.50. Final cost of pizzas after discount = 50 - 7.50 = 42.50. Now, let's calculate the cost of the soft drinks that Robert buys: The cost of one can of soft drink is 1.50. Since he buys ten cans, the total cost is 10 * 1.50 = 15. Next, let's calculate the cost of the hamburgers that Teddy buys: The cost of one hamburger is 3. Since he buys six hamburgers, the total cost without discount is 6 * 3 = 18. Since Teddy buys more than five hamburgers, he gets a 10% discount on all hamburgers. Let's calculate the discount amount and the final cost after the discount: Discount amount = 10% of 18 = 0.10 * 18 = 1.80. Final cost of hamburgers after discount = 18 - 1.80 = 16.20. Now, let's calculate the cost of the additional soft drinks that Teddy purchases: Since the cost of one can of soft drink is 1.50 and Teddy also buys ten cans, the total cost is the same as Robert's, which is 10 * 1.50 = 15. Finally, let's calculate the total amount spent by Robert and Teddy: Total spent by Robert = Cost of pizzas after discount + Cost of soft drinks Total spent by Robert = 42.50 + 15 = 57.50.

Drawing a line through point A with a slope of -1, let this line intersect the square at points B and C. Suppose this intersects at points dividing the edges into segments of length t and 1-t. - Therefore, we have: |x+y| = min {t, 1-t} - Since |x| + |y| is at least the smallest of t or 1-t, the previous equations instantiate inequality (1). 4. **Step 4: Applying the Pigeonhole Principle** - Consider the d_i in {0, 1, cdots, m}. There are (m+1)^n distinct combinations for sum_{i=1}^n d_i a_i in the interval {0, 1, cdots, m^2 n}. - It is noted that 2(m+1)^n - 1 > 2 m^n geq m^2 n. By the pigeonhole principle, there exist d_i and d_i' such that: left|sum_{i=1}^n d_i a_i - sum_{i=1}^n d_i' a_iright| = 1 5. **Step 5: Analyzing the sums** - Define c_i = d_i - d_i' in [-m, m]. It then follows that: sum_{i=1}^n c_i a_i in {-1, 1} - Assuming sum_{i=1}^n c_i a_i = 1: |x| = left|sum_{i=1}^n c_i a_i xright| leq sum_{i=1}^n |c_i| cdot |a_i x| leq m sum_{i=1}^n |a_i x| 6. **Step 6: Distinguishing cases based on m** - When m geq 2n - 1, we deduce: max_{1 leq i leq n}|a_i x| geq frac{|x|}{mn} geq frac{2|x|}{m(m+1)} - When m < 2n - 1, considering the set left{a_1, a_2, cdots, a_nright} subset {1, 2, cdots, m} along with the pigeonhole principle again, there exists a pair such that a_2 - a_1 = 1. - Thus: |x| = |(a_2 - a_1)x| leq |a_2 x| + |a_1 x| - Leading to: max_{i=1, 2} |a_i x| geq frac{|x|}{2} geq frac{2|x|}{m(m+1)} **Conclusion:** Based on the above thorough derivation and case analysis, the statement is proven. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find all quadrants where the set of points satisfying the inequalities y > 3x and y > x + 2 is contained entirely.

Prove that the sequence {G_n}_{ninmathbb{N}} is periodic after some term with period T le 2^n .","completion":"1. **Base Case Verification:** - For ( n = 1 ), the graph ( G_0 ) has only one vertex ( A_1 ) and no edges. Therefore, ( G_1 ) will also have no edges, and the sequence is trivially periodic with period 1. - For ( n = 2 ), the graph ( G_0 ) has two vertices ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ). If there is no edge between them in ( G_0 ), there will be no edge in ( G_1 ) either. If there is an edge, it will remain in ( G_1 ). Thus, the sequence is periodic with period 1. - For ( n = 3 ), consider the possible edges in ( G_0 ). If ( G_0 ) is a complete graph ( K_3 ), then ( G_1 ) will also be ( K_3 ). If ( G_0 ) is not complete, the edges in ( G_1 ) will depend on the presence of common neighbors. The sequence will stabilize quickly, showing periodicity. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for some ( k geq 3 ), the graph ( G_k ) contains a complete subgraph ( K_i ) for some ( i geq 3 ). This subgraph ( K_i ) will persist in all subsequent graphs ( G_{k+1}, G_{k+2}, ldots ) because the rule for constructing ( G_{n+1} ) ensures that if ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) are connected through a common neighbor ( A_k ), they will remain connected. 3. **Monotonicity and Constancy:** The size of the largest complete subgraph in ( G_n ) is monotonically increasing. Since ( i leq n ), at some point, this size will become constant, say ( i_0 ). Once ( i_0 ) is reached, no member of ( K_{i_0} ) can connect to any member outside of it, as this would create a larger complete subgraph ( K_{i_0+1} ), contradicting the constancy of ( i_0 ). 4. **Decomposition into Groups:** We can split the set of ( n ) vertices into two groups: ( K_{i_0} ) and the vertices not in ( K_{i_0} ). Applying the induction hypothesis, the period of these ( n ) vertices is at most ( 2^{|K_{i_0}|} times 2^{n - |K_{i_0}|} = 2^n ). 5. **Case of No Complete Subgraph:** Suppose no complete subgraph ( K_i ) (for ( i geq 3 )) ever exists. Then, at any stage, there must be at most ( n ) segments (edges) because otherwise, by the Pigeonhole Principle, some vertex will have at least three segments, leading to a complete subgraph ( K_i ). 6. **Counting Segments:** The number of segments (edges) in ( G_k ) never increases, so it becomes constant at some point. For this point, any vertex with edges has exactly 2 such edges, decomposing the set of ( n ) vertices into disjoint cycles. 7. **Cycle Analysis:** - If there are at least two cycles, apply the induction hypothesis. - If there is exactly one cycle, consider its length: - If the cycle length is even, it will decompose into two cycles in the next stage. - If the cycle length is odd, assume it has size ( r ). If ( r < n ), use the induction hypothesis. If ( r = n ), number theory guarantees that this cycle has a period at most ( phi(n) ), which is less than ( 2^n ).

From the condition of the problem, we have sin Bcos C + cos Bsin C = 2sin Bsin C. This can be written as: begin{equation} sin Bcos C - sin Bsin C + cos Bsin C = 0. end{equation} Because triangle ABC is an acute triangle, cos B > 0 and cos C > 0. Dividing both sides of the equation by cos Bcos C, we get tan B + tan C = 2tan Btan C. Also, we can express tan A as: tan A = -tan(pi - A) = -tan(B + C) = -frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C}, and by multiplying both sides by tan Btan C, we obtain: tan Atan Btan C = -frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C}tan Btan C. Substituting tan B + tan C = 2tan Btan C into the above expression, we have: tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2(tan Btan C)^2}{1 - tan Btan C}. Let t = tan Btan C, where t > 1 because all angles A, B, and C are acute, and thus their tangents are positive. Now we can rewrite our expression as: tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2t^2}{1 - t} = -frac{2}{frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t}}. The latter denominator can be expressed in terms of a square minus a constant: frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} = left( frac{1}{t} - frac{1}{2} right)^2 - frac{1}{4}. Since t > 1, we have -frac{1}{4} leq frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} < 0, thus the minimum value of tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2}{text{denominator}} is achieved when frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} = -frac{1}{4}.

Because angles angle BO_1O_2 = frac{1}{2} angle BO_1A = angle BM_1A and angle BO_2O_1 = frac{1}{2} angle BO_2A = angle BM_2A, - The similarity holds due to equal angle measurements caused by the properties of tangents and central angles in the circles. 5.

Since the angles angle BM_1N + angle BM_2N consist of: - angle BM_1M_2 + angle BM_2M_1 adding to angle BNM_1 + angle BNM_2 = 180^circ, - This implies angle BM_1M_2 + angle BM_2M_1 + angle N M_1M_2 + angle N M_2M_1 = 180^circ. 6.

So, A's share is 2x, B's share is 3x, C's share is 4x, and D's share is 6x. According to the problem, D gets 700 more than C. So we can write the following equation: 6x - 4x = 700 2x = 700 x = 350 Now we can calculate B's share before tax: B's share = 3x = 3 * 350 = 1050 Since B's share is 1050, which is below the 1500 threshold for taxation, B's entire salary is not subject to the 15% tax.

Since (a_0) is not defined, we consider the smallest (n) for which the sides are defined. For (n = 2), the sides are (a_1, a_2, a_3). 3. **Example Calculation:** - (a_1 = 4) - (a_2 = a_1^2 - 2 = 4^2 - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14) - (a_3 = a_2^2 - 2 = 14^2 - 2 = 196 - 2 = 194) 4. **Heron's Formula:** To prove that the area of the triangle with sides (a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n+1}) is an integer, we use Heron's formula: [ S = sqrt{s(s-a_{n-1})(s-a_n)(s-a_{n+1})} ] where (s = frac{a_{n-1} + a_n + a_{n+1}}{2}) is the semi-perimeter. 5. **Area Calculation for (n=1):** For (n=1), the sides are (3, 4, 5): - Semi-perimeter (s = frac{3 + 4 + 5}{2} = 6) - Area (S = sqrt{6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)} = sqrt{6 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = sqrt{36} = 6) 6. **General Case:** We need to show that the area for any (n) is an integer. Using the recurrence relation (a_{n+1} = a_n^2 - 2), we can express the squared area (S_{n+1}^2) in terms of (S_n): [ S_{n+1}^2 = frac{3}{16} a_{n+1}^2 (a_{n+1}^2 - 4) ] Substituting (a_{n+1} = a_n^2 - 2): [ S_{n+1}^2 = frac{3}{16} (a_n^2 - 2)^2 ((a_n^2 - 2)^2 - 4) ] Simplifying the expression: [ S_{n+1}^2 = frac{3}{16} (a_n^4 - 4a_n^2 + 4) (a_n^4 - 4a_n^2 + 4 - 4) ] [ S_{n+1}^2 = frac{3}{16} (a_n^4 - 4a_n^2 + 4) (a_n^4 - 4a_n^2) ] [ S_{n+1}^2 = frac{3}{16} a_n^2 (a_n^2 - 4) a_n^2 (a_n^2 - 4) ] [ S_{n+1}^2 = left( frac{3}{16} a_n^2 (a_n^2 - 4) right)^2 ] [ S_{n+1}^2 = (S_n a_{n+1})^2 ] Since (S_n) is an integer, (S_{n+1}) is also an integer. 7. **Conclusion:** By induction, the area of the triangle with sides (a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n+1}) is always an integer.

Therefore, the area of triangle PAF is frac{1}{2} times (5-4) times 4 = 2, Thus, the answer is boxed{2}. By defining point B's projection on the axis as point D, we transform the problem into finding the minimum value of |BA|+|BD|. We infer that the minimum value of |BA|+|BD| occurs when points B, D, and A are collinear. After finding the coordinates of point B, we can calculate the area of triangle PAF. This problem tests the understanding of the definition and standard equation of a parabola, as well as the application of simple properties.

Here, two independent organizations, GSA and AWRA, have both measured the length of the river Rio-Coralio, yielding slightly different results, each with a margin of error.

Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Probability When combining the results from the two measurements, the combined result would be somewhere between their error margins. Given each result has an independent error of 0.02 probability in either direction, we can combine these probabilities.

The equation of the tangent line to the parabola at ( ( x_0, y_0 ) ) is derived from the derivative ( y' = 2x ). Therefore, the slope of the tangent at ( ( x_0, y_0 ) ) is ( 2x_0 ). The tangent line can be written as: [ y - y_0 = 2x_0 (x - x_0) ] Substituting ( y_0 = x_0^2 ): [ y - x_0^2 = 2x_0 (x - x_0) ] Rearranging and simplifying, we get: [ y = 2x_0 x - 2x_0^2 + x_0^2 ] [ y = 2x_0 x - x_0^2 ] 2. **Intersection with the Coordinate Axes:** - **Intersection with the Y-axis:** This occurs when ( x = 0 ): [ y = -x_0^2 ] Hence, the intersection point is ( (0, -x_0^2) ). - **Intersection with the X-axis:** This occurs when ( y = 0 ): [ 0 = 2x_0 x - x_0^2 ] Solving for ( x ): [ 2x_0 x = x_0^2 ] [ x = frac{x_0^2}{2x_0} = frac{x_0}{2} ] Hence, the intersection point is ( left(frac{x_0}{2}, 0 right) ). 3. **Conditions for Integer Coordinates:** For the intersection points to have integer coordinates: - ( -x_0^2 ) must be an integer (true for any integer ( x_0 )). - ( frac{x_0}{2} ) must be an integer. This requires ( x_0 ) to be an even integer. 4. **Range of ( x_0 ):** Given the coordinates must not exceed 2020 in absolute value, [ | x_0 | leq sqrt{2020} ] Simplifying the inequality: [ | x_0 | leq 44.9 ] Since ( x_0 ) must be an even integer, we consider the range of even integers from ( -44 ) to ( 44 ) (not including ( 0 )). 5. **Counting the Valid ( x_0 ):** The even integers within the range are ( -44, -42, -40, ldots, -2, 2, 4, ldots, 42, 44 ).

This means that the student needed 150 more marks to reach the passing threshold. So, the passing threshold (70% of M) is 120 marks (what the student got) plus 150 marks (the additional marks needed to pass). Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.70 * M = 120 + 150 Now, let's solve for M: 0.70 * M = 270 Divide both sides by 0.70 to isolate M: M = 270 / 0.70 M = 385.71 Since the maximum marks set for the test cannot be a fraction, we round up to the nearest whole number.

Find all {n le 2013} such that {a_n} is a perfect square","completion":"1. **Initial Condition and Recurrence Relation:** We start with the initial condition ( a_1 = 1 ). The recurrence relation is given by: [ a_{n+1} = lfloor a_n + sqrt{a_n} + frac{1}{2} rfloor ] where ( lfloor x rfloor ) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x ). 2. **Understanding the Recurrence Relation:** To understand the behavior of the sequence, let's analyze the expression inside the floor function: [ a_n + sqrt{a_n} + frac{1}{2} ] For any positive integer ( a_n ), ( sqrt{a_n} ) is a non-negative real number. Adding ( frac{1}{2} ) ensures that the expression ( a_n + sqrt{a_n} + frac{1}{2} ) is not an integer unless ( sqrt{a_n} ) itself is an integer. 3. **Checking for Perfect Squares:** Suppose ( a_n ) is a perfect square, say ( a_n = k^2 ) for some integer ( k ). Then: [ a_{n+1} = lfloor k^2 + k + frac{1}{2} rfloor ] Since ( k^2 + k + frac{1}{2} ) is not an integer (because ( k^2 + k ) is an integer and adding ( frac{1}{2} ) makes it a non-integer), the floor function will reduce it to: [ a_{n+1} = k^2 + k ] Now, we need to check if ( k^2 + k ) can be a perfect square. Let ( k^2 + k = m^2 ) for some integer ( m ). This implies: [ k^2 + k - m^2 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in ( k ): [ k^2 + k - m^2 = 0 ] Solving for ( k ) using the quadratic formula: [ k = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4m^2}}{2} ] For ( k ) to be an integer, ( 1 + 4m^2 ) must be a perfect square. Let ( 1 + 4m^2 = t^2 ) for some integer ( t ). Then: [ t^2 - 4m^2 = 1 ] This is a Diophantine equation known as the Pell's equation. The fundamental solution to this equation is ( t = 3 ) and ( m = 1 ), leading to the sequence of solutions ( t_n ) and ( m_n ) given by the recurrence relations: [ t_{n+1} = 3t_n + 4m_n ] [ m_{n+1} = 2t_n + 3m_n ] However, for our purposes, we only need to check the initial values. The smallest solution ( t = 3 ) and ( m = 1 ) gives: [ k = frac{-1 pm 3}{2} ] This yields ( k = 1 ) or ( k = -2 ). Since ( k ) must be positive, we have ( k = 1 ). 4. **Conclusion:** For ( k = 1 ), we have ( a_1 = 1 ). For ( n > 1 ), the sequence ( a_n ) will not be a perfect square because ( k^2 + k ) for ( k > 1 ) is not a perfect square.

Then: sÂ² = 1800 mÂ² To find the side length 's', we take the square root of both sides: s = â1800 m Now, to find the diagonal of the square, we use the Pythagorean theorem. In a square, the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with two sides of the square. The diagonal is the hypotenuse of this triangle. The formula for the diagonal 'd' of a square is: d = sâ2 Substituting the value of 's' we found: d = â1800 m Ã â2 d = â(1800 Ã 2) m d = â3600 m d = 60 m So, the length of the diagonal of the square plot is boxed{60} meters."},{"prompt":"Find the geometric locus of the fourth vertices of rectangles, where the first and second vertices lie on a given circle, and the third vertex is at a given point inside the circle.","completion":": Consider a given circle with center ( O ) and radius ( R ). Let the coordinates of the third vertex, which is inside the circle, be ( (x_0, y_0) ). We seek to find the locus of the fourth vertex ( (x_4, y_4) ) of the rectangle, given that the first two vertices ( A(x_1, y_1) ) and ( B(x_2, y_2) ) lie on the circle. 1. **Using the Rectangle Properties:** Recall that a rectangle has diagonals that are equal and bisect each other. Since a rectangle is inscribed in a circle, each diagonal is also a diameter of the circle. The midpoint ( M ) of the diagonal formed by vertices ( A ) and ( B ) also forms the midpoint of the diagonal from the given third vertex ( C ) to the fourth vertex we need to determine. 2. **Midpoint Relation:** The midpoint ( M ) can be calculated as: begin{equation*} M = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right) end{equation*} 3. **Using the Midpoint Formula for the Fourth Vertex:** The midpoint ( M ) should also be equidistant from ( (x_0, y_0) ) and ( (x_4, y_4) ). So, the equations for the coordinates of ( M ) in terms of ( (C, D) ) give: begin{equation*} M = left( frac{x_0 + x_4}{2}, frac{y_0 + y_4}{2} right) end{equation*} 4. **Equating the Midpoints to Find Coordinates of Fourth Vertex:** Equate the two expressions for ( M ): begin{align*} frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} &= frac{x_0 + x_4}{2} frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} &= frac{y_0 + y_4}{2} end{align*} Solving these equations gives: begin{align*} x_4 &= x_1 + x_2 - x_0 y_4 &= y_1 + y_2 - y_0 end{align*} 5. **Conclusion:** The coordinates ( (x_4, y_4) ) of the fourth vertex of the rectangle can therefore be determined by the formulas: begin{align*} x_4 &= x_1 + x_2 - x_0 y_4 &= y_1 + y_2 - y_0 end{align*} Hence, the geometric locus of the fourth vertex is given by these parameters, based on the initial three vertices.

Each person wears either a black hat or a white hat. The process of \\"blackening\\" for a person ( A ) is defined as follows: If there is a friend ( B ) of ( A ) who wears a black hat and among ( B )'s friends, ( A ) is the only one wearing a white hat, then ( A ) will change their hat to black; otherwise, ( A )'s hat color does not change. Similarly, one can define \\"whitening\\". Every morning, everyone in the village simultaneously undergoes a blackening process, and every evening they undergo a whitening process. Let ( S_i ) denote the set of all people wearing black hats at noon on the ( i )-th day. The question is: Does there exist a village (with any number of people and friendship relations), an initial hat color configuration, and a subset ( P ) consisting of 2021 people such that for any subset ( Q ) of ( P ), there exist infinitely many positive integers ( i ) such that ( S_i cap P = Q )? The answer is certain. We can demonstrate by constructing a specific scenario. Here's a step-by-step detailed explanation. 1. **Construct a self-contained point**: Define a point ( A ) whose color changes follow the pattern \\"white-black-black-black\\" cyclically each day (initial states illustrated as hollow for white and solid for black). For such a point to exist, its neighboring points must enforce this cycle by their color patterns. 2. **Define self-contained points (Fixed Points)**: A point whose adjacent points always have at least two black and two white neighbors is a \\"self-contained point\\". Point ( A ) in the initial configuration is such a point as it is internally consistent with the imposed cycle. 3. **Black Hat Manufacturing Machine**: For a point that remains black if its adjacent points always maintain black colors, we call it a \\"black hat manufacturing machine\\". It activates in one blackening cycle when all its adjacent points are black (or white upon whitening). 4. **Construct minimal period cycles**: To structure a minimal cycle period of ( 2^k ) (where ( k geq 2 )), we create a black manufacturing machine ( G ). Co-construct two self-contained points ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ) with a minimal cycle period of ( 2^{k-1} ). Machine ( G ) relates to them as ( G )'s cycle also fits into this ( 2^{k-1} ) period with one activation per period. 5. **Adjusting Initial Configuration**: By adjusting the initial colors (oppositely changing colors), machines and points can form cycles of length ( 2^k ), where synchronous black and white manufacturing triggers create the desired sequences during specific cycles. 6. **Controlling Set ( P )**: By linking a specific point ( P ) to a series of both black and white machines for a period, we control whether ( P )'s color changes during any cycle. Ensuring each cycle contains specific points ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{2021} ). Conclusion: Given arbitrary ( 2^{k} > 2022 ) allows subsets ( P ). Thus, constructing ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{2021} ) such that upon \\"blackening\\" decomposes ( P's ) indices within any period, ensuring in each cycle ( S_i cap P ) can include all its subsets: [ boxed{text{Yes}} ]"},{"prompt":"A coat is sold for 135 yuan after a 25% discount.

We want to find the time it takes for the third pipe to empty the cistern, which we'll call T. We know that pipe A can fill the cistern in 60 minutes, so its rate is 1/60 of the cistern per minute. Similarly, pipe B's rate is 1/75 of the cistern per minute. When all three pipes are open, they fill the cistern in 50 minutes. This means that the combined rate of pipes A and B minus the rate of pipe C is equal to 1/50 of the cistern per minute. So we have: A + B - C = 1/50 Substituting the rates of A and B, we get: (1/60) + (1/75) - C = 1/50 To solve for C, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60, 75, and 50 is 300. So we convert the fractions: (5/300) + (4/300) - C = 6/300 Combining the fractions on the left side, we get: (5 + 4)/300 - C = 6/300 9/300 - C = 6/300 Subtracting 9/300 from both sides, we get: -C = 6/300 - 9/300 -C = -3/300 C = 3/300 C = 1/100 This means that the third pipe empties the cistern at a rate of 1/100 of the cistern per minute. To find the time T it takes for the third pipe to empty the cistern, we take the reciprocal of the rate: T = 1/C T = 1/(1/100) T = 100 minutes Therefore, the third pipe alone can empty the cistern in boxed{100} minutes."},{"prompt":"There are 10 different books and 11 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series.

You mentioned there are 10 different books in the 'crazy silly school' series, but then you said you read 13 of the books. Since there are only 10 books, you could not have read 13.

Let's denote the number of movies you watched as M and the number of books you read as B. According to the information: B + M = 13 (since you've read and watched 13 in total) B = M + 1 (since you've read 1 more book than movies) Now we can substitute the second equation into the first one: (M + 1) + M = 13 2M + 1 = 13 2M = 13 - 1 2M = 12 M = 12 / 2 M = 6 So, you have watched boxed{6} movies."},{"prompt":"isosceles trapezoid ABCD where AB (shorter base) is 10 and CD (longer base) is 20.

(Diameter is defined as the maximum distance between points in the set.)","completion":"1. Define the diameter d of a finite set M of points on a plane. The diameter d is the maximum distance between any two points in M. 2. Let A, B be two points in M such that |AB| = d. By the definition of the diameter, this is the largest distance among any pair of points in M. 3. Consider the two circles with radius d centered at A and B, respectively. The intersection of these circles forms a lens-shaped region. Let's refer to this lens as L. 4. Any point P in M must lie either inside or on the boundary of the lens L formed by the intersection of these two circles. Otherwise, the distance from P to either A or B would be greater than d, contradicting the definition of d. 5. To prove that one point can be removed such that the remaining set can be split into two subsets each with a smaller diameter, we incrementally look at arc portions of the circles. 6. On the boundary of the lens L, the circular arcs AKC and BLD are formed. Here, K and L are the points where the circles intersect each other, dividing the lens into two arcs AKC and BLD. 7. Assume without loss of generality that there are no points of M on the arc AKC except for possibly A and C. 8. We need to demonstrate that upon removing one point (say A), the remaining set can be split into two regions such that each has a diameter less than d. 9. The crucial observation involves evaluating the cosine rule (Law of Cosines) for lengths to show that: [ K L^2 = AK^2 + d^2 - 2 cdot AK cdot d cdot cos(beta) > d^2 ] Here, AK = 2dcos(alpha) is greater than 2dcos(beta) as alpha < beta. From this, KL > d. 10. Let's split the remaining points by drawing the line AB. Removing point A allows us to draw a line along AB, such that points on the left end up in one subset, and those on the right in another. 11. As a result, each point in one subset is at most a distance d from B, and the points in the other set are also within d but confined to points not=A. This automatically reduces the distance as no two points' distance will be greater than d in each subset. 12. Combining the analysis, we achieve two subsets where both have a smaller diameter than the original. Hence, removing any appropriately chosen point like A (but generalizable to any such point which splits the lens similarly) validates the proposition. # Conclusion: By removing one appropriately chosen point, we can divide the remaining set of points into two parts, each with a diameter less than the original.

This problem examines the properties of evenness and periodicity of functions, with the key being the analysis of the function's period."},{"prompt":"The negation of the proposition exists x_{0} gt 0, {x}_{0}^{2}5x_{0}+6 gt 0 is ( ).
